# Pandaqi Studio

This is the full source code / project behind [Pandaqi](https://pandaqi.com), my game studio website.

It contains the pages and files for all my games, both video games and board games. Many of my board games are generated on the website itself, though, so it also contains those generators.

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while.

* The actual website (hosted online) is inside `pandaqi-studio`
* Anything in development is kept in `pandaqi-studio-dev`. (Once done, I transfer the game / update to the real version.)
* Everything else is metadata or supportive documents for the project.

My broken old laptop can't handle any automatic systems for syncing or deploying. Fortunately, I don't finish games every single day of course, so I'm fine with manual copying once in a while. It keeps things simple and minimal.

This is by far my largest project. Hence, some sub projects have their own GitHub repository.

* [Pandaqi Blog](https://github.com/Pandaqi/Pandaqi-Blog) => my blog that mostly contains devlogs / diaries about these games
* [Pandaqi Tutorials](https://github.com/Pandaqi/Pandaqi-Tutorials) => my huge tutorials website with free interactive courses on lots of things
* I've written many custom libraries powering all of this, which you can find on my GitHub account.

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. In fact, as expected, you'll find many projects that are yet to release or even finish in the development environment.

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do. 

Adding an external reward to any work, such as money, only encourages bad practices, destroys intrinsic motivation, and inevitably leads to shady secret practices. I used to love making games just because---then I hated it for years as I was told I need to be successful and make money from it. 

So yeah, all I do is free and in the open, and I just hope to add joy to the world or help people learn through my work.

Maybe, just maybe, this disease will spread and we can have an actual free and happy society in my lifetime.
