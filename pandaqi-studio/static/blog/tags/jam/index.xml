&lt;p&gt;It will be quite brief, because it was for a very short game jam (&lt;em&gt;The Jame Gam 33&lt;/em&gt;) and I had no time to actually track this diary while making the game. So I&amp;rsquo;m giving all my thoughts a few days &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; finishing the game and not touching it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bombgoggles</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/bombgoggles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/bombgoggles/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my devlog for the game &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.itch.io/bombgoggles/"&gt;Bombgoggles&lt;/a&gt;. It will be a very brief one, because it&amp;rsquo;s a very short jam (it&amp;rsquo;s literally called the &lt;em&gt;Mini Jam&lt;/em&gt;) and I can&amp;rsquo;t even use most of the time we do get. Nevertheless, I think through problems and ideas by &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; in this devlog (like a diary), so I&amp;rsquo;m creating one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bot Bouldering</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/bot-bouldering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/bot-bouldering/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the devlog for one of my ideas for the GMTK Jam 2024. It was a mess, things weren&amp;rsquo;t working, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting it all because it helps me think through the problems. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s fun/instructive for others to read too!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Druids in the Dark</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/druids-in-the-dark/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/druids-in-the-dark/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my devlog for the game &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.itch.io/druids-in-the-dark/"&gt;Druids in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;. It was made for a Game Jam (by PirateSoftware) in very little time, because I was too busy finishing other projects. That&amp;rsquo;s why the devlog will be quite short and the game idea isn&amp;rsquo;t as creative/experimental as I&amp;rsquo;d normally do. Nevertheless, I wanted to detail the general process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Finside Out &amp; Inside Sprout</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/finside-out-and-inside-sprout/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/finside-out-and-inside-sprout/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my devlog for the game jam called &lt;em&gt;So you WANNA Jam!? 2024&lt;/em&gt;. The jam was held from August 3th to August 12th by the YouTuber/Game Developer Wannibe Manisha.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sunbluck</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/sunbluck/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/sunbluck/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my devlog for the game &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.itch.io/sunbluck/"&gt;Sunbluck&lt;/a&gt;. It was made for the &lt;em&gt;Godot Wild Jam 72&lt;/em&gt; in a few days, which is why this devlog will be rather brief. Nevertheless, I want to talk about the process, any interesting challenges or situations, and anything else that seems worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Less is Store</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/less-is-store/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/less-is-store/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the devlog for &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.itch.io/less-is-store"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Less is Store&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This game was created for the GoGodot Jam (iteration 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I made an entirely different idea for this game jam. But my laptop is old and broken, and that idea was 3D &amp;hellip; so after a few days, it just gave up. It crashed all the time, out of nowhere. And even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t, it was just too &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;laggy&lt;/em&gt; to stay motivated and productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Windup Wizards</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-windup-wizards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-windup-wizards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so, the GoGodot Jam 2 happened. I decided to participate. This
was decided well in advance, and I scheduled my other projects around
it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ho Ho Sombrero</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-ho-ho-sombrero/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-ho-ho-sombrero/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my devlog for the game &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.itch.io/ho-ho-sombrero"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ho Ho Sombrero&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of December, the &amp;ldquo;New Horizons&amp;rdquo; game jam came on my radar.
Even though I&amp;rsquo;d already done &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; huge game jams in November, and
wasn&amp;rsquo;t really looking to do another, the theme just resonated with me:
make a game that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; and about &lt;em&gt;new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Windowsilk</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-windowsilk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-windowsilk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my devlog for the game &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/windowsilk"&gt;Windowsilk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local multiplayer game for 1-X players, playing spiders moving across
an increasingly chaotic web, catching bugs and avoiding falling off
their web.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
