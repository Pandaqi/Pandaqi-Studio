Most of the games I submitted ended up quite good and received high ratings. The worst one, by far, was &lt;em&gt;Bombgoggles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Problem of Dreamshrink</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-problem-of-dreamshrink/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-problem-of-dreamshrink/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every idea for a creative project starts full of opportunities. This is nice. You feel motivated, you&amp;rsquo;re interested to see where all these ideas lead, and you feel creatively fulfilled. You write down more and more ideas every hour, while you start implementing/executing the first ones, and you&amp;rsquo;re still dreaming of creating your masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Every Game is a Distribution Problem</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/every-game-is-a-distribution-problem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/every-game-is-a-distribution-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this article brief, because the title has already given the big insight that I want to share. &lt;strong&gt;Every game is a distribution problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Game Dev: How to prioritize?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/game-dev-how-to-prioritize/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/game-dev-how-to-prioritize/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is another one that came out of my recent &amp;ldquo;summer of game jams&amp;rdquo;. I participated in 10 game jams, which was indeed stressful and a lot of work, but also taught me a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Game Dev: What are you telling players?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/game-dev-what-are-you-telling-players/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/game-dev-what-are-you-telling-players/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to take a short break during the summer and participate in a few game jams again. I ended up joining nearly 10 of them, and submitting for most, which was quite stressful and I probably should&amp;rsquo;ve actually taken a &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, this obviously taught me a lot about game design and gave me some new insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Summer of Game Jams (2024)</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-summer-of-game-jams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-summer-of-game-jams/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2024, I quite spontaneously participated in 10 game jams over a period of a few weeks. I just picked the ones that seemed reasonable well-hosted and started/ended within my self-assigned summer break. And when I say spontaneous, I really mean it. I&amp;rsquo;d actually planned something entirely different, but, well, things happened, and before I knew it September had started and I&amp;rsquo;d made a dozen video games.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Story Told by Mini-Games</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-story-told-by-mini-games/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-story-told-by-mini-games/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have always played two types of video games. About 10% of them are strategical simulations such as Rollercoaster Tycoon (and recently Parkitect, of course), and the other 90% are local coop games such as Overcooked and Towerfall.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Should you let your kids win?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/should-you-let-your-kids-win/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/should-you-let-your-kids-win/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A recurring issue when playing games is a skill gap. This is most common when parents play a game with their kids, but also happens for example when people with different levels of gaming experience (in general) approach a game.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why rules should be less strict</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/why-rules-should-be-less-strict/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/why-rules-should-be-less-strict/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning, explaining, testing and designing board games for a long while now. You can comfortably call me a real gamer, a &amp;ldquo;seasoned gamer&amp;rdquo;, a heavy gamer. I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who can&amp;rsquo;t stand people that say &amp;ldquo;the rules are more like guidelines, aye?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Finding Fonts &amp; Licensing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/finding-fonts-and-licensing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/finding-fonts-and-licensing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is about how to deal with &lt;strong&gt;fonts&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to creative projects. I explain where I find my fonts, but mostly about &lt;em&gt;licensing&lt;/em&gt; and things to look out for. Because I&amp;mdash;like many&amp;mdash;learned about this way too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why I created "The Peerful Project"</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/the-peerful-project/why-i-created-the-peerful-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 21:55:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/the-peerful-project/why-i-created-the-peerful-project/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the project yet, visit the official page: &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/the-peerful-project"&gt;The Peerful Project&amp;mdash;Free Local Multiplayer Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wrote an in-depth article series about &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/the-peerful-project/pizza-peers/devlog-pizza-peers/1-how-i-created-pizza-peers/"&gt;How I Created &amp;ldquo;Pizza Peers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It covers many of the same topics and
ideas, and actually shares the code I used, in case you want to create
your own games like these.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
