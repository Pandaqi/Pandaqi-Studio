It was made for a Game Jam (by PirateSoftware) in very little time, because I was too busy finishing other projects. That&rsquo;s why the devlog will be quite short and the game idea isn&rsquo;t as creative/experimental as I&rsquo;d normally do. Nevertheless, I wanted to detail the general process.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>The theme of the Game Jam was &ldquo;Shadows & Alchemy&rdquo;. No further restrictions, besides the usual &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be an asshole&rdquo; and &ldquo;make sure you&rsquo;re allowed to use your assets&rdquo; and such.</p><p>I almost exclusively make and play local multiplayer games, so I immediately thought: &ldquo;what if you run a potion shop TOGETHER?&rdquo;</p><p>One special part of this jam is that you must provide both the game <em>and</em> a Game Design Document for it. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I chose to participate. I have never made a GDD before, and I don&rsquo;t think it will suit me, but I want to at least <em>try</em> and maybe learn something.</p><p>While writing that document, I had to explain how my game fit the theme, which forced me to come up with a few more twists.</p><ul><li>SHADOWS I: Each player has a shadow around them with a limited range. This means you <em>can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s on those adjacent tiles.</em> You must either memorize where the thing is that you need, or walk away until it&rsquo;s visible again. (Or, if playing together, hope the other player knows and communicates that.)</li><li>SHADOWS II:</li><li>ALCHEMY I: Obviously, you&rsquo;re running around collecting the right ingredients for potions.</li><li>ALCHEMY II: These ingredients don&rsquo;t just grow in your shop / await you in storage, however. The only thing that automatically appears are <em>finished potions</em>. By walking through those, you dissolve/break them into their original components. <em>Those</em> can be picked up.</li><li>ALCHEMY III: The recipes are randomly generated. The only way to view them is by visiting the Recipe Book cell, which is similar to discovering new formulas / hidden knowledge all the time.</li></ul><p>I thought this would work quite well. The shadow forces you to memorize or communicate with your fellow players. The fact you need to break down potions and build them in a different way fits the core process of alchemy, and is different from what such games usually do.</p><p>Most importantly, we only need a <em>single</em> control for all of this: walking. It simplifies development for me. It also makes it far more likely people will try the game (and/or be able to convince someone else to try it with them).</p><p>Bringing it all together, this is the general game loop.</p><ul><li>Customers appear that want specific potions.</li><li>You must break down existing potions, then fumble through the dark to grab their components that you need, and deliver the wanted potion in time.</li><li>Fail once ( = the timer runs out before you deliver the right thing) and you die.</li><li>If you&rsquo;ve served all customers before dying, you pass this round.</li></ul><h2 id=my-personal-challenges>My personal challenges</h2><p>It&rsquo;s boring and useless, to me, to repeat the exact same workflow all the time. So, even if I&rsquo;m quite happy with certain habits of mine (or my game engine, or my coding style), I still want to try 1 or 2 completely different approaches to challenge myself.</p><p>For this game jam, my &ldquo;personal challenges&rdquo; were &mldr;</p><ul><li>No UI. Everything is an actual part of the game world and I must find clever ways to get rid of any interface.</li><li>When coding, turn every possible action/interaction into a small &ldquo;module&rdquo; on the player. (For example, the interaction &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s anything on your new cell, pick it up&rdquo; is a tiny module with 10 lines of code. The same for &ldquo;walk over a potion? break it into pieces&rdquo; or &ldquo;walk over the garbage bin? throw away what you have&rdquo; and so forth.)</li><li>When coding, only use a shared reference or state when <em>absolutely necessary</em>. (For example, instead of having several Global Singletons that everything can access whenever they want, only inject dependencies wherever needed and make nothing global/shared.)</li><li>Hopefully, with a simpler game design, focus more on unique graphics or sounds that I would normally never even try.</li></ul><p>My laptop is still too old and broken to make video games. So I&rsquo;m making this game on a temporary workaround that also isn&rsquo;t great, so I&rsquo;ll still have to be minimal in terms of assets, code complexity, project size, etcetera.</p><h2 id=the-first-approach>The first approach</h2><p>My first approach was as follows.</p><h3 id=player-movement>Player Movement</h3><p>This is nothing special. I reused my &ldquo;input manager&rdquo; script from previous games, which allows logging keyboard and gamepad players on/off. Each player has one module that reads/polls their own input, and one module that responds to it by moving over the grid.</p><p>While playing the animation ( = movement takes time, snapping into place looks bad), it ignores all input. The map checks that you don&rsquo;t go out of bounds or whatever. And when done, it fires a signal <code>cell_entered</code> that all those other modules react to.</p><h3 id=map>Map</h3><p>Every cell on the map is a scripted object that tracks three things.</p><ul><li>Which player(s) are on it</li><li>Which element it holds (potion, core element, or nothing)</li><li>Which machine it has (recipe book, garbage bin, etcetera, or nothing)</li></ul><p>I decided to call it a &ldquo;machine&rdquo; because it was short and worked for me. That variable simply means &ldquo;some object on the cell that <em>does something</em> and can&rsquo;t be picked up&rdquo;.</p><p>Normally, I&rsquo;d have a function like <code>interact_with_cell</code> or <code>check_cell</code> whenever a player enters a new cell. This would contain a (perhaps complicated) switch statement&mdash;or series of if-statements&mdash;that called the right code depending on the specific situation.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a garbage bin? Oh, do this. It&rsquo;s the recipe book? Oh, do that. Are there other players here? Oh, do this instead.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s ugly. And experience tells me that this seems fine at first but always gets out of hand as your game grows in complexity or you must handle unexpected corner cases.</p><p>So, instead, those <em>modules</em> are fully responsible for all interactions.</p><ul><li>The player has ~10 modules of 10&ndash;20 lines each. Whenever you enter a new cell, all of them check if they must do something. And if so, do it of course.</li><li>Sometimes, however, the cell also has custom logic or state. That&rsquo;s why, if there&rsquo;s a <em>machine</em> on it, the cell instantiates the right <em>module</em> for executing that machine too. (Which can then be accessed under the <code>machine</code> property of the cell.)</li></ul><p>It was a bit of a difficult structure to wrap my head around at first. In a sense, we&rsquo;ve now decoupled every &ldquo;complex interaction&rdquo; into two parts: a module on the player and a module on the cell. For example,</p><ul><li>The player has a <code>RecipeReader</code> that flips the recipe book to a new recipe if you walk over it.</li><li>The cell has a <code>RecipeBook</code> machine that actually tracks this, then responds and updates to display the right thing.</li></ul><p>So far, though, it leads to much cleaner code that&rsquo;s easier to maintain or scan.</p><h3 id=shadows>Shadows</h3><p>I decided to create one shadow script that handles it for all players, instead of giving each player their own shadow module.</p><ul><li>Any time someone changed position,</li><li>It loops through all cells in the grid</li><li>And checks if that cell is within range of any player&rsquo;s shadow</li><li>If so, hide its contents. Otherwise, show them.</li></ul><p>Why did I do this?</p><ul><li>Shadows might overlap. And if you check per player, then you&rsquo;re going to accidentally set them to the wrong value if someone <em>walks away</em> but the other player <em>stays within range</em>.<ul><li>You can prevent this by looping through the entire grid and resetting all values to <code>false</code> first, but that&rsquo;s more costly.</li><li>If shadows overlap, and we treat them as separate, then we&rsquo;ll also likely be re-calculating the same cell several times. Which is also more costly.</li></ul></li><li>Most of all, however, I wasn&rsquo;t sure where this mechanic would lead. Maybe I wanted to add some more twists to how these work. Maybe I wanted individualized shadows. By having one manager that does the entire shadow pass at once, it&rsquo;s more flexible and less prone to sneaky bugs.</li></ul><h3 id=general-game-loop>General Game Loop</h3><p>Normally in such games, the orders appear as some UI element at the top of the screen. Because I didn&rsquo;t want UI, I decided to simply turn certain cells (at the edge of the map) into &ldquo;order cells&rdquo;.</p><p>But even that&rsquo;s not enough. The player also wants to know when they win the level&mdash;how many customers can they expect, and how many have they already served? To do this without UI, I used the following rule.</p><blockquote><p>Every order cell can only be used once. After serving it, it disappears/changes appearance. This means that you always know how many you have left to go&mdash;and where customers can spawn&mdash;by checking the order cells that are left on the map.</p></blockquote><p>Similarly, the <em>timer</em> on the order is also displayed by turning the cell itself into a progress bar. (Instead of adding a separate UI element.)</p><h2 id=hows-that>How&rsquo;s that?</h2><p>All of this felt &mldr; fine? But, as usual, you start out by putting <em>too much stuff</em> in the game and then have to simplify.</p><p>I realized a few things.</p><ul><li>We can start the first level with only a single recipe. Moving around in the darkness, as you learn how the game actually works, is enough challenge.</li><li>The interaction between players on the same cell also isn&rsquo;t crucial at level 1.</li><li>We can even move the recipe book to a later level! By dissolving potions, you can figure out their recipe anyway.</li><li>I considered that it might be even simpler if you simply lose the game as soon as you try to deliver the wrong potion to a customer. (Instead of the extra step of adding a timer.) This, however, would remove the <em>only</em> aspect of the game that adds <em>urgency</em>! Without those timers, you can walk around extremely slowly and carefully, making almost no mistakes, which does not make it more fun.</li></ul><p>At this point, I desperately needed some simple sprites to see what the hell I&rsquo;m even doing. I also decided it was time to already craft the tutorial for the game. I like to do this early because it clearly highlights if it&rsquo;s simple enough or where it should be streamlined further. (And to make sure we don&rsquo;t forget at the end :p)</p><p>And so I did. I created most assets I&rsquo;d need&mdash;some already pretty and final, some just a crude sketch&mdash;and plugged them into the game.</p><p>This finally allowed me to play the game, missing only the inventory display. (So I couldn&rsquo;t actually see what was in my inventory, or what specific order somebody wanted.)</p><p>And by playing through the game, I stumbled upon a few major problems that stand in the way of an actual functioning game.</p><h2 id=the-second-attempt>The Second Attempt</h2><h3 id=major-problem-no-new-recipes-or-combinations>Major Problem: no &ldquo;new&rdquo; recipes or combinations</h3><p>Currently, the only way to get ingredients is by walking through a potion, which dissolves into its separate components. But &mldr; those potions are the <em>exact thing</em> that customers want. So, 90% of the time, walking through a potion and just collecting whatever comes out is <em>all you need to do</em>. Pretty boring, not much depth.</p><p>I see this as a major flaw at the <em>core</em> of the game. With the current setup, you never actually have to build something new from the components you get, and remembering where 2 or 3 ingredients are hidden isn&rsquo;t that hard.</p><p>How do we solve this?</p><ul><li>By forcing you to juggle more things at once.</li><li>By making the core action&mdash;movement/navigating with uncertainty&mdash;harder.</li><li>By rethinking the rules around recipes and ingredients to get more variety and creativity.</li></ul><p>I wrote down 15+ possible solutions. Some of them excluded the others, some could be used together.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned to simply implement all these rules tweaks or extra systems, but place them behind an easy debugging toggle so I can turn game mechanics on/off at a dime. This way, I can try all solutions, abandon those that don&rsquo;t work, without needing to copy-paste code, or comment out parts of it, or potentially ruin the other code from all the doing and undoing of ideas.</p><p>Some solutions were straightforward. For example: just place more garbage bins. This makes it much harder to navigate without accidentally losing what you have.</p><p>Some solutions were wacky or more complicated, but those are always the ones that feel most impactful and promising. For example: &ldquo;The longer/more something is in shadow, the more likely it is to <em>mutate</em> into something else.&rdquo; People change their orders, ingredients are suddenly something else, and you need to keep paying attention.</p><h3 id=so>So?</h3><p>I implemented all those ideas (and a few more). Most were fine, some were bad.</p><p>I kept the fine ones and sorted them based on complexity to get &ldquo;levels&rdquo; (where one new rule is introduced for each level). This sort is also simply based on variety and not overwhelming players.</p><p>Then I created the tutorial system that displays the image + text for this new rule, and modifies the required properties/numbers behind the scenes. (It&rsquo;s cumulative: the changes of the previous tutorial are kept, and the new one simply loads its own stuff on top of that.)</p><p>The <strong>biggest</strong> realization (to keep the game simple, but already interesting from level 1) was to simply <strong>make holes deadly</strong>.</p><ul><li>You can walk into them just fine.</li><li>But it will kill you.</li><li>And shadows hide these holes. (At the start/end of the game, all shadows are turned off, so you have a few seconds to see where everything is and what the map looks like.)</li></ul><p>This is very intuitive to most players. (Of course you die by falling into a pit, and a pit is just any place where there&rsquo;s no cell.)</p><p>At the same time, this makes the game much more challenging and tense in a good way. You have to memorize the locations of cells, and not&mdash;in your panic or haste&mdash;accidentally walk into one.</p><p>Now we finally had a core structure and progression to the game. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the game is any good: I need to playtest it myself and tweak loads of numbers.</p><h3 id=tweaking-for-fun>Tweaking for fun</h3><p>I made maps slightly smaller than I originally intended, and had my algorithm take bigger bites out of it. (Otherwise, holes would be so tiny you could almost ignore them, or they&rsquo;d only appear at the edges anyway.)</p><p>I made the timer (for making new customers appear, new potions/ingredients, etcetera) <em>much</em> faster.</p><p>I made movement a bit slower by default. Otherwise, moving too fast both makes the game too easy (you can get anywhere you want at an instant), and also too annoying (you&rsquo;re far more likely to accidentally run into a hole with such movement). Also to allow <em>speed up</em> powerups later to make sense.</p><p>I added <em>more orders</em> by default, right from the start. This increases the probability of being far away from an order, having to juggle multiple at the same time, and just felt like a better balance in terms of challenge.</p><p>Of course there was a lot more tweaking, but those were <em>tiny</em> changes to numbers or settings or whatever and not that interesting.</p><h2 id=polishing>Polishing</h2><p>The usual suspects: Sound, Animation/Tweens, Particles, and Graphics in general.</p><h3 id=sound>Sound</h3><p>The process was &mldr;</p><ul><li>Find royalty free sound effects (or create them myself, if I can)</li><li>Edit them <em>a lot</em>. (They always have wildly different volumes, lots of empty space at start/end, perhaps sections that I don&rsquo;t need, and they&rsquo;re almost always too SLOW.)</li><li>Plug them all into the game.</li></ul><p>My hardware is still too broken for any serious work on music or graphics. So I did all this in Audacity with quick destructive edits.</p><p>The soundtrack was done in Reaper with a mix of MIDI-input + a free Piano VST, recording my Egg Shakers with my laptop microphone, and using more royalty free sounds for subtle ambience and some sparkling here and there.</p><p>Then my computer was done with it and I decided to stop the arrangement there.</p><p>As usual, I am a musician, so inventing a catchy melody happens easily. Some ambient looping sounds, some chords or shakers, and a very simple arrangement can sound fine. The biggest issue is actually recording/transfering those issues when your hardware is working against you every step of the way.</p><p>No, wait, the biggest challenge was that <em>the home is being renovated</em>. I couldn&rsquo;t hear what the fudge I was doing. Volume balancing is hard enough as it is. (How loud should each sound be? How loud should game sounds be compared to background music? Sounds that repeat a lot should be much softer and a bit randomized, otherwise they&rsquo;re annoying. Single-instance sounds should be a bit louder than normal.) With drills and hammers all around you, this was a nightmare and I just gave it my best &ldquo;guess&rdquo; really.</p><h3 id=graphics>Graphics</h3><p>In my Game Design Document, I stated that I&rsquo;d get inspired by the visual style of <em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em>. And I did!</p><p>Because I still had to draw new stuff completely myself, of course, the style ended up deviating more and more and becoming its own thing. I think the game looks quite nice, unique and consistent.</p><p>I had to abandon any idea of glow/bloom, or lighting effects, or any more complexity. My own computer can&rsquo;t handle it, and if I can&rsquo;t make/play the game, then this all stops :p</p><p>In fact, the game just has 3 small spritesheets, as that&rsquo;s the maximum my computer could take.</p><ul><li>Elements => components, ingredients, machines</li><li>Misc => UI-stuff, player icons, any other &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; things (such as a blurry circle for both player shadows and particle effects)</li><li>Tutorials => a very tiny spritesheet with ~20 tutorial images for each level</li></ul><h3 id=animationstweensparticles>Animations/Tweens/Particles</h3><p>In Godot 4, tweens are a &ldquo;fire-and-forget&rdquo; thing, and that&rsquo;s one of the best improvements they ever did.</p><p>All throughout the game, it takes 10 seconds to write a simple tween (pop up, fade in-out, wiggle) to respond to certain elements. If that&rsquo;s impossible, the AnimationPlayer is equally simple and powerful.</p><p>I still have things that don&rsquo;t really react or are missing tweens, because I ran out of time. But I wrote them down on a &ldquo;future to-do list&rdquo;, just in case.</p><p>I do wish it was easier to animate Control/UI nodes in Godot. Now I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> restricted in how I can smoothly make those transition. (Such as when the Tutorial appears, I wanted a more splashy animation, but had to settle for a simple pop-up and fade-in-each-element-separately.) Still nice, not as nice as it could&rsquo;ve been.</p><p>Similarly, I have only a single particles scene: some fuzzy circles flying in different directions and fading away quickly (with lots of randomness). I re-use that when you do anything special, such as delivering an order.</p><p>It&rsquo;s always a few hours of &ldquo;boring work&rdquo;, if you ask me. But the results simply can&rsquo;t be ignored. For those few hours, the game feels much more like an actual game, more responsive and alive. In fact, after adding the sound for &ldquo;new customer arrived&rdquo;, I almost immediately shifted to exclusively relying on that recognizable bell when playtesting the game myself. That&rsquo;s how particles, feedback, and sound can also be incredibly useful/functional (despite being pretty or juicy).</p><h3 id=menus>Menus</h3><p>Especially in game jams, menus are barebones. I&rsquo;m fine with that. My marketing image for the game already helps the main menu a lot, just by looking more detailed and pretty as opposed to the buttons :p</p><p>I did spend some extra time on the input select screen. Both so that it&rsquo;s easy to use and clear, but also to prepare for future games.</p><p>I <em>want</em> to make more local multiplayer games again once I have a functioning computer. And to do so, I want a really strong input system that makes input selection and management easy. So I used this project to improve my own library and fix some things.</p><p>(For example, in previous games, controls are all <em>fixed</em>. I&rsquo;d create an image with WASD or the arrow keys and display that. This obviously isn&rsquo;t very flexible and stops working once I give a game reconfigurable controls&mdash;which is the next thing my input system should get, once I have time.)</p><p>In the end, I think the menus are <em>fine</em> and <em>functional</em>, but they could&rsquo;ve had more love too if I had time. (At the same time, the non-game parts of this game look better and more polished than in some other games of mine, on which I worked much longer xD)</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Because I wanted to finish my current project first, and I forgot about time zones, I really only had 4 days for this one. That&rsquo;s not a lot. Especially not when you actually want to push yourself to make a worthwhile game (even after the jam).</p><p>As such, once the game was finished &mldr; I actually realized the <em>better</em> ways to make it more fun. That&rsquo;s just how it goes. It takes time to try stuff, realize what your game is about, and finally get to the better ideas.</p><p>For example, remember how I told you that &ldquo;make holes kill you&rdquo; was a simple rule that finally made the game work? Well, now I realize I should&rsquo;ve obviously <em>expanded</em> on that idea. (Instead of introducing other rules or ideas all the time.)</p><ul><li>I could&rsquo;ve added tiles that break down over time. (Such as after walking over it X times, or being in shadow Y seconds.)</li><li>I could&rsquo;ve moved them around in some predictable way.</li><li>I could&rsquo;ve added powerups that gave more lives, or single-time protection against the holes, or a &ldquo;see holes even in shadow&rdquo;-bonus.</li><li>Etcetera</li></ul><p>The same thing with &ldquo;movement&rdquo;. The entire game is <em>movement</em> and how you go about it, so I should&rsquo;ve done more variation on it, right? Perhaps moving in Tetris patterns was needed to create ingredients. Perhaps something would allow you to <em>jump</em> over holes.</p><p>All great ideas that probably would&rsquo;ve been simpler to implement and created a better game. But that&rsquo;s how it goes. Only 4 days, jam is over, I have other work to do.</p><p>I wrote all that in a future to-do list. I&rsquo;ve actually become much better in recent years at coming back to projects (even after years) and giving them a great update in a few days. So maybe it will happen for this one too. There&rsquo;s a good core that <em>can</em> become more, but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel <em>so promising</em> that I&rsquo;m ditching everything else to continue work on this game.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>Also because my hardware is still crap, so it&rsquo;s not &mldr; very fun to work on games that aren&rsquo;t tiny anymore.</p></aside><p>That&rsquo;s it for this devlog! Very short, no images or videos really to show. But I think the final game is <em>okay</em>. More importantly, I created <em>something</em> and <em>send it</em> to the jam, and that&rsquo;s really the only goal here.</p><p>Keep playing,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/videogames/game-jams/finside-out-and-inside-sprout/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-5" style=--rotation:1.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/videogames/game-jams/bot-bouldering/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-5" style=--rotation:-1deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
