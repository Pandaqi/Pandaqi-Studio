local multiplayer games.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to create those kinds of games for several years now,
which means I&rsquo;ve hit every obstacle and roadblock imaginable.</p><p>In this article series I want to explain &mldr;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Why</strong> I created &ldquo;Pizza Peers&rdquo; (and the underlying system)</p></li><li><p><strong>How</strong> I created it (with some code, some nice images, and a bunch
of text)</p></li><li><p>And why I think it might be the best thing I ever made and will be
creating many more games like these.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to know more (including explanation of the game), visit the official game page: <a href=https://pandaqi.com/pizza-peers>Pizza Peers - Tasty Multiplayer Fun</a></p><p>If you want to play the game, simply visit the server in any browser: <a href=https://pizza-peers.herokuapp.com>Pizza Peers</a></p><p>If you&rsquo;re reading this as a programmer, you&rsquo;re in luck: I made the full
source code publicly available! (I even did my best to clean it up and
comment everything nicely.)</p><blockquote><p><a href=http://github.com/pandaqi/peer-to-peer>Pizza Peers on GitHub</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-problem-with-multiplayer>The problem with multiplayer</h2><p>I want to create local multiplayer experiences for the whole family. The
games must be accessible to all ages, to both gamers and non-gamers, and
most of all: cooperative multiplayer.</p><p>(Not always, of course. I make single player games and competitive
multiplayer. It&rsquo;s just that cooperative is the best choice for families
and non-gamers, because they don&rsquo;t tend to go well with competitive
environments &mldr;)</p><p><strong>First thing I ever tried</strong>: one person using the keyboard, one using
the mouse. As you might expect, this was a mess. (And didn&rsquo;t scale to
more than two players, obviously. Nobody is going to attach four mice
(mouses?) to their computer.)</p><p><strong>Second try</strong>: two people on the same keyboard. In fact, I even made
games for three and four people on the same keyboard. While this worked
and was kinda fun, it&rsquo;s just very cramped and doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> fun.
Pressing tiny buttons with letters on them is not an <em>intuitive</em> way to
control a game.</p><p><strong>Third try:</strong> controllers / joysticks / gamepads (however people want
to call them). Controllers feel the most fun and intuitive when playing
a game. The number of people with at least one controller is quite high
(in my experience), and this scales perfectly to higher player counts.</p><p>I really like playing with a controller, and so does everyone around me
(they are visibly having more fun if each of them gets their own
controller), so this seems like the perfect option.</p><p><em>However</em>, not everybody has a controller, and certainly not more than
two. Additionally, to non-gamers a controller feels &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;. They
immediately get the feeling that this game is going to be difficult and
that they won&rsquo;t understand it.</p><p>(Additionally, the setup can be draining. Having to connect all the
controllers to a system before getting to play a game, and having to
<em>explain</em> the buttons, costs a lot of time and energy. By the time the
setup is done, half the people have already lost motivation.)</p><p><strong>Fourth try:</strong> what if &mldr; we could use people&rsquo;s <em>smartphones</em> as the
controller?</p><p>I know about the <strong>Jackbox</strong> games, but those are mostly (social)
turn-based games.</p><p>I know about <strong>AirConsole</strong>, but that service uses a server that
introduces noticeable delays, and the games on there are &ndash; in my
probably worthless opinion &ndash; not that exciting or accessible. (Plus, it
costs money. That&rsquo;s not a criticism: it&rsquo;s fair to ask money for such a
service. It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t personally have the money to spend.)</p><p>Instead, I remembered an old technique that now seems long forgotten in
the gaming world: <strong>peer to peer</strong>. (I&rsquo;ll explain this more in the third
article.)</p><p>If you are playing on the same Wi-Fi network, using a peer-to-peer
connection is <strong>as good as instant</strong>. And indeed, in all the games I&rsquo;ve
played using my system, everyone immediately forgets that they&rsquo;re
playing over the internet because everything happens as if you were
holding a controller.</p><p>Suddenly, everyone with a smartphone can join the game within 5-10
seconds! Most people <em>have</em> a smartphone and <em>understand</em> how it works,
which means these games are not intimidating and do not require you to
buy loads of controllers.</p><h2 id=so-what-is-pizza-peers>So, what <em>is</em> &ldquo;Pizza Peers&rdquo;?</h2><p>That&rsquo;s what Pizza Peers is: <strong>a cooperative multiplayer game in the web
browser, where everyone can use their smartphone as the controller</strong>.</p><p>More specifically, you&rsquo;ll be running a pizza place and trying to prepare
and deliver pizzas throughout the city.</p><p>To start the game, all you need to do is visit
<strong><a href=https://pizza-peers.herokuapp.com>https://pizza-peers.herokuapp.com</a></strong> on a computer. Press the &ldquo;create
game&rdquo; button.</p><p>Now, everyone can whip out their smartphone and visit the same address
in their browser. They simply enter the <em>room code</em> (displayed on
screen) and a <em>fun username</em>, and then click &ldquo;join game&rdquo;.</p><p>It only takes 5-10 seconds to fully create and load the game. It also
only takes 5-10 seconds for players to connect (which they can do
simultaneously, by the way). No need to download or install anything, no
delays, you&rsquo;re playing in no-time.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how important this is. With my previous games, I&rsquo;d
need to ask, &ldquo;do you want to try my game?&rdquo;, and if they said yes, it
would take a good 10-15 minutes to setup everything and get everyone
ready.</p><p>Now I can ask that question, point everyone to the web address, and
within a minute we&rsquo;re already playing. Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve already
playtested this game more often than many of my other games.</p><p><strong>Remark:</strong> in hindsight, though, I probably should have started with a
simpler game. Pizza Peers is essentially a slightly different and
watered-down version of the game Overcooked. Trying to create a
fully-fledged game on your first peer-to-peer try isn&rsquo;t ideal. I should
have made multiplayer pong or something, or multiplayer flappy bird
(however that might work), but oh well.</p><h2 id=why-i-wrote-this-article-series>Why I wrote this article series</h2><p>I would <em>love</em> to see a world with more games like this. Games you can
play with anyone, games that are extremely easy to start and access,
cooperative multiplayer with everyone being in the same room.</p><p>(Sure, you can also play remotely if the host screenshares his computer.
But that will introduce delays and probably not make the game more fun.)</p><p>I&rsquo;m sharing this project, my source code, and my ideas behind it to show
people what is possible and to hopefully help other game developers.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s not that hard.</strong> Seriously, the code for connecting people and
sending signals through peer-to-peer is only a few hundred lines. (Which
includes error handling, comments, lots of whitespace because I like
whitespace, etcetera.)</p><p>Additionally, I haven&rsquo;t found anyone else talk about this or share these
kinds of ideas. I might be the first one to do this, although I highly
doubt that.</p><p><strong>It opens a whole new world of possibilities.</strong></p><p>A smartphone, for example, is not static (like a controller). You can
<em>change</em> the interface during the game, you can send chat messages, you
can shake the phone to do something in-game, you can even livestream
everyone&rsquo;s camera to the screen if you want. (Not sure how you&rsquo;d use
that in a game, but you <em>can</em>!)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tested this game on a nearly 10-year old iMac (as the host) and my
own 5-year old smartphone (which was the cheapest available at the
time). Surely everyone must be able to play these kinds of games :p</p><p>So, let&rsquo;s get started! Topics like web sockets and Node.js servers, what
an exciting time!</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><span class=nav-disabled>No previous page :(</span></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/videogames/the-peerful-project/pizza-peers/devlog-pizza-peers/2-websockets-node-js-server/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-2" style=--rotation:2deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
