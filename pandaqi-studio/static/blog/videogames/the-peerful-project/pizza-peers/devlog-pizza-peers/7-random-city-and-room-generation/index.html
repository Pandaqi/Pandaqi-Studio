Go to the <a href=../>devlog overview</a>.</p><p>This is what the average city in the game &ldquo;Pizza Peers&rdquo; looks like:</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=pizza-peers-1.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Random city generation in Pizza Peers" title="Random city generation in Pizza Peers" width=1909 height=898></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Random city generation in Pizza Peers</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>There are ingredient locations, lots of regular buildings, and roads
that logically (and efficiently) connect them.</p><p>On top of that, there are three kitchens (or &ldquo;workspaces&rdquo;) which must
contain X amount of tables and ovens, and which must be walkable. (If
you can&rsquo;t go inside the kitchens or reach any of the tables/ovens, they
are worthless and the game becomes impossible.)</p><p>Today I want to share how I generate these elements.</p><p>(When expressed in code, these algorithms are quite heavy, which is why
I&rsquo;m not sharing any code. Check the source code if you want to see the
exact implementation.)</p><h2 id=extend-road>&ldquo;Extend Road&rdquo;</h2><p>All the algorithms are powered by the the &ldquo;extend road&rdquo; algorithm.</p><p>It does the following:</p><ul><li><p>We&rsquo;ve just placed something at grid location (x,y)</p></li><li><p>Check if we are already connected with a road.</p></li><li><p>If not, pick a random side (that is available)</p></li><li><p>Now continue this road in a straight line until you are &mldr;</p><ul><li><p>Adjacent to an existing road;</p></li><li><p>Or you&rsquo;ve reached the edge of the map</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s an image for extra clarity:</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=pizza-peers-2.png loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The &ldquo;extend road&rdquo; algorithm, visually" title="The &ldquo;extend road&rdquo; algorithm, visually" width=480 height=400></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>The &ldquo;extend road&rdquo; algorithm, visually</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>The first few things we place will get a road leading to the edge of the
map. Those automatically become the &ldquo;main streets&rdquo; of the city.</p><p>All subsequently placed buildings will create a road connecting to one
of the existing roads, which leads to a mostly realistic and
good-looking road network. (It&rsquo;s not perfect, of course, but I chose
simplicity over complexity for this game.)</p><p>Because of the grid structure, once an <em>adjacent cell</em> is already a
road, we are automatically connected to a road. Because this adjacent
cell could be anywhere (left/right/top/bottom) we automatically get
corners and curves in the road for free!</p><p>(Additionally, the road is as short as possible, and we don&rsquo;t get ugly
rectangles with multiple parallel roads.)</p><h2 id=kitchens>Kitchens</h2><p>As expressed in the introduction, kitchens have one important property:
<strong>you need to be able to walk from one entrance to another</strong>. No
tables/walls may block your way. Instead, they must be to the side of
the path, so you can easily reach them.</p><p>See the screenshot below for how this looks in practice. The dark red floor (with beige walls around it) marks a kitchen. Openings in the walls are entrances to the kitchen, and the purple things are tables/ovens.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=pizza-peers-3.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Kitchen/workspace generation in Pizza Peers" title="Kitchen/workspace generation in Pizza Peers" width=1913 height=908></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Kitchen/workspace generation in Pizza Peers</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>Whenever you encounter such a problem, it&rsquo;s usually wise to take the
reverse approach. Don&rsquo;t build a kitchen and then check if it&rsquo;s walkable.
Build a path and then model the kitchen around it.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=pizza-peers-4.png loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Kitchen algorithm, visually" title="Kitchen algorithm, visually" width=770 height=175></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Kitchen algorithm, visually</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> create a random path, starting from a random location (x,y)</p><blockquote><p>For this, I used the random path algorithm expressed here:
<a href=https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/162915/creating-random-path-in-grid>https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/162915/creating-random-path-in-grid</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> use &ldquo;extend road&rdquo; on the start and end point.</p><blockquote><p>This ensure we have two openings, which are reachable and connected to
a road.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> randomly overlay the path with rectangles</p><blockquote><p>Pick any cell from the random path. Now draw a rectangle around it of
random size (2x2, 2x3, 3x2, &mldr;) Mark all those cells as part of the
kitchen. Continue until the kitchen is large enough (cells.length >
someNumber).</p></blockquote><p><strong>(Step 4:</strong> loop through the cells and place walls whenever an edge is
connected with the outside world.)</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> pick random cells within the kitchen, <em>excluding those from
the random path</em>. Place tables and ovens there.</p><p>The random location (x,y) of the kitchen can be anywhere, although I
made sure it had at least distance 10 to another kitchen, and distance 3
to the edge.</p><h2 id=buildings>Buildings</h2><p>Knowing the previous algorithm, placing buildings is trivial:</p><ul><li><p>Place building (regular buildings can be anywhere, ingredient
buildings are spaced apart as much as possible)</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Extend road&rdquo;</p></li></ul><p>&mldr; that&rsquo;s it. As I said: the &ldquo;extend road&rdquo; algorithm does a wonderful
job jelling these na√Øve algorithms together.</p><h2 id=pixel-art>Pixel Art</h2><p>In an effort to keep this game simple, I imposed a harsh restriction on
myself: all sprites had to be 8x8 pixels. That&rsquo;s not a lot of room. This is the complete spritesheet for all possible ingredients and pizza combinations:</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=pizza-peers-5.png loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Spritesheet for all pizzas and combos" title="Spritesheet for all pizzas and combos" width=256 height=8></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Spritesheet for all pizzas and combos</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>(For those paying attention: yes, I decided to index combinations using binary numbers. For example, 20 = 10100 means a pizza has ingredient 1 and 3, and none of the others.)</p><p>As it turns out, buildings aren&rsquo;t square, so this requirement changed to
8x11 along the way. Here&rsquo;s the whole 8x11 spritesheet:</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=pizza-peers-6.png loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Buildings 8x11 spritesheet" title="Buildings 8x11 spritesheet" width=360 height=11></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Buildings 8x11 spritesheet</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>I must say that this restriction was a blessing. It allowed me to very
quickly make art for the game, keeping everything simple and clean. At
the same time, I think the game looks quite cute and fun, even though I
only had very few pixels for every element.</p><p>(Some elements are more detailed, such as characters and vehicles. They
are 16x16. But most are 8x8 or 8x11.)</p><p>Using pixel art also makes animating much easier. In most cases, it&rsquo;s a
matter of smartly displacing some pixels or shifting colors, then
playing a spritesheet animation. It&rsquo;s a simple thing, but making
everything <em>move</em> and <em>respond to input</em> makes a game feel much more
alive.</p><p>It&rsquo;s my first attempt at pixel art, but I like it so much that all
subsequent peer-to-peer games might just be using this art style &mldr;</p><p>(Yeah, yeah, I know this game isn&rsquo;t exactly a prime example of
gorgeousness. I&rsquo;m just trying to explain why I like pixel art and why I
think some parts helped the game a lot.)</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>It may sound very simple now, but it took me a long time to find such
elegant approaches and implement them (without entering infinite loops
or creating awkwardly shaped kitchens).</p><p>The kitchen algorithm was already my third try. (At which point, I must
admit, my positive state of mind was quickly deteriorating.)</p><p>However, I think this does provide a wonderful introduction to
procedural generation to anyone wanting to learn about that topic. Using
something as simple as these building blocks can already get you very
far.</p><p>I think that&rsquo;s all I want to say about this game.</p><p>Play it! Have fun together! Introduce your (grand)parents or your kids!</p><p>Hopefully you learnt something from this article series, and hopefully I
am able to play <em>your</em> cool peer-to-peer multiplayer game soon.</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/videogames/the-peerful-project/pizza-peers/devlog-pizza-peers/6-problems-with-p2p/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-8" style=--rotation:-1deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><span class=nav-disabled>No next page :(</span></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
