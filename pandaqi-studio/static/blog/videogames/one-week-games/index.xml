Allowed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Previously called &lt;strong&gt;Splitball&lt;/strong&gt; in my notes. Then it was called &amp;ldquo;No Own
Goals Allowed&amp;rdquo;, but the combination of &lt;em&gt;No Own&lt;/em&gt; is just hard to read and
pronounce.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Carving Pumpkins &amp; Dwarfing Dumplings</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-carving-pumpkins-and-dwarfing-dumplings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-carving-pumpkins-and-dwarfing-dumplings/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the devlog for my game &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/carving-pumpkins-and-dwarfing-dumplings"&gt;Carving Pumpkins &amp;amp; Dwarfing
Dumplings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to keep this one shorter than usual, as this game is
basically a spinoff from another game I was making. (It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/rolling-in-the-sheepe"&gt;Rolling in the Sheepe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rolling in the Sheepe</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-rolling-in-the-sheepe/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-rolling-in-the-sheepe/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my &lt;strong&gt;devlog&lt;/strong&gt; for the game &amp;ldquo;Sheepe&amp;rdquo;, otherwise known as
&lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/rolling-in-the-sheepe/"&gt;Rolling in the Sheepe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was simple: everyone is a sheep in a &lt;strong&gt;random shape&lt;/strong&gt;, you can
only &lt;strong&gt;roll yourself&lt;/strong&gt;, and the first to reach the finish wins.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Totems of Tag</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-totems-of-tag/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-totems-of-tag/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another devlog about a &amp;ldquo;One Week Game&amp;rdquo;! (Which are,
unsurprisingly, games completely developed in a single week.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Wish You Good Hug</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-i-wish-you-good-hug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-i-wish-you-good-hug/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my &amp;ldquo;devlog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What I&amp;rsquo;ve Learned&amp;rdquo; for my latest game: &lt;em&gt;Huggy
Bastard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Play Store doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it when you use the word &amp;ldquo;bastard&amp;rdquo;
in kid-friendly games, I decided to change the name to &lt;em&gt;I Wish You Good
Hug&lt;/em&gt; on most platforms/websites. But the original project title was a silly pun on Lucky Bastard, just so
you know.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Recipe For Disaster</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-a-recipe-for-disaster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-a-recipe-for-disaster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I created &lt;em&gt;A Recipe For Disaster&lt;/em&gt;. A couch co-op game for 1-4
players, for literally all ages and skill levels, about running a
bakery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
