As expected, it&rsquo;s a spin-off for my game <a href=https://pandaqi.com/photomone>Photomone</a>.</p><p>While developing that game, I invented some &ldquo;expansions&rdquo;, that quickly turned into completely separate ideas that should just be separate games. This was the second of those.</p><p>It&rsquo;s &mldr; not really a board game anymore. Because there is no board, no physical material. But it&rsquo;s based on a board game (<em>Photomone</em>, remember?) and was meant as a &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; version of it, playable with just one tablet or smartphone.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>For Photomone, I made an interactive tool. When you load the website, you instantly get a word and a canvas (with points), so you can immediately learn/try the game. Try to draw the word on that canvas!</p><p>It works great. It&rsquo;s a cool (interactive) marketing <em>and</em> teaching tool.</p><p>So I thought: why not turn that into a full game? I already have most of the code and setup. What if you play Photomone on just one device (both drawing and receiving your words)?</p><p>There is, however, one clear issue: <strong>a phone is much smaller than a printed paper</strong> (and, of course, everyone has different screen sizes)</p><p>Oh, and another clear issue: <strong>nobody reads rules for a digital game</strong></p><p>The game had to be simplified.</p><ul><li>With less space, words need to be simpler <em>and</em> the game needs to be over quicker.</li><li>Any extra rules (such as special locations or expansions) had to be discarded completely. (The only special things I can add, are those that can be completely <em>automated</em> by the system itself. So players don&rsquo;t need to read or learn any rules.)</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s also look on the bright side, at some advantages!</p><ul><li>Because it&rsquo;s digital, I can erase/clear the canvas easily! So we can make a game longer (or just more unique) by allowing this to happen.</li><li>The interface can track everything: score, turns, and a <em>timer</em> to ensure turns don&rsquo;t take too long.</li></ul><p>But that&rsquo;s really all there is. <em>Photomone: Digital Antists</em> should just be a game you can &mldr;</p><ul><li>Rapidly fire up on any phone</li><li>Play in 15-30 minutes</li><li>As you take turns picking a secret word (on the phone), then drawing and guessing it (with a timer running)</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s it. Let&rsquo;s make that.</p><h2 id=lifting-my-previous-work>Lifting my previous work</h2><p>As mentioned, I already created the drawable canvas <em>and</em> the random words interface (for the original Photomone).</p><p>I just had to generalize those systems and &ldquo;extract&rdquo; that code from the original game. So I could re-use it here just by calling it.</p><p>Both these systems are wrapped inside a bigger piece of code that manages the flow of the game. (Tracking turns, making sure the right screens/buttons appear at the right time, and so forth.)</p><p>This is &mldr; honestly just busywork. There&rsquo;s not much challenge or difficulty to the code, I just have to &ldquo;do it&rdquo;. Create all the HTML, the buttons, attach the JavaScript, make sure all systems are connected (and fail properly if something fails).</p><p>I usually procrastinate on these things until one evening I&rsquo;m like: &ldquo;dang it, let&rsquo;s focus for 3 hours and pump out this system&rdquo;</p><p>There was one requirement on which I wouldn&rsquo;t budge: the canvas had to be entirely full screen. We really need that space on (small) smartphones. It looks and plays much better.</p><p>So, the interface should <em>overlay</em> the canvas, instead of taking up empty space. And it should only show what&rsquo;s <em>absolutely necessary</em> while drawing. That is &mldr;</p><ul><li>How many lines you have (left)</li><li>The timer</li></ul><p>Even then, I wanted to conserve space. How could I do that?</p><ul><li>Count lines as you draw. Whenever you add a new line, it adds a number to the line (line 1, line 2, line 3, &mldr;) + repeats how many you have <em>left</em>. This could be a quick pop-up effect, or the number could be big and in the whole <em>background</em>.</li><li>The same for the timer. Don&rsquo;t use precious space to display numbers or text. Instead, I&rsquo;ll simply add a bar at the top that slowly shrinks and changes color. You can <em>tap</em> that bar to stop the timer, which means the word has been guessed correctly and the turn is over.</li></ul><p>Any other information is only shown <em>between turns</em>. (Such as your total score or how many turns are left.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=photomone_digital_draw_phase.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Image of the drawing phase, with highly simplified interface." title="Image of the drawing phase, with highly simplified interface." width=1277 height=928></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Image of the drawing phase, with highly simplified interface.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=photomone_digital_draw_phase_active.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Image of the drawing phase, after drawing some lines and doing stuff." title="Image of the drawing phase, after drawing some lines and doing stuff." width=1275 height=927></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Image of the drawing phase, after drawing some lines and doing stuff.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=creating-the-tutorial>Creating the tutorial</h2><p>It&rsquo;s a digital game, so there is no rulebook. Instead, the game has to teach itself. Fortunately, this game is very simple. I can do this via prompts <em>as you play</em> (the first few rounds).</p><ul><li>When you boot the game, it says: &ldquo;Your goal is to score X points (or more) in Y turns. Give the phone to the first player. Make sure nobody else can see the screen!&rdquo;</li><li>When you start the first turn, it says: &ldquo;Pick one of these words. ICON1 says how many lines you may draw. ICON2 says how much food you score if the word is guessed.&rdquo;</li><li>When you start drawing, it says: &ldquo;Draw lines between points to communicate your word. The others guess it! If correct, tap the timer bar. If the timer runs out, you&rsquo;ve lost this round and score no points.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>On the main page, there&rsquo;s a (small) settings box for starting the game. You can disable this tutorial there, if you already know the game. Similarly, that&rsquo;s where you choose the difficulty of words, the length of the game, any expansions, etcetera.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=photomone_digital_tutorial.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Image of the tutorial interface" title="Image of the tutorial interface" width=1277 height=934></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Image of the tutorial interface</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=photomone_digital_word_pick.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Image of the word picking interface beneath it, once you clicked away the tutorial" title="Image of the word picking interface beneath it, once you clicked away the tutorial" width=1276 height=932></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Image of the word picking interface beneath it, once you clicked away the tutorial</span></figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=adding-depth>Adding depth</h2><p>This is a fine game. That&rsquo;s why I chose this idea: the core concept is simple and solid, which means it should even be very replayable on its own.</p><p>You know me, however, and I want to put a bit more work into it. I want to add special locations again. But not just the exact same list as the original Photomone.</p><ul><li>Some of them don&rsquo;t make sense for this game.</li><li>Some need too much explanation</li><li>Some can&rsquo;t be executed by a <em>computer</em>, or not as easily.</li></ul><p>Instead, I want a small list of cool powerups that can be &mldr;</p><ul><li>Immediately understood</li><li>Completely executed by the website (no effort for players)</li></ul><p>After some thought, I realized that the special locations from the base game of Photomone (no expansions) fit perfectly <em>for the most part</em>. So I copied those and taught the computer how they work. Besides that, I added some powerups for very intuitive and easy functionality.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Num Lines&rdquo;: changes your number of lines.</li><li>&ldquo;Food&rdquo;: changes how much food you score.</li><li>&ldquo;Timer&rdquo;: changes the length of your timer.</li><li>&ldquo;Distance&rdquo;: once triggered, you can&rsquo;t use dots too far away from the others</li><li>&ldquo;Repel&rdquo;: once triggered, you can&rsquo;t use dots that have already been used</li><li>&ldquo;Fixed&rdquo;: once triggered, you can&rsquo;t lift your finger anymore</li><li>&ldquo;Poison Trail&rdquo;: once triggered, you can&rsquo;t cross through other lines anymore.</li><li>&ldquo;Eraser&rdquo;: clears the whole board!</li><li>&ldquo;Magiciant&rdquo;: regenerates the board (so the locations and types of cells change)</li><li>&ldquo;Wolverine&rdquo;: all points you used are <em>removed</em> from the map (once your turn is over)</li><li>&ldquo;Wordeater&rdquo;: next turn, the player has only two words to choose from</li><li>&ldquo;Foodloose&rdquo;: changes your target score (for the whole game) by the number shown.</li></ul><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>The Poison Trail effect was <em>surprisingly tough</em> to implement. I had to research the calculations for checking if two line segments intersect, incorporate that with the current system, and make it both <em>fast</em> and <em>precise</em>. For example, two lines technically also intersect if they use the same point, because they both start at the exact center of that point. So I had to introduce a smart &ldquo;offset&rdquo; / &ldquo;margin of error&rdquo; to prevent the algorithm detecting EVERYTHING as lines intersecting.</p></aside><p>This is a lot to teach. I&rsquo;ve had this problem in digital games before and found a most elegant solution long ago.</p><ul><li>You don&rsquo;t allow all types. You pick a small set (say, 3 or 5) at the start. You explain only <em>those</em> at the start.</li><li>You place those icons in some easy to reach location, so players can always tap them to remember what they meant.</li><li>(In this game, I can even check for taps on the actual location, and explain it again with a pop-up.)</li></ul><p>Because you&rsquo;ve reduced the set, you <em>can</em> explain them all (without overwhelming people), and as they play more rounds, they quickly get very familiar with those 3 powerups.</p><p>Unless your game is very deep and takes 2 hours to play, this reduction of possibilities is no issue. After 20 minutes, the game is over, and players can restart to get other powerups. Statistically speaking, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely you encounter <em>all</em> possible powerups in a game anyway.</p><p>In the end, I decided to remove any UI for this, and make it entirely interactive. While playing, you can always tap a special point to get its explanation.</p><ul><li>First of all, because that is just the most efficient and useful way to do it. People want to know what a point does <em>when they encounter it on their turn</em>, not before or after.</li><li>Secondly, because I didn&rsquo;t have space for more UI elements. The game now fits neatly on a mobile screen (with no or minimal scrolling ever needed) and looks clean&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want to introduce even more icons/buttons.</li></ul><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=photomone_digital_powerup_hints.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Image of the powerup hints, a simple overlay you can toggle on top of the canvas" title="Image of the powerup hints, a simple overlay you can toggle on top of the canvas" width=1281 height=924></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Image of the powerup hints, a simple overlay you can toggle on top of the canvas</span></figcaption></figure></p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>Also, this means that the main page for this game is very short and simple. It doesn&rsquo;t explain anything. There is no rulebook, no overview of all powerups, nothing. Because it&rsquo;s not needed.</p></aside><h2 id=playtest>Playtest</h2><p>Pfew, I forgot how little you have to do for a web video game, especially when compared to a <em>board</em> game. No rulebook to create, no material, and I already <em>had</em> most of the code.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s already time to playtest.</p><p>Here you see the reason why I really wanted to make this variation on the game: it&rsquo;s just so <em>easy</em> to play. I can ask anyone &ldquo;hey, do you have 15 minutes?&rdquo;, pull out my phone, and we&rsquo;re playing this game. The controls are literally <em>drawing with your finger</em> (or, even better, it&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo;). Anything else is handled by the website, and nothing needs explaining beforehand.</p><p>What did we learn from the playtest?</p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just Photomone &mldr; now using a phone xD It is <em>very</em> quick to play. (And lose&mdash;once you carelessly start playing with harder words.)</p><p>Only some minor notes:</p><ul><li>Timer bar at the top can be slightly thicker, otherwise easy to misclick (especially when running out and in a panic)</li><li>It didn&rsquo;t register the &ldquo;Sneaky Spots&rdquo; expansion correctly. (It <em>always</em> enabled it.) => Additionally, yes, I actually do want to explain the powerups included on the welcome screen.</li><li>The number of points could be slightly lower. Maybe I can detect screen size and lower it dynamically, if needed.</li><li>New players are sometimes confused when something doesn&rsquo;t work (because a powerup/special dot they used forbids it). Add feedback for that. (Just simple pop-ups at the bottom stating why you can&rsquo;t do what you tried to do.)</li></ul><p>The biggest issue is with the final round. If you performed terribly during the game, you have <em>no shot</em> at winning at the end. You need 10+ points and only have one turn left. Literally impossible! So why play? What&rsquo;s the point?</p><p>That&rsquo;s not a minor issue&mdash;that&rsquo;s something that <em>must</em> be fixed. A common way to do so, is by making that final round &ldquo;special&rdquo; in obvious ways: bigger scores, a change to the rules, whatever is needed to make the game <em>winnable</em>. That&rsquo;s usually a lot of fun and make a game <em>better</em>, instead of feeling like cheating.</p><p>For this game, that means &mldr;</p><ul><li>Scores are multiplied as often as needed to make the game &ldquo;winnable&rdquo;. (You need 10 more points? This word used to score only 4 points, but multiply it by 3 and you get 12 points. Enough to win!)</li><li>The timer is also increased by that amount. (Default is 45 seconds, so it&rsquo;d become 135 seconds = just over two minutes.)</li><li>However, the number of lines is <em>divided</em> by that same amount! (The word had 20 lines before? Now it has 20 / 3 = 7 (rounded).)</li></ul><p>This leads to frantic last rounds as you try to draw a princess with only 5 lines, and the other players yell hundreds of suggestions for two minutes :p</p><p>The perfect fix, in my eyes.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The lack of physical material <em>does</em> mean I can&rsquo;t show you photos of the game being played on a table. (Which I usually do, especially for One Paper Games, where I can photograph the final papers.) Oh well.</p><p>This game turned out exactly like I wanted. It <em>is</em> Photomone, but completely digital, even simpler and even faster. The interface works well. It all came together rather quickly, and with the small rule tweaks I explained above, the game became solid and balanced.</p><p>That&rsquo;s it for this devlog.</p><p>Until the next one,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/photomone/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-6" style=--rotation:-1.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/photomone-antsassins/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-4" style=--rotation:0deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
