Just a bunch of cute sheep in an expanding world of fenced-off meadows.</p><p>At the time, I was <em>extremely</em> busy, which meant it took a whole week before I could even <em>write down</em> the idea. That turned out to be a good thing, as it allowed my brain to keep thinking about it and basically create the whole game in my head before I did the first prototype.</p><p>When I cut out some paper tiles to test the game against myself, I already had the whole ruleset.</p><ul><li>Players get 4 tiles of their unique Sheeple, and 4 random tiles at the start.</li><li>On your turn, you either PLAY or CHANGE.</li><li>PLAY: Add a tile from your hand to the board.<ul><li>You can&rsquo;t place one in a meadow that already has another player&rsquo;s Sheeple.</li></ul></li><li>CHANGE: Pay 2 tiles to <strong>rotate</strong> an existing tile.<ul><li>Of course, rotating a tile might connect two meadows that were previously unconnected! (A <strong>conflict</strong>!) In that case, the <em>bigger</em> meadow wins. All Sheeple from the &ldquo;losing meadow&rdquo; are removed.</li></ul></li><li>The game continues until all players have no more tiles. For each Sheeple in an enclosed meadow, you score the <em>size</em> of that meadow as points.</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the whole game, and as usual, it <em>sounded</em> like it would work great in my head.</p><p>Then I tested it.</p><h2 id=prototype-lessons>Prototype Lessons</h2><p>Okay, yes, it <em>did</em> work for the most part. Below is an image (from my phone) of the first test game against myself.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=meadowmight_paper_prototype.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="This is what you get when you try to VERY QUICKLY sketch a boatload of sheep on tiny tiles." title="This is what you get when you try to VERY QUICKLY sketch a boatload of sheep on tiny tiles." width=1280 height=960></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>This is what you get when you try to VERY QUICKLY sketch a boatload of sheep on tiny tiles.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>But here&rsquo;s what I learned.</p><h3 id=rotation>Rotation</h3><p><strong>Rotating was too expensive.</strong> Paying 1 tile was more balanced. Even so, being able to rotate <em>anything</em> at <em>any time</em> was a bit too powerful.</p><p><strong>We need sensible limits on rotation.</strong> In the end, the following two ideas worked the best.</p><ul><li>You can&rsquo;t rotate a tile that has a double fence on any side. (Example: it shows a fence on the right, and the right neighbor shows a fence on the left. Hence, two fences next to each other.)</li><li>You can&rsquo;t do the CHANGE action anymore as soon as a player runs out of tiles. (Because they&rsquo;d be defenseless and you can take turn after turn ruining all their effort for their whole game.)</li></ul><p>The &ldquo;double fence&rdquo; idea actually came from a different idea I had. Something about sheep being able to jump over a <em>single fence</em> but not over a <em>double fence</em>. That idea was a bit vague, but while testing I repurposed it to what you see above, and it was a great way to limit the rotation action.</p><p>If you identify a tile as &ldquo;crucial&rdquo; to your game, you can try to play something besides it to get that double fence, creating some future safety for yourself.</p><h3 id=tile-types>Tile Types</h3><p><strong>All tile types seem equally valuable.</strong> When creating the prototype, I simply created equally many tiles of each configuration.</p><ul><li>No fences</li><li>1 Fence</li><li>2 Fences: on opposite sides, or creating an &ldquo;L&rdquo;</li><li>3 Fences</li><li>4 Fences</li></ul><p>I was afraid that something like &ldquo;3 Fences&rdquo; would be too restrictive and the least useful, but that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be true.</p><ul><li>The 0 fence obviously expands your meadow without adding any restrictions, which is very free but also adds the danger of never fully enclosing (and thus never scoring points).</li><li>The 1 and 2 fence are great for expanding a meadow while closing off some parts &mldr; but <em>also</em> most susceptible to a rotation attack.</li><li>The 3 fences are very restrictive &mldr; but <em>less susceptible</em> to a rotation attack. (Because most rotations will just be the same, as there are 3 fences.)</li><li>The 4 fences are a great way to instantly close off many sides, and otherwise a great tile to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for doing a rotation.</li></ul><p><strong>We need some neutral sheep.</strong> Only once I started making the paper prototype, did I realize that I completely forgot that there should probably be something on the tiles <strong>besides</strong> fences.</p><p>In the end, I created a 50/50 split.</p><ul><li>Half the tiles were just empty (= a patch of grass).</li><li>Half had a (neutral) sheep.</li></ul><p>When scoring, each sheep in your meadow would score +1 point.</p><p>I actually played both with and without this rule, and adding the neutral sheep was clearly more interesting and more balanced. (You could be stuck with a small meadow, but still make it worth more by collecting a lot of sheep inside.)</p><h3 id=how-to-resolve-conflict>How to resolve conflict?</h3><p>First of all, I quickly realized you can connect two meadows during the PLAY action as well. Of course you can! Don&rsquo;t know how I missed this, but you can obviously play a tile in a gap and therefore connect parts of the board that were previously unconnected.</p><p>But now came the biggest question: how to resolve the conflict when connecting two meadows?</p><p>My first try said that the Sheeple you removed just returned to the owner&rsquo;s hands. This, however, turned what <em>should</em> be a penalty into something that&rsquo;s actually helpful. (You get your Sheeple back! Now you can use them in a better way!)</p><p>Additionally, this left <strong>holes</strong> in the meadow. (My second attempt, just <em>discarding</em> the losing Sheeple, didn&rsquo;t solve that one either.)</p><p>My third attempt finally worked.</p><ul><li>The losing Sheeple are simply turned <strong>facedown</strong>. They should be considered as &ldquo;fences on all sides&rdquo;. (In other words, you don&rsquo;t create holes anymore, though your meadow <em>can</em> change in good or bad ways after winning a conflict.)</li><li>But when PLAYING a tile, you may also play <strong>on top of a facedown tile</strong>.</li></ul><p>This combination of two simple rules was by far the best.</p><ul><li>Losing a conflict means losing important Sheeple, so you <em>really</em> want to avoid that.</li><li>Winning a conflict isn&rsquo;t overpowered, as you&rsquo;re still left with some gaps or changes to your meadow.</li><li>And players can still strategically plug those gaps in a way that helps them (or severely hinders the player who just scored a big meadow).</li></ul><p>In practice,</p><ul><li>Conflicts are easy and quick to resolve.</li><li>The board remains easy to read.</li><li>The balance between risk and reward seems about right. (In all my test games, players on average did 4 rotation actions over the whole game. It&rsquo;s not so overpowered that you do it all the time, nor so difficult that you won&rsquo;t bother with it.)</li><li>And the number of gaps or stacks never grows very large. (In all my test games, it only happened once that a tile had a stack of <em>three</em>: lost a conflict twice, played a tile on top twice.)</li></ul><p>The number of tiles for my test game (64 = what you can get out of folding a paper several times) also seemed right.</p><p>Which means it&rsquo;s time to just <strong>make this version of the game!</strong></p><h2 id=lets-make-that>Let&rsquo;s make that</h2><h3 id=graphics>Graphics</h3><p>Such a simple game needs a very small list of graphics.</p><ul><li>A top-down fence</li><li>A top-down sheep. (With colored variations + simple symbols for specific Sheeple.)</li><li>Some green grass / meadow background texture.</li></ul><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even bother researching a <em>visual style</em> for that. I just asked AI to make me a lot of images, I drew them myself, I merged those efforts into something I thought looked decent.</p><p>Well, okay, that was the <em>intention</em>. The expectation from my end.</p><p>In reality, the forced top-down perspective of the game proved <strong>really difficult</strong>.</p><ul><li>The AI just <em>would not</em> truly understand the perspective, especially not for the fences.</li><li>Most of the time, it &ldquo;overdid&rdquo; the image. Adding way too much detail, color, glow, etcetera, which just <em>does not work</em> when the image has to be combined with other elements and tiles in a board game.</li><li>This was especially obvious with the grass texture. I just wanted some green, empty grass with perhaps a few flowers or visible stalks of grass. What does the AI give me, even when I tell it not to? Huge meadows, hundreds of flowers, shiny stones, fantasy landscapes as if seen from satellite view, etcetera.</li><li>With the sheep and the wolf, asking for top-down view (or satellite view, or bird&rsquo;s perspective) made the characters look <em>up</em> (towards the &ldquo;camera&rdquo;). Which, again, isn&rsquo;t great for this board game. It was near impossible to get rid of this.</li></ul><p>So despite getting really &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; images from AI&mdash;and only needing 4 good ones&mdash;I spent almost a whole day just trying to get where I wanted to go. (I saved some of those lush meadows and funny sheep in another folder, so maybe someday they&rsquo;ll return.)</p><p>In the end, I did the following.</p><ul><li>I noticed the AI would follow the perspective when asking for a <em>herd</em> of sheep. So I did that, cut out all the sheep (that looked right), upscaled them again, and used those after some edits/cleanup.</li><li>I drew my <em>own</em> rough version of a top-down fence and used &ldquo;img2img&rdquo; to render its shadows and detail. This worked kinda, but not good enough for me.</li><li>Growing increasingly frustrated, I decided to just <em>model</em> a 3D fence, place it in the right position, and see if that gives me something. That&rsquo;s when I realized &ldquo;surely others have modeled a wooden fence before&rdquo;, found a few free models, and used those.</li><li>In other words, the fences in this game are <em>screenshots</em> of a 3D modeled fence, with edits afterwards to make it fit a bit better.</li><li>(This is such a powerful technique that I&rsquo;m happy I realized the possibility and will surely use it more often, when I need a very specific object/perspective that is absolutely nowhere to be found in references.)</li><li>I picked <em>one</em> grass texture that wasn&rsquo;t incredibly detailed and could function as a background. Then I pasted that on top of some other textures, and erased/edited/blended the edges. So that, now, all grass tiles share the same center (which looks consistent) but only have different details at the edges.</li></ul><p>It was a lot of work. Still less work than if I had to draw it all myself. (The sheep would&rsquo;ve been fine, but I&rsquo;ve tried painting semi-realistic textures many times before and just don&rsquo;t grasp how it&rsquo;s done.) And it was instructive.</p><p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s the end result.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=meadowmight_assets_perhaps_final.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Tiamo from the future: I can already say that these are NOT the final assets." title="Tiamo from the future: I can already say that these are NOT the final assets." width=1284 height=600></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Tiamo from the future: I can already say that these are NOT the final assets.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=generator>Generator</h3><p>Then came the time to write the code to generate this material.</p><p>As stated, all possible combinations of tiles seemed equally useful, so I saw no reason to do any more algorithm magic.</p><p>I defined all possible fence configurations in a dictionary, including other metadata. (How often the tile should appear, whether it has a sheep variation or not, etcetera.)</p><p>Then my code simply loops through all these configurations, and for each &mldr;</p><ul><li>Creates the right fences.</li><li>Creates one tile with a sheep, one without.</li><li>Creates one tile with a Sheeple per player. (I decided to have a max player count of 5, though it could be 6 if we increase the deck size.)</li></ul><p>If this game receives expansions or other special tiles, it will only change the middle illustration (sheep or not), so I figured I could fit that new code into this system later if I wanted.</p><p>(It seemed logical to add something like a &ldquo;wolf tile&rdquo;, but I wasn&rsquo;t even sure what it would do, so I ignored any thought of expansions/variants until the base game was done.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=meadowmight_generated_tiles.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The &ldquo;done&rdquo; obviously comes from my generator feedback, not part of the tiles." title="The &ldquo;done&rdquo; obviously comes from my generator feedback, not part of the tiles." width=1177 height=930></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>The &ldquo;done&rdquo; obviously comes from my generator feedback, not part of the tiles.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=more-polishing>More polishing</h3><p>Seeing all tiles generated (and side by side), I saw some more graphical issues to improve.</p><ul><li>Some of the sheep aren&rsquo;t top-down perspective enough => I can remove their paws and change some shadows to make this more so.</li><li>Two of the fence types have strong shadows on them (from the 3D model thingy!). On their own, this looks fine. But when combined on a tile, this obviously creates a situation where light has no clear origin (it seems to come from everywhere). I can either reduce contrast on the images themselves, or arrange fences to make shadows appear on the same side.</li><li>Now I accidentally generated 5 tiles per player (because there are 5 configurations). I can&rsquo;t be sure if the game works best with 4 or 5 of them, so I&rsquo;ll probably leave this in and test both.</li></ul><p>All those tiny fixes are usually &ldquo;annoying&rdquo; to do (and take more time than you think), but they do lead to a more consistent and polished end result.</p><p>That said, this game was supposed to be very quick (as I didn&rsquo;t have more time to work on a bigger game in these weeks). And now it&rsquo;s already taking me way too long! So I probably have to accept some imperfections and just call it done.</p><h2 id=playtesting>Playtesting</h2><h3 id=results>Results</h3><p>Alright, we tested the game a few times, and &mldr; <strong>it just works?</strong></p><p>Below is an image of one of the final games. (As always, apologies for the lighting and mediocre camera quality.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=meadowmight_playtest_final.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="I won this game by just a few points; I was the pink hearts. The only reason yellow (my dad) didn&rsquo;t win, was because we rotated something to cut his huge meadow into two smaller ones in the last rounds." title="I won this game by just a few points; I was the pink hearts. The only reason yellow (my dad) didn&rsquo;t win, was because we rotated something to cut his huge meadow into two smaller ones in the last rounds." width=960 height=1280></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>I won this game by just a few points; I was the pink hearts. The only reason yellow (my dad) didn&rsquo;t win, was because we rotated something to cut his huge meadow into two smaller ones in the last rounds.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>Some rules needed clarification, so I rephrased it in the rules. One image in particular clearly isn&rsquo;t the same style as the others, so I&rsquo;ll have to redo that one.</p><p>But besides that? Nobody had any feedback, and I didn&rsquo;t notice any downsides to the game as it is now.</p><ul><li>Explanation and play is extremely simple and fast. (You&rsquo;re playing within one or two minutes, turns are fast, there&rsquo;s never long waits or uncertainty.)</li><li>You always have <em>something</em> to do, be it helping yourself, hindering another, or planning a big rotation in the future.</li><li>Scores are pretty tight. (Though that also happens naturally. Usually, near the end of the game, the player who is clearly ahead will be hindered by everyone else.)</li><li>The rule of &ldquo;no more rotating once a player is out of tiles&rdquo; also makes total sense and improves the game.</li><li>The number of fences / open tiles, and the number of sheep, also seem quite balanced. (As I already noted while testing the paper prototype against myself.) With effort, meadows can usually be closed <em>or</em> kept open to make it harder for the other player to close them.</li></ul><h3 id=improvement-end-game>Improvement: end game</h3><p>My <em>only</em> issue happened with the very <em>first</em> game(s) you play with a new group of people. They don&rsquo;t really see the extreme value of rotating a tile yet, which causes them to not use it a lot.</p><p>Which, in turn, causes a weird situation near the end of the game.</p><ul><li>The drawing deck is empty.</li><li>So &mldr; whether you place or rotate, you always <em>lose</em> one tile anyway. So the rotation action is basically free now!</li><li>Which means many players save it for <em>last</em>, which is the least interesting / impactful thing to do.</li></ul><p>This solves itself once players get a few games under their belt. They&rsquo;ll rotate and annoy each other right from the start :p</p><p>Still, it felt like something that a minor rules tweak could improve.</p><blockquote><p>To rotate, pay <em>2</em> tiles, then draw one from the deck.</p></blockquote><p>People were confused anyway that placing allowed you to draw, but rotating did not. With this change, rotation will automatically be more expensive (it actually costs you 2 tiles) once the deck runs out.</p><p>It also allows you to throw out a few tiles that aren&rsquo;t helping you, giving more options and strategy. So that&rsquo;s the one &ldquo;fix&rdquo; I made.</p><h3 id=improvement-deck-composition>Improvement: deck composition</h3><p>After even more playtests (and thinking), I decided to make the deck <em>slightly</em> larger. On the highest player counts, you really want a few extra tiles, especially now that rotating is more expensive.</p><p>What kind of tiles?</p><ul><li>Empty on all sides. (Prevents the game from being too closed and safe, with too many fences.)</li><li>Two fences. (Gives the most fun opportunities for rotating and conflict.)</li></ul><p>So I sprinkled in a few extra tiles of those types for the final &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; deck.</p><h3 id=improvement-out-of-your-comfort-zone>Improvement: out of your comfort zone</h3><p>After playtesting so many games, I&rsquo;ve noticed a general human truth. When a game is high interaction, most people will still try to stay in their comfort zone and avoid that interaction. Even if it means losing the game!</p><p>You can see that in the image I provided of one test game. Yellow (my dad) just built <em>one</em> huge meadow the whole game. He didn&rsquo;t even <em>consider</em> starting a new one somewhere else, as he thought it was too unsafe. (You can see there are no yellow Sheeple anywhere else.)</p><p>The result was that we only needed <em>one</em> rotation to break up that meadow, and he couldn&rsquo;t win anymore. So no, not a winning strategy. Not that fun either. But still &mldr; people go for it all the time.</p><p>So I changed the <strong>scoring rule</strong>. Because now, I accidentally <em>reward</em> this safe-but-useless behavior!</p><ul><li>Current rule: &ldquo;You score for <em>each Sheeple</em> in an enclosed meadow.&rdquo; (So 2 Sheeple in a meadow of 5 tiles, scores 10 points. This is what encourages players to just stick all their Sheeple into one big meadow and hope for the best.)</li><li>New rule: &ldquo;You score the size of each enclosed meadow that contains a Sheeple of yours.&rdquo; (So you only get those points <em>once</em>.)</li></ul><p>It can still be beneficial to place multiple Sheeple in that one meadow! (As backup, to break ties favorably on conflicts, etcetera.) But now you&rsquo;re rewarded for spreading out and playing a more interesting game.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>The old rule remains as part of the &ldquo;Fuzzy Fences&rdquo; variant, which I designed to be more <em>friendly</em> and to suit those who want a little less cutthroat interaction.</p></aside><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Besides that, because the game is such high interaction, how it plays out completely depends on the <em>players</em>. Some games are more &ldquo;solo&rdquo;, with fewer conflicts and people just building their own meadow. But that&rsquo;s fine, because players <em>choose</em> to play that way. If you want, there are always options to be aggressive or block each other.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really happy with this extremely simple yet tactical game! It&rsquo;s one of those rare cases where you envision a simple game, quickly make it, and it actually turns out the way you predicted (for the most part).</p><p>Until the next devlog, keep playing,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/split-the-foody/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-6" style=--rotation:1deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/hold-my-bear/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-5" style=--rotation:0deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
