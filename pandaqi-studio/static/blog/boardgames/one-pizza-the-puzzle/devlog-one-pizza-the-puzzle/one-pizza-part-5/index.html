mechanics and ideas that I wanted in the game. Unless they are <em>clearly</em>
much better than the rules for the base game, I move them to a section
&ldquo;Ideas for Expansions&rdquo; by default.</p><p>These ideas mainly fell into four categories:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> more ingredients that do cool stuff. (Although I
don&rsquo;t have room for them on a pizza, so these would act more like a
&ldquo;chameleon&rdquo; and could be stand-ins for any other ingredients.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Special Buildings:</strong> more buildings and locations on the map that
do something special when you&rsquo;re <em>on</em> or <em>around</em> them. For example,
maybe there is a small market where you can <em>trade</em> any ingredient
for another one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pizza Police:</strong> add traffic signs into the game (like one-way
routes), but compensate this by allowing players to <em>break</em> traffic
rules. However, if you break the law with the <strong>pizza</strong> <strong>police
watching</strong>, you are in trouble! (I don&rsquo;t know yet how that works, or
how the police moves/operates, but this is the main idea.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Extensions to the core gameplay:</strong> simple rules or mechanics that
<em>change</em> or <em>expand</em> one of the core mechanics. For example, here I
could re-introduce the fact that the <em>first</em> player to deliver a
pizza gets a <em>tip</em>.</p></li></ul><p>It felt like the Pizza Police was the most impactful expansion, which is
why I wanted to start there. There wasn&rsquo;t a concept of &ldquo;breaking traffic
laws&rdquo; anymore at this point, though, so I had to bring that back for
this expansion.</p><p>(As I create more of these games, I keep wondering whether the word
<em>expansion</em> is even a good fit. These are more like add-ons, or
upgrades, or higher difficulty levels which you often see in video
games. An &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; feels more suitable for something that adds like
twenty new components and a whole extra game board. Something bigger.)</p><h2 id=pizza-police>Pizza Police</h2><p>Breaking traffic laws has many consequences. Both in real life, and in
my pizza game.</p><p>Why? For example, without those laws you can just turn around 180
degrees on the same road. This means you can <em>zigzag</em> back-and-forth
around an ingredient building to just get <em>infinite ingredients!</em>
(Within a few turns, you can have like 10 tomatoes.)</p><p>It also means you can go <em>against</em> the usual direction, or become much
more <em>aggressive</em> when cutting off other players.</p><p>Therefore, whatever rule I invent for the pizza police, needs to make
sure the board stays <em>readable</em>, there are <em>no exploits</em>, and there is a
way to (strategically) <em>counter the aggressiveness.</em></p><p>Here are the images from the final rulebook for extra clarity, below
I&rsquo;ll explain everything in detail.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=one-pizza-11.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Police Line of Sight" title="Police Line of Sight" width=1241 height=790></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Police Line of Sight</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=one-pizza-12.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Police Move" title="Police Move" width=1242 height=790></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Police Move</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>Readability</strong>: at first, I wanted to make police identical to
couriers, in the sense that they also move along a line that you cannot
cross. This didn&rsquo;t work. There are already many lines on the board and
it would be hard to retrace whether a line came from the police or
another player.</p><p>The most logical solution, of course, was to make police lines
<em>different</em> (dotted, curvy, zigzag, whatever). In practice, however,
this was hard to discern as well. (Most players have trouble drawing
straight lines as it is, so they might accidentally draw a police line.)</p><p>All of these solutions were just &mldr; messy and convoluted, which is why
I eventually decided to pick the simplest option: police are represented
by <strong>icons</strong> at a specific location. To move them, simply write their
icon at a location <strong>at most X steps away</strong>. No line needed, just
teleport the thing. (As of right now, 8 steps of movement seems like a
good amount, but that will need playtesting.)</p><p><strong>No exploits</strong>: I added an extra rule to this expansion. &ldquo;You may only
possess one ingredient of each type.&rdquo; I like these kinds of rules. They
solve the issue of &ldquo;collecting infinite ingredients&rdquo;, whilst adding an
extra layer of strategy, because you need to plan <em>when</em> you collect
specific ingredients. That&rsquo;s a win-win! (I still need to see if it
actually works and is fun to play, though.)</p><p><strong>Counter the aggressiveness</strong>: if I allow players to <em>move</em> the police,
they can <em>protect themselves</em>. (&ldquo;Oh no, that player might cut me off and
ruin my plans, let&rsquo;s move the police here so they can&rsquo;t do that
anymore!)</p><p>Whilst writing the rules, I also realized that it would be useful if
players could <em>remove</em> the police. I don&rsquo;t like creating an extra action
or ingredient for this. Why? Because the action isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> powerful
(so eating one of your ingredients feels like a waste) and because I
don&rsquo;t want players to be able to remove police <em>whenever they want</em>.</p><p>If somebody places police to foil your plans, and you can just be like
&ldquo;oh well, guess I&rsquo;ll immediately remove the police&rdquo;, then the whole
mechanic doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Eventually, I came up with the following: &ldquo;whenever you pass over a
police icon with your courier, you <em>may</em> remove a <em>different</em> police
icon for free&rdquo;</p><p>This is easy to learn and use, but also creates strategy: if you want to
break traffic rules, you need to stay away from police &mldr; but also
close enough that you can <em>remove</em> other police icons if needed.</p><h2 id=special-ingredients-i>Special Ingredients I</h2><p>I decided to work on the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; expansion next, because it felt
the simplest. Just draw some more ingredients, invent cool actions for
them, and make them appear on the board.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t that simple.</p><p>My brain is really good at coming up with ideas, which is both a
blessing and a curse, because it also means that even the simplest ideas
can blow up into something much bigger and harder to figure out.</p><p>Eventually, I saw three types of ingredients:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chameleons</strong>: can be a substitute for regular ingredients, or
somehow make it easier to get them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superheroes</strong>: are useless when it comes to baking a pizza, but
have a really powerful action associated with them</p></li><li><p><strong>Side dishes</strong>: can be served <em>on top of</em> a regular pizza for a
certain bonus. These can be optional or required (in which case they
appear next to the pizza icon on the board).</p></li></ul><p>Because I wanted at least two of each type, this expansion ultimately
received 7 more ingredients.</p><p>The chameleons are the easiest: just make them appear on the board, and
players can figure out themselves (during the game) how they want to use
them.</p><p>After that, the side dishes were also relatively easy to implement. It&rsquo;s
quite intuitive that adding extra sauce (or a nice dessert) to a pizza
order will earn you more money. (The most difficult part was adding
these icons to the game board, because it was already quite full.)</p><p>The superheroes, however, took some time to figure out. In my notes, I
wrote the following ideas:</p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;I want something that allows you to <em>save</em> or <em>delay</em> turns.&rdquo;
(Because of all the same reasons I mentioned in the paragraphs about
Timing before.)</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;I want something that can <em>definitely</em> cut off another player.&rdquo;
(Because you have to extend your current line, you can never 100%
cut off a part of the board. Other players can simply take a detour
and then <em>follow your line</em> until they get where they want.)</p></li></ul><h2 id=special-ingredients-ii>Special Ingredients II</h2><p>After sleeping on it, I woke up the next day with the ultimate solution
to the second problem: <strong>line merging</strong>. If you stand in the same cell
as someone else, or an adjacent cell, you may <em>merge the lines into one</em>
(by connecting the endpoints).</p><p>Both players must reset their courier to the start, because, well, they
can&rsquo;t extend their line anymore. (Although they suffer no extra penalty
for this.)</p><p>This allows you to immediately <em>end</em> another player&rsquo;s courier, whilst
also creating a line that you can&rsquo;t move along, because it&rsquo;s connected
all the way through.</p><p>The first problem is still a work in progress. I&rsquo;m thinking about an
ingredient that <em>multiplies with itself</em>. Let&rsquo;s say the ingredient is
&mldr; lettuce. If you have 1 Lettuce, you may eat it to take 1 action
(which is useless). But if you have 2 lettuces, you may take 2x2 = 4
actions in a row (really powerful!) If you have 3, you may take 3x3 = 9
actions, and so on.</p><p>It has a nice risk/reward balance, because you need to collect multiple
lettuces over time to get a huge benefit. The problem is that this
quickly becomes <em>too</em> powerful, so I&rsquo;m still thinking about this.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m done with thinking!</strong> (About this expansion, not in general.)</p><p>In the last few playtests, I said that it was too easy (and too
powerful) to get new couriers. As I was solving some other problems, I
saw the focus of the game shift more towards &ldquo;line splitting&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s
when you send a courier in two different directions. This can happen by
eating the Broccoli ingredient, but there are also movement shapes that
have a split directly inside of them.</p><p>As such, the &ldquo;Superhero&rdquo; ingredients ended up as a way to <em>punish</em>
players if they split their line too often. For example, this is the
&ldquo;Garlic&rdquo; action:</p><p><strong>> If another courier is (at most) 3 cells away, you may steal 2
ingredients from them.</strong></p><p>If you split your line a lot, you have many open-ended paths all over
the board. This increases the probability that someone is 3 cells away
from an endpoint on your line, allowing them to use this Garlic action!</p><p>The &ldquo;Side dish&rdquo; ingredients also became slightly more complex. It was
boring to have an ingredient that &ldquo;always adds X money when delivered
with an order&rdquo;, because there was no strategy there. It was <em>always</em>
better to have it, and you were <em>sure</em> about the reward.</p><p>Instead, the three side dishes now do slightly different things:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Kale:</strong> when delivered with an order, pick one reward: either get
2 money or an extra courier. (The simplest one, but at least you get
some strategy here.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Dessert:</strong> when delivered with an order, the <em>reward</em> depends on
how many ingredients are in your pizza! So, preferably, you&rsquo;d add a
dessert to a <em>large</em> pizza &mldr; but that also brings a great risk
with it, as it&rsquo;s much harder to deliver those.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smoothie:</strong> these are required, which means they automatically
show up on the board and you <em>must</em> add them to a specific pizza.
However, they also have a very strong &ldquo;Eat&rdquo; action (duplicate one of
your ingredients for free), giving players a hard decision: use it
for that pizza, or use it for its action?</p></li></ul><p>Below is the final list of ingredients in this expansion.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=one-pizza-13.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Special Ingredients" title="Special Ingredients" width=793 height=1122></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Special Ingredients</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>This devlog continues at part 6, with even <em>more</em> talk about expansions!</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/one-pizza-the-puzzle/devlog-one-pizza-the-puzzle/one-pizza-part-4/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-1" style=--rotation:-0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/one-pizza-the-puzzle/devlog-one-pizza-the-puzzle/one-pizza-part-6/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-6" style=--rotation:1deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
