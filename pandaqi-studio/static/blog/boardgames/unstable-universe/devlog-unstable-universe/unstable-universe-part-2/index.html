Go to the <a href=../>devlog overview</a>.</p><h2 id=writing-the-rules>Writing the Rules</h2><p>Usually, you only encounter the biggest problems (but also find the most
creative solutions) once you actually start writing the rules and
determining the <em>specifics</em> of all the actions you can take in a game.</p><p>This game was no different.</p><p><strong>Realization #1:</strong> I soon realized that turning <em>all</em> nodes at the
edge into starting nodes was stupid. It was an overwhelming number of
options. And the ones nearest the center node were still always the
best.</p><p>Instead, I decided to do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Each edge (top, right, bottom, left) gets exactly 3 starting nodes.</p></li><li><p>I only pick the ones <em>furthest away</em> from the center node.</p></li><li><p>I don&rsquo;t allow two starting nodes to be connected to a common node.
(That would mean that the player who gets there first immediately
cuts off the other player, giving them a huge disadvantage at the
start of the game.)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Realization #2:</strong> If I create <em>too few</em> mission nodes, they become
too hard to execute. (If all players are fighting for a specific set of
nodes, for example, the game becomes near impossible to win.)</p><p>If I create <em>too many</em> mission nodes, however, they become overwhelming.
(Again. Creating games always seems to be a battle against overwhelming
players.)</p><p>Instead, I decided on a total of 10 unique mission nodes, of which 4
only appear when certain expansions are enabled.</p><p>Additionally, at first I thought along the lines of &ldquo;hmm, maybe I will
just scatter a handful of nodes around the map and ask you to pick them
all up&rdquo; (like the Twinbird). But that quickly becomes stale and
repetitive.</p><p>Instead, I decided to view Mission Nodes as a sort of &ldquo;player roles&rdquo;. I
wanted each mission to force players to <em>change</em> their play style and
look at the board a different way. I hope my final set of mission nodes
accomplishes this well.</p><p><strong>Realization #3:</strong> If I move the idea of <em>Expeditions</em> to an expansion
&mldr; I can fit <strong>all the rules on a single page!</strong> Amazing!</p><p>And so I did. &ldquo;Extreme Expeditions&rdquo; is, at the moment, one of three
expansions to the game.</p><p>I also decided to properly name all the node types, which makes the
rules (and gameplay) much simpler. We have:</p><ul><li><p>Mission Nodes (you start on it, gives you a goal)</p></li><li><p>Regular Nodes (resource + action, all other nodes)</p></li><li><p>Expedition Nodes (in the center of an enclosed area, only triggers
when it is cut loose)</p></li></ul><h2 id=creating-the-visuals>Creating the Visuals</h2><p>I usually only talk about creating the <em>visuals</em> and generating the
<em>game board</em> in my Technical Devlog.</p><p>But I wanted to shortly touch upon those aspects here, as they turned
out to be harder than I thought, and impacted many rules decisions.</p><p>This game is called <strong>Unstable Universe</strong>. What is the most unstable
form of drawing/designing? <em>Sketching</em>. And so, all elements in the game
(the icons, the nodes, etc.) have a loose and sketchy look.</p><p>Take a look below for a comparison between a computer-drawn (&ldquo;perfect&rdquo;)
game board and one that uses the sketchy art:</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=uu-tech-6.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Very old version of the board" title="Very old version of the board" width=1128 height=798></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Very old version of the board</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=uu-tech-7.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Newer version with sketchy art style" title="Newer version with sketchy art style" width=1128 height=798></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Newer version with sketchy art style</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>This looks really cute and fitting! But when I add too many elements on
the page, this quickly becomes a mess (because of the funky art style).</p><p>By far the best solution was adding <em>color</em> to the game following a
certain logic. I invented several categories (such as Nature, Natural
Resources, Magic, &mldr;) and tried to give each expansion 1-2 nodes per
category. By adding color, the board looks better and neater, but it
also helps to quickly identify what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p><p>Secondly, this influenced my decision to keep the base game really
simple. I wanted to do crazy stuff, like add &ldquo;secret gold/treasures&rdquo;
between nodes and allow players to retrieve them with some weird cutting
maneuvers &ndash; but all of that just felt way too complicated.</p><p>In the end, there was only <em>one crazy idea</em> I had that passed the test:
a node that allows you to draw <strong>new edges</strong>. (Yes, I only got this idea
by staring at game boards and thinking &ldquo;surely, I should be able to do
something nice with all that white space&rdquo;)</p><p>When you enter the <em>dynamite</em> node, you are allowed to draw a new edge
from that node to any other, as long as you don&rsquo;t cross anything on your
way and it&rsquo;s a straight line. This edge then simply becomes part of the
game: you can use it for travel, you can use it when cutting.</p><p><em>This is the real power of One Paper Games</em>. I constantly need to remind
myself of this fact. Because we have a paper, because we can draw on it,
we can do <em>much more creative things</em> than move people around. We can
draw on the paper, invent our own icons, give stuff names, whatever!</p><p>Anyway, we&rsquo;re finally ready to playtest the game &mldr; I just need to
invent 9 other nodes (besides the dynamite).</p><p><em>Remark:</em> yes, I decided to do 10 mission nodes in total, and 10 regular
nodes for the base game, because that felt &mldr; consistent. It also meant
I could fit everything on a <em>single page</em> in the rules, which is always
nice. It saves space <em>and</em> makes it easier to look up the meaning if
players forget it, because you know it will always be on the same page.</p><h2 id=dont-forget-the-theme>Don&rsquo;t forget the Theme!</h2><p>There&rsquo;s one thing we haven&rsquo;t really discussed yet, and that is
<strong>theme</strong>. For some reason, it took me way too long to figure this one
out. In hindsight, it is obvious:</p><p><strong>It is a metaphor for climate change (or destroying the environment
because of commercialism).</strong></p><p>You want to win the game by grabbing resources &mldr; but to get a
resource, you usually need to <em>cut into the paper</em> (aka &ldquo;destroy the
environment&rdquo;).</p><p>What&rsquo;s the most obvious resource to use for such a system? Yes, it is
<strong>oil</strong>. (Another advantage: an oil drop makes a recognizable icon on
the board, even more so as a sketch.)</p><p>The most <strong>prominent</strong> node in the game is now oil. And it does exactly
what you expect: when you enter it, you must perform a basic cutting
action ( = &ldquo;drill into the earth to get your oil&rdquo;)</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure this whole concept will be lost on most of the players, but
hey, if at least some people realize what it&rsquo;s about, that&rsquo;s a win!</p><h2 id=which-actions-are-fun>Which actions are fun?</h2><p>Because I invented the Mission Nodes first, I knew <em>what kind of</em> nodes
I needed to make those missions viable. For example, one mission asks
you to possess <em>more</em> nodes than any other player. That is only possible
if there is a way to <em>skip your turn</em> or <em>take two turns after each
other</em>, or things like that.</p><p>These &ldquo;action types&rdquo; seemed most fun and essential:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cutting</strong> (with or without some restrictions, like disallowing
certain combinations or stopping immediately after hitting a certain
node)</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn</strong> (skip a turn, do another turn for free, block someone
else&rsquo;s turn, &mldr;)</p></li><li><p><strong>Modify</strong> (draw a new edge with the <em>dynamite</em>, destroy a node,
&mldr;)</p></li><li><p><strong>Movement</strong> (teleport across the map, leapfrog over someone, &mldr;)</p></li><li><p><strong>Progression</strong> (you need to collect X nodes of a certain type
before you can <em>pass</em> a certain monster or gate or challenge)</p></li><li><p><strong>Blocking</strong> (forbid, barricade, destroy a certain action for
another player)</p></li><li><p><strong>Ownership</strong> (share a node with someone else, get back a node
you&rsquo;ve lost, &mldr;)</p></li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s two diagrams I made for myself that show how all the nodes are distributed across the categories and action types. (I almost always do this for games, to get a nice overview and to automatically balance expansions and make them as varied as possible.) These are the (almost final) versions I made near the end, so they also include the other expansions, which we&rsquo;ll talk about soon!</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=uu-tech-8.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Diagram of Node Categories" title="Diagram of Node Categories" width=1731 height=512></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Diagram of Node Categories</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=uu-tech-9.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Diagram of Action Types" title="Diagram of Action Types" width=1937 height=670></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Diagram of Action Types</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>Another interesting example if <strong>blocking</strong> is something like the &ldquo;Cute
Puppy&rdquo;. If you are responsible for destroying this node (or cutting it
loose), you get a severe penalty. This acts as a sort of block: nobody
wants that penalty, so they will stay away from harming the puppy.
Perhaps they&rsquo;ll cut around it, or wait a few turns before moving in.</p><p>The <strong>modify-type</strong> nodes are most creative, but also most powerful, so
I only invented a few of them and spread those across the expansions.</p><p>(For example, there is one Expedition Node that allows you to <em>reattach</em>
the piece of paper that just came loose. This effectively allows you to
rearrange the board and move a whole group of nodes to somewhere else.
Very cool, never saw that before in a game, but also perhaps too
powerful.)</p><p>There&rsquo;s one specific <strong>turn-type</strong> node that I found so interesting,
that it basically shaped the whole first expansion to the game. It&rsquo;s the
<strong>Time Trick</strong> node. It allows you to &ldquo;save&rdquo; a turn for later. Why do I
think it&rsquo;s so special? Because this is the only thing that would allow
you to <em>plan far ahead</em> and use a <em>long-term strategy</em> in such a simple
game.</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/unstable-universe/devlog-unstable-universe/unstable-universe-part-1/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-1" style=--rotation:0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/unstable-universe/devlog-unstable-universe/unstable-universe-part-3/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-7" style=--rotation:2deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
