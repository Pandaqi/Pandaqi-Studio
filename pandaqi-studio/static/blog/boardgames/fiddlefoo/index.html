In this article, I&rsquo;ll talk about the process behind developing the game, problems I solved, why I made certain decisions, and hopefully more interesting or instructive bits.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>A while ago I stumbled upon a game called <strong>Cabanga!</strong> The premise is very simple yet very effective.</p><ul><li>There are four colors.</li><li>Each color has two cards on the table (one left, one right)</li><li>On your turn, you must place a card on the pile of its color, either left or right.</li><li>This creates a <em>number range</em>. For example, the card on the left might be 5, and the one on the right might be 10.</li><li><em>Anyone who has a card of the same color, in that range, discards it.</em> (And for each discarded card, you must draw a new one.)<ul><li>For example, you played that Red 5.</li><li>Then another player has a Red 7&mdash;which is between 5 and 10&mdash;and may yell <em>Cabanga!</em> and discard it.</li></ul></li><li>The game ends when a person is out of cards. Those who have cards get minus points.</li></ul><p>As expected, it&rsquo;s a game about trying to create the <em>smallest</em> possible range (or one you expect others won&rsquo;t punish you for). Simple rules, but a lot of emergent strategy the more you play it. (For example, it can be wise to play a &ldquo;riskier&rdquo; card now, just to draw out certain cards from other players. With those cards out of their hand, <em>they</em> might be forced to make an even worse play.)</p><p>When I played it, I immediately had a few thoughts.</p><ul><li>Everyone forgets the extra rule of &ldquo;If you play the same color as the previous player, draw a card&rdquo;, constantly.<ul><li>I can absolutely see why they added it. Such a simple way to make choices harder and sometimes make a good number bad anyway, because the previous player played the same color. But it&rsquo;s also a loose exception that players just <em>keep forgetting all the time</em>.</li></ul></li><li>You don&rsquo;t get the cards others throw away; instead, you discard those and draw equally many new ones. This means the game has quite a high number of cards. (Which makes gameplay quite different depending on player count. With only 3 players, it&rsquo;s very unlikely somebody has a Cabanga, just because <em>so many</em> cards are stuck in the draw/discard piles.)</li><li>Can we expand the idea to be a little more dynamic and varied? I don&rsquo;t like games with such a rigid set of piles or card placement. <em>Can we turn the idea into a shared map?</em></li><li>Can we expand the idea to be a little less reliant on luck or just getting a good hand?<ul><li>In some games, certain colors barely showed up. This meant you had absolutely no way to reduce the damage, and you had to just accept a terrible move at some point.</li><li>On the other hand, if a color shows up <em>a lot</em>, then people will likely have numbers <em>in order</em> and there&rsquo;s almost zero chance of &ldquo;Cabanga"s.</li></ul></li><li>Cards also show &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo;. In Cabanga!, these are merely your negative points if you end a round with that. <em>Can we reuse them for other mechanics?</em> (If we&rsquo;re going to add an extra element to a card, I really want to get the most use out of it as possible.)</li></ul><p>And so &ldquo;Fiddlefoo&rdquo; was born. (I just wanted some word that was fun to shout and had the right vibe.)</p><p>I transformed the idea as follows.</p><ul><li>Cards are placed in a shared map in the center of the table. In other words, on your turn you simply play a new card adjacent to what&rsquo;s already there.<ul><li>Besides a unique number, my cards also show those &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; (or some other icon based on the theme I&rsquo;ll eventually choose) in the range of 0&ndash;4.</li></ul></li><li>You <em>must</em>, however, play a card in the same row/column as another of the same color. That&rsquo;s how you create that &ldquo;range&rdquo; between 2 numbers.</li><li>Then we get that core mechanic: anybody who has a number within that range, throws it at you.<ul><li>You actually get these cards; there&rsquo;s no large draw/discard pile.</li></ul></li><li>Then we get the twists:<ul><li>If the <em>distance</em> between the cards is greater than X (probably 3 or 4), others do NOT give you any cards.</li><li>Instead of handing numbers within the range, you may also discard cards whose <em>number of diamonds</em> is equal to that <em>distance</em> instead.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Why did I <em>think</em> this would be a good idea?</p><ul><li>Now we build a map over time (progress, momentum, a sense of ownership to a game) and the choice of where to place your card is strategic and interesting.</li><li>The amount of material needed is far lower, and we can still support player counts of 2&ndash;6.</li><li>If you have terrible cards, you can still find ways to reduce the penalty if you place them right. (Plan ahead to make sure you can create a large distance when you play the card.)</li><li>Similarly, you can get rid of those terrible cards thanks to the <em>diamond rule</em>. But it&rsquo;s a choice, one that you and other players can influence and manipulate.</li></ul><h2 id=lets-test-that>Let&rsquo;s test that!</h2><p>I had some paper prototype cards left on my desk from testing another game. (That was &ldquo;Death by Digits&rdquo;; will probably come out around the same time.) All I had to do was add a fourth card of every number + write the 4 symbols (for the different colors) on them, then extend the numbers to range from 1&ndash;16. (Which was just a random guess, to be honest.)</p><p>Then I played the current rules and, as usual, discovered they were terrible.</p><p><strong>Problem #1:</strong> 4x16 cards is still too much. Especially on low player counts, you&rsquo;ll have <em>most</em> cards out of the game, and very little chance of &ldquo;Fiddlefoo"s.</p><ul><li>Lowering that number isn&rsquo;t great. You <em>need</em> a good distance between numbers to allow larger gaps.</li><li>Lowering the number of unique colors also didn&rsquo;t work. Three colors made the map lopsided and uninteresting.</li><li>So, instead, I decided to just make the colors <em>asymmetric</em>: some have more numbers than others. (For example, 3x16 + 1x6 = 54 cards, which is a standard deck and always a good target.)</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #2:</strong> What if you match <em>multiple</em> cards of the same color (in the same row/column)?</p><ul><li>My first idea was to just say &ldquo;pick one of the ranges&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s not a meaningful choice, as you&rsquo;ll always pick the smaller one.</li><li>I tried to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just not allowed&rdquo;, but that made placement less interesting. (You already have few options, and by disallowing multiple, the map will mostly be built in one long column instead of a somewhat square map.)</li><li>The best solution was simply: &ldquo;if you have multiple possible ranges, you must pick the largest one&rdquo;. (With less material, we reduce our chance of Fiddlefoos. So this rule is simple <em>and</em> stacks the cards against the player, making every play more risky.)</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #3:</strong> We need some replacement for that rule I mentioned that everyone&rsquo;s forgetting. Something that makes turns <em>less boring/straightforward</em> when you happen to have the exact number below/above another one. (Which would create a 0 range and no penalty for you, so always the best move.)</p><ul><li>The diamond rule, though, already helps here. Even if you place a 6 to match a 7, there might still be X cards between them, which means anyone can give you a card with X diamonds.</li><li>But a simple rule that establishes the same thing&mdash;and more&mdash;is that &ldquo;cards of the same color cannot be adjacent&rdquo;. This forces those cards to be spread out, is very easy to check and remember, and is always possible. No more &ldquo;Red 6 next to Red 7, hey, nothing happens, easy turn!&rdquo;</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #4:</strong> The diamond rule is currently a bit too powerful, though. Because there are only a few options for distance/#diamonds, you&rsquo;re more likely to be able to give away loads of cards on another player&rsquo;s turn.</p><ul><li>So, instead, let&rsquo;s change the rule to what I wanted to do anyway: &ldquo;If you give away based on the diamond rule, you may only give away 1 card this turn.&rdquo;</li><li>Also, let&rsquo;s make it <strong>optional</strong>. You&rsquo;re not required to give cards away. It is <em>usually</em> good&mdash;because you win when out of cards&mdash;but sometimes you want to keep those cards to make your future turns easier.</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #5:</strong> Although we have little material, and most of it is in the hands of players, we can&rsquo;t give players <em>all</em> cards. That was extremely overwhelming when I tried it. (There&rsquo;s also no way to fairly subdivide the deck over any player count.)</p><ul><li>Instead, let&rsquo;s say players begin with 7 or 8 cards. The rest becomes a draw pile.</li><li>But then we needed a way to actually <em>draw</em> cards. I had a few loose ends left, so this was a way to tie them off.<ul><li>If your card placement is invalid (adjacent to same color, for example), draw a card. => This means you can <em>always</em> play, but just get penalized if it&rsquo;s invalid, which should be very rare.</li><li>If you meet the distance requirement (your biggest gap is more than 3 cards apart), nobody else gives you anything, but you draw a card. => Drawing a new card is <em>usually</em> less bad than letting other players throw theirs at you. But now it&rsquo;s a choice you can make strategically: do I risk getting loads of cards from other players, or pick the option where I get exactly 1 card for sure?</li><li>(Also, the draw pile can be empty, in which case this penalty falls away and I&rsquo;m absolutely fine with that.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>With these changes, the game flowed much better when I tested it against myself.</p><p>Always possible placements on the map, with different reasons for why they were interesting. On every turn, the <em>other players</em> also remain active and involved, checking if they can lose some cards. And if so, <em>which ones</em> they want to lose.</p><p>The simple rules about distance, diamonds, and not allowing adjacency (of same color) ended up solving another problem I had with the first prototype.</p><p>As opposed to Cabanga!, players simply get the cards that others throw at them. It makes rules simpler and more intuitive, so I wanted to stick to that. The issue, though, is that this means the player now (guaranteed) has a few numbers close to numbers already on the board. So those numbers would be incredibly easy to play, right?</p><p>For example: you played a range of 1 and 5. Others gave you their 2 and 3. Now you have two numbers <em>really close</em> to ones already on the map, so a few safe turns in the future.</p><p>Well, not so fast!</p><ul><li>You can&rsquo;t play adjacent, so <em>other</em> players will have to help you out by building cards around that 1 or 5. Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t connect with them anyway.</li><li>Others might have given you cards based on the <em>diamond</em> rule, which might be completely different numbers or colors.</li><li>You might want to <em>wait</em> to get more distance for when you play those &ldquo;safe&rdquo; cards. But the longer you wait, of course, the more volatile/different the board gets.</li></ul><p>I found, at least when testing it myself, that everything was neatly balanced. No numbers were inherently better or worse. There were always interesting choices, even on other player&rsquo;s turns. And my simplifications/streamlining of <em>Cabanga!</em> had few drawbacks because of other changes I made.</p><p>Now there&rsquo;s nothing more to do than just make those cards and test with others!</p><h2 id=lets-make-that>Let&rsquo;s make that!</h2><p>Fiddlefoo brings to mind images of the <em>fiddle</em> of course, of music and dancing. So that became the theme of this game.</p><ul><li>I found some nice fonts that are related to music/dancing. (There are fonts that more clearly have that theme, with their letters changed into instruments and stuff. But those are completely unreadable in such a context :p)</li><li>The &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; on the cards became music notes.</li><li>The remaining decoration became common music symbols and textures, such as the lines from sheet music.</li></ul><p>Besides that, all cards are just a big COLOR and NUMBER. (And, to aid the colorblind, a unique SYMBOL matching the color too.)</p><p>Very easy code to generate, very easy code to draw. Not much to say there.</p><p>As I developed further, I did start thinking about some variants or expansions.</p><ul><li>That &ldquo;weird color&rdquo; (with fewer cards) could be a <em>wildcard</em>. That would be <em>very</em> interesting in this particular game.<ul><li>In other words, this doesn&rsquo;t add new material&mdash;it merely recontextualizes the base material you already have.</li></ul></li><li>Perhaps some cards with special actions when played. This gives another interesting decision: the number on the card could create a <em>terrible</em> range for you, but you want the action!</li><li>Such actions would allow anything that currently isn&rsquo;t possible. (Swapping cards, discarding cards some other way, looking at other player&rsquo;s cards, moving card positions on the map, playing on top of an existing card, etcetera.)</li><li>Perhaps a cooperative version?<ul><li>Next to the board, you&rsquo;re creating a faceup pile for each color.</li><li>Instead of &ldquo;throw away cards at another player&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d discard those cards to those piles. However, they must be added to <em>in numerical order</em>.</li><li>You win the game if, when all players have emptied their hand, each faceup pile holds between X and Y &ldquo;music notes&rdquo;.</li></ul></li></ul><p>But I don&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate simple card games that <em>just work</em>. So I stopped myself here and thought that was enough.</p><p>You can see some general early sketches below.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=fiddlefoo_sketches.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="A few steps in the exploration process to find a suitable card design." title="A few steps in the exploration process to find a suitable card design." width=896 height=344></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>A few steps in the exploration process to find a suitable card design.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>After all this time, I&rsquo;m quite good at finding fonts, and I also have a big library/backlog of &ldquo;pretty fonts to use for a project of type X or Y&rdquo;. This quickly led me to a nice and readable serif font for longer text (such as actions on cards), and a classical-music-like font for the numbers and headings. I especially liked that this heading font was very <em>thick</em>, which always helps make things more readable and approachable in general.</p><p>(Nothing worse than trying to play a board game and people get demotivated right from the start because the <em>text on the cards is sooooo darn tiny</em>.)</p><p>I copied the colors of the <em>Cabanga!</em> game, though with slight modifications. I added the musical instruments to add an extra way to identify cards. (Just color is not enough, especially to colorblind people of course.) I also added a written text of the card (&ldquo;Two of Yellow&rdquo;) because &mldr; I felt like it, but let&rsquo;s say it was a very informed choice to make it even easier to identify cards.</p><p>As stated, this was just a very tiny, quick, side-project. (I made it in side-by-side with the other game that will probably release on the same day: Death by Digits.)</p><p>This means that I ended up with a final, simple card design rather quickly. And I just &mldr; made that? There were no big challenges, or problems, or interesting things to talk about.</p><p>Really, I&rsquo;m trying to find <em>anything</em> else to mention here, make the devlog a bit more interesting or meaty, but &mldr; that&rsquo;s just it.</p><p>The game looks pretty good, it&rsquo;s simple and minimal but works, and I don&rsquo;t know what else to say.</p><h3 id=simulation>Simulation</h3><p>Oh, I do have one final thing to say. When simulating the game (through the interactive example in the rulebook), these were the results.</p><ul><li><strong>Average #turns per game is ~18.5</strong>. (This was 22 at first, when I&rsquo;d forgotten to code that cards thrown at you actually, you know, <em>switch hands</em>.)</li><li><strong>Percentage turns where cards are given is ~92%</strong>. This means that <em>most</em> turns will allow someone to give at least one card away, but not all of them. That&rsquo;s a good balance. (This was only 75% at first, when I still had that bug I just mentioned.)<ul><li>This is interesting, because it means that actually <em>giving the cards</em> somehow makes you more likely to give them away later too, but <em>also</em> makes the game <em>shorter</em>.</li><li>Anyway, it&rsquo;s all good news for game balance.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Average #cards given is 2.8</strong>. So, in a turn where somebody receives cards, they receive 3 on average. This feels a bit high, but then again, my simulation plays <em>randomly</em> and players just give away <em>everything they can</em>. In a real game, you&rsquo;ll likely play smarter (creating smaller ranges) and not give away everything (to save a good card for your own next turn)</li><li><strong>Percentage of &ldquo;safe&rdquo; turns (distance > 3) is 5%.</strong> This is, again, on the low side. But these computer players aren&rsquo;t trying to do achieve this special case at all, so then you&rsquo;re unlikely to manage it. Even so, 1 in 20 turns being &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, means that even in random play it will happen once in an average game.</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s some very basic intelligence in those computer players, such as &ldquo;if you can give away LOADS of cards based on NUMBER, do that, instead of giving 1 based on distance&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s extremely rudimentary and really doesn&rsquo;t influence these statistics much.</p><p>On the interactive example, I &ldquo;pre-play&rdquo; 10&ndash;20 moves, just to get more varied situations and make the board look more interesting. The simulation starts, as it should, with the 2x2 starting board and every player 8 cards.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>I simply have a single variable I can set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> to turn the interactive example into a simulation (play 10,000 games; give no feedback or visuals of course). Otherwise, it&rsquo;s usually all exactly the same code.</p></aside><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Another game done! Hopefully one that brings some people joy and that accomplished some of my original vision. (Which was to bring the original idea of <em>Cabanga!</em>, which is quite good, into different dimensions and game design directions. Add some extra strategy and variety, and make the game a little &ldquo;meatier&rdquo;.)</p><p>I&rsquo;m trying to alternate between bigger projects and smaller ones. This summer, however, I ended up making a lot of <em>video games</em> again. And let me tell you: making video games is haaaaard. It&rsquo;s just such an incredible pile of work, in 20 different disciplines, that even tiny games (which I made) feel like huge undertakings.</p><p>As such, I didn&rsquo;t feel ready to tackle a bigger board game when I was done with Fiddlefoo. I&rsquo;ll probably work on more of my &ldquo;tiniest ideas&rdquo; (mostly simple card games or tile games with number) the coming weeks.</p><p>Until the next devlog,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/naivigation/wind-up-at/sint-spellen/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-3" style=--rotation:0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/death-by-digits/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-2" style=--rotation:-0.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
