It will be a rather <em>short</em> devlog (relatively speaking, at least), because this was a very small project that I basically made &ldquo;on the side&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to make games even simpler and more accessible.</p><p>Recently, I had several ideas for this. (<a href=https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/magnetmen/>Magnetmen</a> being another one that&rsquo;ll probably have released before this one.)</p><p>This was the &ldquo;second best idea&rdquo; I had, in my eyes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s based on something that sounds difficult, but really isn&rsquo;t: superposition (from quantum physics). Nevertheless, because it <em>sounds</em> difficult, I decided to stay away from that word and any science-related theme, and just theme this game as a (jungle) exploration game.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the idea?</p><ul><li>All squares on the board start with 4 icons. (They are, currently, all 4 things at the same time.)</li><li>Every turn, you take one step. (You start at the edge.)</li><li>When you do, you pick <em>one</em> icon from your previous square. (In other words, when leaving a square, you <em>choose</em> which of the 4 things it actually is.)</li></ul><p>Over time, this means the board &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; from all its possibilities &mldr; into one where most (or all) squares are actually, permanently fixed into one thing. (Basically a wave collapse algorithm, in board game form. If that means anything to you.)</p><p>That&rsquo;s &mldr; the whole game. (See what I mean about making games simpler and simpler?)</p><ul><li>You have plenty meaningful decisions. (Where to move; and which icon to choose of the 4 options when leaving.)</li><li>There&rsquo;s extremely high interaction. (The decisions that <em>other</em> players make&mdash;which types they collapse into&mdash;changes your potential moves or score over time.)</li><li>You are in control and have full information. (No luck, randomness, separate sheet with rules needed, etcetera.)</li><li>It truly feels like an unexplored area slowly comes into focus and is explored.</li><li>And all of that with extremely simple rules!</li></ul><p>It sounded like a winner to me.</p><p>At first, the working title was &ldquo;Quantum Quest&rdquo;. Which, honestly, is a fine title, but I don&rsquo;t want people to make the wrong assumptions about the game.</p><p>So I pivoted towards the following: you&rsquo;re explorers going through a landscape covered in <em>mist</em>. That&rsquo;s why all squares are currently &ldquo;4 possibilities&rdquo;, and you can only know what each square is once you visit it :)</p><p>Hence, <strong>The Mist</strong>.</p><h2 id=lets-make-that>Let&rsquo;s make that</h2><p>Just like Magnetmen, this is a quick side project just to take a break from the bigger ones. I pushed all doubts aside and just <em>made it</em> with whatever came to mind.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>If I design the rules well, this game might actually simulate &ldquo;wave collapse&rdquo; really well. That&rsquo;s an algorithm used in video games to randomly generate a sensible, organic landscape. This game basically models it already with its core rules&mdash;if I add smart square types, you might end up with a pretty landscape at the end of the game!</p></aside><p>I already had the fonts. (Once in a while, I research fonts for a new project, and then I push any unused fonts to upcoming projects. That&rsquo;s how my next 10 projects often already have their fonts selected :) )</p><p>It&rsquo;s a One Paper Game, so we&rsquo;re limited to one paper. One side will be the board, the other side is a &ldquo;sidebar&rdquo; containing the tutorial for the game.</p><p>Each square needs one icon on all the four sides, and one big circle in the center (for drawing your player icon, to keep track where you&rsquo;re moving).</p><p>And that&rsquo;s really all we need.</p><p>Below is a very rudimentary sketch.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=board_sketch_v1.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="This is really just to figure out how much should fit in the sidebar and basic colors." title="This is really just to figure out how much should fit in the sidebar and basic colors." width=1754 height=1240></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>This is really just to figure out how much should fit in the sidebar and basic colors.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=cell-types>Cell Types</h3><p>I can&rsquo;t really say much about this. I simply brainstorm all possible ways you might <em>score</em> in such a game. All useful <em>actions</em> you might want to take, either to help yourself or hinder opponents.</p><p>That results in a HUGE list.</p><p>I combine things that are similar. I remove things that seem too weak or rare, or too hard to explain. (Remember that <em>all</em> the rules are on the paper itself, so any power that needs more than 10 words for the explanation is already danger territory.)</p><p>I rely on my experience creating powers/abilities for 50+ games already. Just a gut feeling that says &ldquo;this might lead to confusion&rdquo; or &ldquo;meh this doesn&rsquo;t seem <em>fun</em>&rdquo;.</p><p>Whatever&rsquo;s left is good enough to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Add into the data. (Each of these games has one big code file with <em>all</em> powers that can appear, tagged with all sorts of things to ensure a balanced generation. And, of course, a way to know which image to display.)</li><li>And turn into an illustration.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that second point now.</p><h3 id=graphics>Graphics</h3><p>I researched some styles that give off that jungle, exploration, safari vibe. But also styles that are a bit more dark, gloomy, threatening. Deeper shadows and sharper lighting&mdash;not just happy, cartoony, colorful icons. (We&rsquo;re exploring an area covered in mist, after all.)</p><p>Then I asked an old version of Stable Diffusion (the only one I could find that had enough free credits for this project) to create those images.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>Yes, yes, one day I am able to afford a new computer that actually works and can do graphical work offline. Opening illustration software and making <em>edits</em> is already a tough sell for my broken laptop.</p></aside><h3 id=sets>Sets</h3><p>As always, it&rsquo;s too overwhelming to dump <em>all possible squares</em> onto the player at once. Even with rules on the board,</p><ul><li>Some squares are simply more vital than others.</li><li>Some are simpler (or need fewer words to explain them) than others.</li><li>Some can only be understood well if you&rsquo;ve played the game a few times and see the strategy behind them.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, for me&mdash;the developer&mdash;it&rsquo;s also overwhelming to work on 20 or 30 possible squares at once.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I usually break it down into smaller sets. Sets that are handpicked and balanced with themselves.</p><p>In this case, I noticed a few global types of actions.</p><ul><li><strong>Scoring</strong>: these simply score points, potentially based on some other condition.</li><li><strong>Terraforming</strong>: these are nature elements that shape the board into a somewhat organic map over time. (You&rsquo;re encouraged to use them by getting points.)</li><li><strong>Movement</strong>: these change how you or other players can <em>move</em>. (As moving is <em>the only thing you do in this game</em>, it deserves to be in its own category.)</li><li><strong>Action</strong>: any other type of action, usually with a point penalty to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for it.</li></ul><p>As expected, each set should be a mix of all types.</p><h3 id=finishing-touches>Finishing Touches</h3><p>At some point, I wanted to make the <em>edge</em> squares of the board empty. To clearly signal that you <em>enter</em> the game from there. (They were also called entrances/exits in the rules.)</p><p>But that just seemed unnecessarily complicated. The phrase &ldquo;you start at a square on the edge&rdquo; seems clear to me. Making the whole board consistent is also worth a lot.</p><p>Similarly, the original rules (or perhaps a &ldquo;variation&rdquo;) changed the order.</p><ul><li>You move first.</li><li>Then pick one correct icon on your new square.</li></ul><p>This intuitively makes more sense, but it leads to one major issue: <strong>you don&rsquo;t know where you are</strong>. Your &ldquo;current location&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t clearly defined, because your player icon will be drawn in <em>all the tiles you visited thus far</em>.</p><p>By switching the order, you now know: I am at the one tile showing my player icon which still has all its icons. (Because you only pick one upon <em>leaving</em>.)</p><p>This may seem a minor thing. But this actually solves one of the biggest issues plaguing my One Paper Games so far. I always have to find a solution for &ldquo;moving pawns&rdquo; (in an easy, fast, clear way).</p><p>The more I work on the game, the more I confirm that this switched order is far better for the game.</p><p>Also, you can score by simply tracing the path you walked&mdash;looking at all squares with your player icon inside. This also solves a recurring challenge with One Paper Games: how to keep track of permanent data such as score or things collected.</p><p>In other games (such as Magnetmen), I had to add an &ldquo;inventory&rdquo; to the edge of the board. (Each player has a strip of empty squares in which they write/draw permanent progress). But that takes space, looks less appealing, and quickly feels overwhelming.</p><p>I decided to design the game in such a way that I can completely remove all of that. It&rsquo;s just a board (with consistent, uniform squares) + the rules to the side.</p><p>I think that covers everything. Let&rsquo;s test!</p><h3 id=balanced-generation>Balanced generation</h3><p>The generator for this game is basically a copy of the one for Magnetmen, with a few things swapped behind the scenes. (I turned some parts of the code into reusable modules, but otherwise don&rsquo;t want to optimize prematurely. I&rsquo;m fine with a few lines of copied code between projects.)</p><p>Not much interesting there. The rules of the game allow mostly random generation, without much tweaking from my end.</p><p>That said, there is always SOME tweaking needed to keep random generation within limits. (Or to simply create nicer board that automatically lead to better games.)</p><p>First of all, <strong>no duplicates on cells</strong>. It&rsquo;s pretty pointless if a cell has multiple icons of the same type. (With the exception of a few icons for which the placement matters.)</p><p>Secondly, <strong>terraforming types should flood fill</strong>. What does that mean? Well,</p><ul><li>While the board is still empty, we place all terraforming squares <em>first</em>.</li><li>For each one, we pick a few random starting locations, and then &ldquo;grow&rdquo; from there. (That&rsquo;s where <em>flood fill</em> comes from.)</li><li>This means we automatically create groups or chains of these types, which makes them more useful. (For example, the river scores for how <em>long</em> it is. If there are barely any river tiles next to other river tiles, then this whole square becomes pointless for that game.)</li></ul><p>I did make a distinction between <em>flood fill</em> (create a group going in all directions) and <em>chains</em> (more like a random walk through the board, with a clear beginning or end). Some types like the first one better, some the second.</p><p>Thirdly, I use a &ldquo;template&rdquo; when picking my random types that <em>could</em> appear on the board. In other words,</p><ul><li>It picks <em>one</em> random square for each main category (score, terraform, &mldr;)</li><li>Whatever space is left, is filled randomly.</li></ul><p>This ensures that the nice distribution of special powers actually comes through in the board. We never end up with a board that&rsquo;s only terraforming tiles, or that has no tiles that actually score points.</p><p>With all that done, I only have to set some thresholds for each type (their probability of appearing + a hard minimum or maximum, if needed), and generation is done.</p><h3 id=a-side-note-about-my-systems>A side note about my systems</h3><p>When I just started creating games on websites, I had no clue how to do it. I used the only framework I knew (and which seemed popular and well-supported), which was Phaser.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why, for all these years, the Phaser framework was built into all those &ldquo;random board generators&rdquo; I coded.</p><ul><li>Every single one of those games had to <em>load</em> the entire library, which is easily a few megabytes.</li><li>I had to work around the limitations and unsupported features all the time.</li><li>While requiring glue code to &ldquo;plug&rdquo; my generated board into a Phaser instance to draw it.</li></ul><p>It was just overkill, and messy, and slow. Since then, I&rsquo;ve created my own functions and systems for drawing and generating stuff on the web.</p><p>For months now, I&rsquo;ve slowly been switching over.</p><p>First, I replaced all direct calls to phaser (<code>this.game.dosomething</code>) with a layer in between (<code>imageToPhaser(imageResource)</code>). This layer decoupled my systems and let me see if my ideas worked or where I needed to find a cleaner API. Many of the older games already use this.</p><p>With this game, I&rsquo;ve finally made the second step (for the first time): Phaser isn&rsquo;t involved at all and I use my own code directly, on a blank canvas. This was easy to do now, because I already decoupled the systems and could just replace that &ldquo;middle-layer&rdquo; with direct calls to my own system.</p><p>To my players/visitors, there&rsquo;s no difference, except a significant speed upgrade.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>Although, in some cases it became considerably slower. So there&rsquo;s probably some stupid unoptimized thing I&rsquo;m doing at the moment.</p></aside><p>But the code for this game is <em>much</em> simpler and cleaner behind the scenes.</p><p>Writing this entire section might seem overkill for such a simple change in my code. But that&rsquo;s the downside of creating things for a long time, which are supposed to <em>exist</em> for a long time: you accumulate technical baggage.</p><p>If I were to start now, I obviously wouldn&rsquo;t have used Phaser and wouldn&rsquo;t have integrated it so tightly (into my website) that I was barely able to get rid of it. But I didn&rsquo;t start now: I started ten years ago and still have projects from that period that need to stay working.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why my website can basically be divided into three parts.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;The previous system&rdquo;: whatever is needed to support an older, worse system I used.</li><li>&ldquo;Middle layer&rdquo;: temporary solutions to transition to the new system.</li><li>&ldquo;The new system&rdquo;: my current, best, most modern solution used in the most recent projects</li></ul><p>No matter how many times I upgrade the website and improve as a programmer, this division <em>persists</em>. Because once you&rsquo;ve made that better system &mldr; you already see the flaws, or have a new project with <em>different</em> requirements, and the cycle repeats.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>This also means you should send me an email if you find something broken in my games. There&rsquo;s a good chance it broke because of a minor upgrade to a better API behind the scenes&mdash;which means I have no clue this one tiny thing broke, but also that it&rsquo;s easily fixable.</p></aside><h3 id=a-note-about-board-legibility>A note about board legibility</h3><p>One of the recurring challenges with One Paper Games is the fact that, well, we only have <em>one paper</em>. It&rsquo;s hard to keep things legible and easy to parse, let alone <em>good looking</em>, at such small sizes or cramped spaces.</p><p>As such, the following cycle repeated itself several times.</p><ul><li>Let&rsquo;s see what the boards look like now.</li><li>Ugh. Don&rsquo;t like this. The icons have too little contrast and fade into the background, while the rest of the paper is one solid color.</li><li>Let&rsquo;s add some more details/texture to the board, and let&rsquo;s add a thicker outline/shadow around the icons!</li></ul><p>For example, look at one of these very early boards. I tried to make the background almost entirely <em>dark</em>, just to make the icons stand out more. (Needless to say, this didn&rsquo;t look great <em>and</em> it would&rsquo;ve been murder on your ink cartridges.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=mist_board_early_version.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Also, yes, I still used the sidebar image from Magnetman as I hadn&rsquo;t replaced it with the Mist one yet." title="Also, yes, I still used the sidebar image from Magnetman as I hadn&rsquo;t replaced it with the Mist one yet." width=1206 height=845></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Also, yes, I still used the sidebar image from Magnetman as I hadn&rsquo;t replaced it with the Mist one yet.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>Now compare that to the (mostly final) version. It has bright colors. The icons have a <em>much</em> thicker outline and shadow to make them pop. (I also increased contrast and brightness for many of them, with a filter of the same name in my graphics software.)</p><p>There&rsquo;s a slight <em>world map</em> texture behind the whole thing, just enough to make it look way more polished. Such polishing steps always take way longer than I want, but they do pay off in the end.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=mist_board_later_version.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="I&rsquo;ll still simplify some of the icons, because they&rsquo;re just too detailed when displayed so small, especially if you want an even larger board than this." title="I&rsquo;ll still simplify some of the icons, because they&rsquo;re just too detailed when displayed so small, especially if you want an even larger board than this." width=1198 height=845></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>I&rsquo;ll still simplify some of the icons, because they&rsquo;re just too detailed when displayed so small, especially if you want an even larger board than this.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=playtesting>Playtesting</h2><p>So I created some boards, printed them, and tested the game.</p><p>The results? As always, <strong>some good stuff, some bad stuff</strong>.</p><p>The good thing is that the game, in general, works and is very easy to teach and play.</p><p>The bad thing is that it&rsquo;s not great at the moment.</p><p>Below is an image of the very first test game.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=mist_first_playtest.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="There were 3 players. All the notes scribbled around were my own ideas, feedback, potential solutions, etcetera written after the game." title="There were 3 players.

All the notes scribbled around were my own ideas, feedback, potential solutions, etcetera written <em>after</em> the game.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=problem-1>Problem 1</h3><p><strong>Problem 1: Too much freedom.</strong> You can always walk to any (free) adjacent square. This means that players quickly learn to just &ldquo;snake&rdquo; across the board: you move to the other players as quickly as possible to &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; your chunk of the board. Once done, you just finish the game by collecting all squares in your chunk (which nobody else can reach).</p><p>This is the most boring and predictable way the game could play out. It makes the choice of which icon you pick somewhat irrelevant, because each square usually has 2 or 3 &ldquo;fine&rdquo; choices, and you can move anywhere anyway!</p><p><strong>Solution 1: You must move in the direction of the icon you chose.</strong> As stated earlier, I was already playing around with this idea. But I prefer more loose/free rules for a first prototype&mdash;if they work, they are simpler, if they don&rsquo;t work, I can always try the stricter rule <em>later</em>.</p><p>With this rule, you can&rsquo;t move around willy-nilly. You have to <em>choose</em> between &ldquo;is picking this icon worth more than potentially getting myself stuck when moving that way?&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t have everything, because the icon you pick also determines the way you must go.</p><p>Another nicety is that this doesn&rsquo;t <em>add</em> rules, it merely <em>changes</em> one line.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Move to any free, adjacent square.&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Move in the direction of the icon you picked.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3 id=problem-2>Problem 2</h3><p><strong>Problem 2: Starting locations.</strong> Once players realize the power of <em>cutting off other players</em>, the most strategical move is to start <em>really close</em> to another player. So you can instantly cut them off and limit their movement for the entire game.</p><p>This is obviously annoying and not fun at all. The game works best when players have equally spread out starting positions.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Add predetermined starting locations.</strong> Pick 6 squares with the same distance to the edge and minimum distance between each other. Mark them with some icon / glow / effect.</p><p>Again, this is nice because it doesn&rsquo;t <em>add</em> more rules, it only <em>changes</em>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Start at any free edge square.&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Start at any square marked with SOME ICON.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3 id=problem-3>Problem 3</h3><p><strong>Problem 3: Getting stuck is too easy.</strong> Especially with the new movement rule, it can happen that you get stuck rather quickly &mldr; and you just can&rsquo;t help it. That&rsquo;s no fun, being out of the game after 5 turns.</p><p>I foresaw this problem and had already added several special types that play with your movement. They were too weak, however, and sometimes negative (they restrict you <em>further</em> instead of helping!)</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Better move helper squares.</strong> I changed these squares and made sure at least one always appears.</p><p>For example, take the <strong>signpost</strong>.</p><ul><li>OLD POWER: &ldquo;Worth +3 points, but only pickable if you move in its direction.&rdquo;</li><li>NEW POWER: &ldquo;Worth -3 points. When you move, you may start from <em>any</em> square on your trail.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>The old power became worthless, now that &ldquo;you must move in the direction of your picked icon&rdquo; is a core rule. The old power was also <em>restricting</em>, so players only picked it when it happened to be fine. (Otherwise, the point reward wasn&rsquo;t high enough.)</p><p>The new power actually helps you get unstuck, albeit at a prize (to not make it overpowered).</p><h3 id=problem-4>Problem 4</h3><p><strong>Problem 4: Some special powers unbalanced (or badly explained).</strong> This always happens, but I&rsquo;ll mention it anyway. Some powers were too powerful. Others were so weak they were never picked.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Obviously, smarter powers.</strong></p><p>As you&rsquo;ve seen by now, the biggest issue was <em>movement</em>. The players need enough variety of movement to get unstuck or take strategic paths, as that makes the game way more challenging and interesting.</p><p>Hence, while playtesting, I mostly realized better <em>movement</em> powers I wanted to add.</p><ul><li><strong>Wrapping:</strong> &ldquo;Worth -10 points. If owned, you may <strong>wrap</strong> around the board. (Exiting at one edge makes you reappear at the opposite edge.)&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Multipick</strong>: &ldquo;Worth -20 points. If owned, you may pick <strong>two</strong> options from each location.&rdquo; (Which, consequently, gives you two directions in which you may travel.)</li><li><strong>Bargain</strong>: &ldquo;When picked, destroy 3 icons on your trail, then move to <em>any</em> free square.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Freedom</strong>: &ldquo;Worth -1 points. When picked, you may move in <em>any</em> direction.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>All of these require a sacrifice (which may or may not be worth it) to open up your options on the coming turns. Much more interesting than some of the current powers.</p><p>I added more negative squares in general. With our new core rule, they are much more useful, because sometimes you&rsquo;ll be forced to pick them because you want to move in that direction.</p><p>And then it&rsquo;s just tweaking numbers. Small changes in probability, in how often something can appear (at least / at most), in how many points it&rsquo;s worth.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll give one final example. The <strong>diamond</strong> is worth as many points as the number of diamonds you have. This is a simple (common) rule that rewards going all-in: the points quickly multiply into something huge once you gather more and more diamonds. (But having &lt;4 diamonds is worth almost nothing.)</p><p>Well, my playtests showed that there were currently too many diamonds :p So, in most games, at least 2 or 3 players scored 50+ points from diamonds alone.</p><p>So, I lower its probability, and I lower the &ldquo;maximum number&rdquo; of them that can appear.</p><p>Repeating this process for all types, a few times, usually gets us near the ideal balance for each.</p><h3 id=anything-else>Anything else?</h3><p>There were some further suggestions.</p><p>For example, a core rule that would say &ldquo;remove any 2 icons from your trail (so far), to teleport to anywhere&rdquo;. It would allow you to always get unstuck, until the board is pretty much filled at the end of the game.</p><p>While it&rsquo;d probably be fine &mldr; I just don&rsquo;t want to add another core rule. I prefer solving issues by being smart with the random generation and the special powers, and I think I did so now with the changes outlined above.</p><p>It&rsquo;s quite common that a bunch of similar rules are then suggested during playtesting, such as &ldquo;oh but what if you say: if your square only HAS 1 option, you may move ANYWHERE?&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, again, it sounds like good rule. It balances the lack of choice by adding more movement freedom. But it&rsquo;s <em>an extra rule</em> (for a very slight benefit).</p><p>In the end, I decided not to choose any of these options.</p><p>I did make loads of other small tweaks.</p><p>For example, with the new rule, icons pointing <em>out of the board</em> are pretty pointless (unless you have one of those special squares that allows special movement!) As such, the generator prefers placing icons in such a way that most of them point inwards, away from the edge.</p><p>The expert set introduces the fact that squares can be an ITEM or a HAZARD, but only a few of them actually <em>used</em> that. So I raised that number.</p><p>Due to a mistake in drawing order, some lines were thicker than others, which made the board like slightly messy.</p><p>Stuff like that.</p><h2 id=finishing>Finishing</h2><p>With all these changes, the game plays much better!</p><p>Even after all these games I&rsquo;ve made, it remains very tough to make meaningful changes and balance a game. Sometimes I do a playtest and everybody barely manages to get points &mldr; but I can clearly point out several dumb moves, so is it a flaw in the game? Or did everybody just play badly?</p><p>The fact that these One Paper Games are <em>randomly generated</em> makes it even worse. Was this game slightly more frustrating because of the rules, or just because this combination of powers + starting positions + players meant slightly less options for what to do?</p><p>I test as much as I can. I tweak based on experience and instinct. I improve the game for several iterations.</p><p>But then I just have to call it done. So this game is <em>done</em>!</p><p>(Though, as always, the <em>advantage</em> of randomly generated games on a website is that they are never &ldquo;done&rdquo;. I can always come back and improve, fix bugs, handle feedback, etcetera. In fact, many of my board games are done at least 6+ months before I planned to publish them, so I have plenty of time to come back later if I come up with some better rule or special power :p)</p><p>The game works, it&rsquo;s quick, it&rsquo;s extremely simple, it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s different every time, and it looks pretty good.</p><p>I&rsquo;m calling The Mist finished.</p><p>Until the next devlog, keep playing,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/librarians/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-6" style=--rotation:0deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/magnetmen/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-2" style=--rotation:1deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
