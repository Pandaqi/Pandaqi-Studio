It will be a rather <em>short</em> devlog (relatively speaking, at least), because this was a very small project that I basically made &ldquo;on the side&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to make games even simpler and more accessible.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how the following idea popped into my head.</p><ul><li>What if the paper was just a grid of icons &mldr;</li><li>And on each turn you do the same simple thing: cross off one icon to get it.</li><li>And at the end you sum all icons you collected for your score?</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;d be a <em>really</em> simple game. In fact, I just explained the whole game to you.</p><p>Of course, it also wouldn&rsquo;t be that interesting or tactical.</p><p>I knew I needed <em>some</em> limitation on which icons you could grab. That&rsquo;s how the following rule came to life:</p><blockquote><p>The more you have (of a particular icon), the more it <strong>repels</strong> you.</p></blockquote><p>In other words,</p><ul><li>If you have 1 icon, you can&rsquo;t pick horizontally next to that type anymore.</li><li>If you have 2 icons, you can&rsquo;t pick vertically next to that type anymore.</li><li>If you have 3 icons (or more), you can&rsquo;t pick any square next to that type in any way.</li></ul><p>In my mind&mdash;before testing the game yet&mdash;this seemed like a good rule.</p><p>As the game progresses, more and more parts of the board get closed off for <em>you</em>. This is easy to check and to execute. (I can add a graphic to the board that instantly <em>shows</em> you when each direction is forbidden, kind of like a compass.)</p><p>Yet it requires you to plan in advance. To make sure you can still grab valuable squares <em>later</em> and don&rsquo;t get stuck too early.</p><p>When I considered a <em>name</em> and <em>title</em> for this game, that idea of <em>repelling</em> kept coming back. That&rsquo;s the most intuitive way to explain the core mechanic. So I wrote down: &ldquo;<strong>Magnetmen?</strong>&rdquo; and went to bed.</p><h2 id=no-time-to-think-lets-make-it>No time to think, let&rsquo;s make it</h2><h3 id=graphics>Graphics</h3><p>Initially, I wasn&rsquo;t stoked about that name and theme. But it fits. And it&rsquo;s something <em>different</em> from what I&rsquo;d usually do. (My gut usually jumps to cute animals or food for themes :p)</p><p>So I decided not to waste any more time and just make it.</p><p>I immediately jumped to creating all icons using the latest image generation AI. Why?</p><ul><li>I knew I only needed a few icons for the whole game, which is doable with my low amount of free credits ;)</li><li>Those AIs are <em>awesome</em> at creating images based on real-life materials and objects. (Which also does not infringe on any copyright.)</li></ul><p>I can ask for a &ldquo;boy playing the guitar, made of metal parts and magnets&rdquo;, and it <em>usually</em> gives me that without so much as a pause. I created a list of common occupations and ran through them all to get ~30 different icons.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>I always create more illustrations than I need. Because some of them are always better than others&mdash;higher quality, more consistent style, funnier&mdash;and I want to be able to pick the best of the best. I already knew the final game only needed about ~20.</p></aside><p>As this was supposed to be a quick, tiny project, I accepted the styles I received and did minimal editing. (Just removing some ugly parts, adding a bit more color to dull ones, removing the background of course, etcetera.)</p><h3 id=board>Board</h3><p>This game is so simple that I want <em>all</em> the rules <em>on the page</em>. I already did this a few times before and learned from those attempts.</p><ul><li>The page is split in two parts: the actual playing board (the largest) and a &ldquo;sidebar&rdquo; (a vertical strip on the side)</li><li>The board is filled with a grid of random icons.</li><li>Around this board are strips of empty squares: the player &ldquo;inventories&rdquo;. This is where you draw each icon you collect.</li><li>The sidebar contains &mldr;<ul><li>A general tutorial. (What to do on your turn, when the game ends, etcetera.)</li><li>The explanations of every <em>specific</em> icon used on <em>this specific board</em>. (Their illustration + a sentence about how they score points.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Below is a quick sketch of this idea.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=board_sketch_v1.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Very rough sketch, of course. Doesn&rsquo;t even have the grid itself." title="Very rough sketch, of course. Doesn&rsquo;t even have the grid itself." width=1754 height=1240></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Very rough sketch, of course. Doesn&rsquo;t even have the grid itself.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>In the final generation I always make the dimensions of things <em>dynamic</em>, so the size of the board/tutorial/inventories can change on the fly as we go.</p><p>The biggest challenge is always to get enough <em>space</em> for the tutorial, even when we include many icons.</p><h3 id=wait-a-minute-i-had-more-rules>Wait a minute, I had more rules!</h3><p>I started making this so quickly, that I completely forgot about two other rules I wrote down. (I was only reminded of these when I went to close my notes before going to bed.)</p><p><strong>Rule 1: Encircling.</strong> If you manage to completely <em>enclose</em> a group of icons on all sides (with your move), then you get <em>the whole group</em>. (Similar to something like Go.)</p><p><strong>Rule 2: Must pick adjacent.</strong> On your turn, you must pick a square adjacent to a square that&rsquo;s already been used.</p><p>And I can see why my brain decided to subconsciously ignore these.</p><p>First of all, they don&rsquo;t fit on the page. If one or both of these had to be added to the explanation, it would become too long.</p><p>But secondly, they have all sorts of nasty side-effects that would overcomplicate the game (and lead to more needed rules). For example,</p><ul><li>What if you enclose a particularly large group? The player inventories are quite small, so it probably won&rsquo;t fit.</li><li>What if a player decides to be annoying and start in a corner? This limits the options for other players so severely, for the entire game, that it basically ruins the game => we&rsquo;d need extra rules about where you&rsquo;re allowed to start (to make that &ldquo;must pick adjacent&rdquo;-rule work)</li><li>The Repel rule is already interesting and limits placement. The Adjacency requirement would be so limiting that you&rsquo;re likely out of the game before it has even started.</li></ul><p>They are still <em>good rules</em>, just not for this game. So I moved them to a future One Paper Game which would focus entirely on encircling.</p><h2 id=the-final-boards>The final boards</h2><p>So, I wrote the code to randomly generate all these parts and draw them on the page.</p><p>The icon picker uses my own system for &ldquo;balanced randomness&rdquo; behind the scenes.</p><ul><li>It picks a <em>subset</em> of all possible icons. (If you use more than 6 or 7 unique icons, it&rsquo;d just be overwhelming.)</li><li>Then randomly fills all the squares.</li><li>While keeping requirements into account. (For example, some type can&rsquo;t appear more than X times, another type can&rsquo;t appear next to type Y, etcetera.)</li></ul><p>I also added an &ldquo;Evaluator&rdquo; at the end of that chain (as always), which checks if the final board is valid and has no nastiness. As of right now, though, it does nothing because I don&rsquo;t see any potential issues.</p><p>For now, there is no other decoration. Just solid rectangles and images, which looks as follows:</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=magnetmen_generated_board.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="I usually make things prettier or add random decorations over time, often even after a game is &ldquo;finished&rdquo;." title="I usually make things prettier or add random decorations over time, often even after a game is &ldquo;finished&rdquo;." width=1024 height=724></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>I usually make things prettier or add random decorations over time, often even after a game is &ldquo;finished&rdquo;.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>Notice the little drawings in the corner of the tutorial icons. Those are for <em>drawing</em> them yourself, in your inventory. (You can&rsquo;t expect people to draw those complicated icons every time :p) They might still be too complex right now&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see about that.</p><p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t see too many issues here.</p><ul><li>The board might receive more variation. Slightly different background colors behind the icons, for example.</li><li>The tutorial is similarly barebones. Perhaps decorate the headings and add some magnets here and there.</li><li>(And of course the &ldquo;ink friendly&rdquo; variant that uses less ink.)</li><li>But otherwise, <em>this is the game</em>.</li></ul><p>So I quickly printed a few of these and tested the game.</p><h2 id=playtesting--finishing>Playtesting & Finishing</h2><h3 id=initial-playtests-2-players>Initial Playtests (2 players)</h3><p>Due to some last-minute issues (with scheduling), I initially tested the game with 2 players only.</p><p>Below is an image of two of those papers. (With some quick notes by me as I try to improve the rules, which I&rsquo;ll explain below.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=magnetmen_2_player_games.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="As usual, sorry for bad lighting and terrible smartphone camera.

Though I did recently&mdash;finally&mdash;get a brighter light in my workspace.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>The results?</p><p><strong>The game works!</strong></p><ul><li>The rules are indeed explained within 30 seconds.</li><li>The magnet rule clearly locks down the board over time, but not so much that you can have games where you are done after 2 moves.</li><li>The different ways that squares score is easy to explain, read and use.</li></ul><p>At the very first playtest, we realized some practical consequence of this rule: <strong>once you have one of each type in the game, you can literally not pick any more squares</strong>. I never even realized this before now, but when playing this jumped out immediately. Because me and my opponent had both collected the 5 unique types, almost out of &ldquo;gamer&rsquo;s habit&rdquo;, and realized we&rsquo;d been stupid.</p><p>The next game we played, we scored double the points and got way further.</p><p>The game clearly pushes you to go for <em>one or two types</em>. The challenge of this game, therefore, is about quickly identifying which are the best ones to go for (for you specifically). And, of course, hoping that others don&rsquo;t see how many points that will score you and interfere with that plan.</p><aside class="example masked-link-block"><span class=label>Example ||</span><p>One game, I noticed that my opponent could only grab 1 explorer, while I could grab 4 (based on the current inventory situations). The explorer scores +4 points <em>if you have the most</em>, otherwise -4.</p><p>As such, I waited as long as I could to see if my opponent would go for that 1 explorer. They didn&rsquo;t&mdash;the smart move by them. So then I grabbed the 4 explorers, scored 16 points, and narrowly won the game.</p><p>All of this was made possible by the simplicity of the game, how far you can look ahead, and how your early choices change the last half of te game.</p></aside><p>Another consequence of this, of course, is that games with <em>more different types</em> go on a little longer and are slightly easier to play. If your board only has 5 types, then you will collect 2 or 3 of a type much earlier, and thus be done earlier. If you have 7 or 8 possible types, they appear far less, and it takes longer before you even have &ldquo;one of each type&rdquo;.</p><p>All of these little ideas about strategy are automatically <em>learned</em> while playing it, which is great. It means the game, whilst far from being &ldquo;deep&rdquo; or &ldquo;complex&rdquo;, certainly does have depth and replayability.</p><h3 id=my-issues>My issues</h3><p>My only <strong>critique</strong>, really, was the low amount of interaction and how quickly your choices dwindle.</p><ul><li>The Repel rule only applies to <em>you</em>. So you can&rsquo;t make it harder to grab something for opponents&mdash;you can only obstruct them by picking the exact square they want for yourself.</li><li>Squares that have been &ldquo;picked&rdquo; are still on the board, so even that doesn&rsquo;t change much.</li></ul><p>I played with the idea of squares, once picked, being completely <em>removed</em> from play. As in, they also don&rsquo;t count when checking the Repel rule.</p><p>This, however, didn&rsquo;t feel great initially.</p><ul><li>It required adding a sentence or two to the rules explanation.</li><li>It probably added too <em>much</em> freedom as the game goes on.</li></ul><p>I considered splitting the core rule of the game into <em>two</em> options.</p><p>On your turn, pick an unpicked icon.</p><ul><li>Either cross it out and add it to your collection.</li><li>OR fully destroy it. (You don&rsquo;t get it; it&rsquo;s just gone from the board.)</li></ul><p>This would provide a balance between actually removing squares from the board (or stealing them from opponents), and collecting them so you can score them.</p><p>It would also complicate the rules explanation.</p><p>The more I considered this, the more it felt like a <em>variation</em> on the rules for those who wanted a little more out of this game. (And a little more cutthroat player interaction. Which, if you know me, is <em>always</em> my goal.)</p><p>If I were to make these rules the core, I&rsquo;d lose the one thing Magnetmen was made to do: be the most accessible game ever, take it with you anywhere and play with anyone within 30 seconds.</p><p>So this was my solution:</p><ul><li>The rules remain the same for the base set. However, I change the rules for one type to be the &ldquo;destroyer&rdquo;, and always include this one.<ul><li>&ldquo;Worth 0 points. When picked, <strong>destroy</strong> 2 squares. (Make it unrecognizable to signal it&rsquo;s removed from the board.)&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>But when you pick a more advanced set, the new rules image is displayed.<ul><li>In other words, destroying becomes a core part of the game.</li><li>At this point, I can be sure people have already tried the game at least once and are, you know, ready for 1 more rule.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=playtesting-the-slightly-tweaked-system>Playtesting the slightly tweaked system</h3><p>Some time later, I was finally able to test with more players, and with the new rules / advanced sets.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to test all types and configurations, but that&rsquo;s almost always the case with these randomly generated OPGs.</p><p>As I expected, the game just became <em>(slightly) better</em>. You play for slightly longer, with more options, and there&rsquo;s more interaction as the board changes all the time. There is slightly more strategy and challenge. The powers connected to the icons are now a bit smarter (based on my experience playtesting), which means it&rsquo;s harder to pick the best strategy on a new board, even after playing several games already.</p><aside class="example masked-link-block"><span class=label>Example ||</span><p>I specifically modified powers/rules so that it&rsquo;s not the best strategy &ldquo;almost 100% of the time&rdquo; to go for as many as possible of the same type, before considering another type. Some powers place a cap on how much you will reasonably want. Sometimes very explicitly, such as the judge that wants to be picked exactly once, otherwise it means negative points.</p><p>The fact that you <em>must</em> keep taking turns as long as you can</p></aside><p>That&rsquo;s enough for me.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>As usual with One Paper Games, the game doesn&rsquo;t have huge depth or crazy mechanics that will blow your mind. Instead, the depth matches the simplicity. For such simple rules and instant play, the depth and &ldquo;replayability&rdquo; of the game match, in my eyes at least.</p><p>The idea is that you can print 10 Magnetmen papers and play some quick fun games anywhere, with anyone, with no hurdles or obstacles or unnecessary complexity. I think we&rsquo;ve achieved that!</p><p>Also, my laptop is <em>really</em> at the end of its life. Even the simplest changes (in terms of code or graphics) can take minutes, or cause a crash, which means I basically rushed to finish this project before it all imploded.</p><p>So, to finish it off, a screenshot of the generated &ldquo;Magnetmen&rdquo; that did <strong>not</strong> make it into the game. (Adding another set seemed overkill anyway, but it would literally have killed my computer I think. Also, I decided that a game about Magnet people should probably not include animals. Still, I wanted to show these <em>somewhere</em>, because they were quite nice.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=unused_magnetmen.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="A screenshot of some unused Magnetmen.
