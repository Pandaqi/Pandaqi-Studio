It&rsquo;s part of the Luck Legends series, so visit that general devlog for a high-overview of every game and what the project is. This devlog will (briefly!) discuss the process and other interesting stories for this particular game.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>Dice rolling games, or &ldquo;compare numbers games&rdquo; in general, have the issue of highest numbers always being better. Or, in some of my own games, the &ldquo;extreme numbers&rdquo; (highest or lowest) being better. If you&rsquo;re just lucky with your cards/dice, you have a much easier, maybe even boring game.</p><p>As such, most of those games have one or two &ldquo;twists&rdquo; to combat this. Best case scenario? You can actually <em>use</em> this inherent randomness or unfairness to make the game more fun.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what I sought to do with this simple twist: instead of numbers on your &ldquo;die&rdquo;, you have animals. And those animals have a &ldquo;rock, paper, scissors&rdquo; type relationship, like a cycle saying &ldquo;Animal A > Animal B > Animal C > Animal A again&rdquo;.</p><p>The basic idea was as follows.</p><ul><li>All players get 6 cards with animals: their &ldquo;die&rdquo;. (To &ldquo;roll&rdquo; it, simply shuffle and reveal a random card.)</li><li>On your turn,<ul><li>Pick a Zoo Card that shows this cycle (A > B > &mldr;)</li><li>Pick an opponent to battle.</li><li>Both players roll their die.</li><li>Whoever rolled the &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; animal wins!</li></ul></li></ul><p>This is already a good start. Because of the cyclical relationships, no animal is inherently better or worse than another. Because you may <em>pick</em> one yourself (from a few available cards), you get more agency and tactics.</p><p>I started work on the project with just this snippet of an idea. Doing that work, and specifying the idea, revealed a few more issues though.</p><ul><li><strong>What&rsquo;s the objective?</strong> If you win the battle, you score the Zoo Card. (That seemed the simplest way to keep score without requiring extra material.)</li><li><strong>What if it&rsquo;s a tie?</strong> One player gets the zoo card, the other discards a card. Active player chooses. (Discarding a card might seem like a penalty, but it&rsquo;s actually a benefit. Because your die is smaller, you have far more certainty over the outcome of any roll!)</li><li><strong>How can we involve other players?</strong> I decided to create an <em>expansion</em> where, if a Zoo Card shows a &ldquo;people icon&rdquo;, <em>everyone</em> rolls. If it ends up with a 3-way tie (or more), the active player simply decides which players get <em>nothing</em>.</li><li>The game is called &ldquo;Lucky Lions&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>should Lions be special or something?</strong> No, I decided not to give <em>one</em> animal special properties or rules to remember. That would create the issue again where you could get lucky, start with more lions than anyone else, bla bla.<ul><li>Instead, I added another tiny expansion where <em>all</em> animals have special powers. Lions perhaps have the best one, but that&rsquo;s debatable. It&rsquo;s simple things like: re-roll once, if a tie I win, etcetera.</li><li>Those power texts, however, only appear on those expansion cards. This reduces the complexity of the game, because all the base game animals are still powerless. Only once in a while will you roll a &ldquo;special animal&rdquo;.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The biggest oversight by me, however, was that <strong>cylical relationships obviously have no &ldquo;winner&rdquo;</strong> :p</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Animal A > Animal B > Animal C > Animal A&rdquo;</p><p>One player rolls Animal B. The other rolls Animal A.</p><p>Well &mldr; Animal A > Animal B, but if we look further down the cycle, we see that Animal B &#187; Animal A too!</p><p>In Rock, Paper, Scissors this is fixed by having the relationship not being &ldquo;transitive&rdquo;. That is, only the two things directly compared matter. Animal B is <em>not</em> better than Animal A, because Animal C is in-between and breaks that up.</p><p>How do we explain this very simply to players? I surely don&rsquo;t want to use words like &ldquo;transitive&rdquo; or an entire paragraph explaining this or comparing it to Rock, Paper, Scissors. Instead, let&rsquo;s just focusing on &ldquo;gaps&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>The animal with the longest gap (on the cycle) to the other animal is the best.</p></blockquote><p>In our example, the gap between Animal B and Animal A (following the cycle) is 0. They&rsquo;re right after each other.</p><p>The gap between Animal A and Animal B (following the cycle) is 1. Animal C is between them (in cycle order / clockwise order).</p><p>When visualized on the card, as an actual circle, this is very intuitive and easy to check.</p><p>With that fixed, the idea was finalized</p><h2 id=lets-make-that>Let&rsquo;s make that!</h2><h3 id=generation>Generation</h3><p>The code for generating this material was slightly more complicated than I initially expected.</p><ul><li>The different zoo cards have different sizes for the cycle. (One card might have <em>all</em> animals on it, while another only has 3.)</li><li>We need to make sure that, overall, the animals are fairly distributed. But within the zoo card itself, it needs to match the cycle size and be random. (We don&rsquo;t want to accidentally generate cards where LION is <em>always</em> directly next to FOX.)</li></ul><p>That wasn&rsquo;t too bad, however. All the other code simply meant going through a loop and adding all the animals X times.</p><h3 id=drawing>Drawing</h3><p>I&rsquo;d picked the fonts for this game a week or so ago, because I just happened to stumble across perfect ones. As I&rsquo;ve stated many times before, locking in the fonts <em>early</em> helps a great deal. Now I know what numbers and text will look like, and I can design the rest of the card to match that.</p><p>I purposely picked the animals to have different colors. The &ldquo;missing&rdquo; colors were brown and (dark) green, so that I could use those for card background and decorations.</p><p>Combining all of that into simple card designs, we get the following.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=lucky_lions_sketches.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Had some issues with the orange text box on Animals. There&rsquo;s white in this sketch, but black text turned out more readable in the end." title="Had some issues with the orange text box on Animals.

There&rsquo;s white in this sketch, but black text turned out more readable in the end.</span></figcaption></figure></p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>I like minimalism in general. But I also find that having really involved or detailed visual designs for a really simple game &mldr; just sets completely the wrong expectations / makes the wrong promises. People will naturally assume the game is a bit more difficult or detailed. As such, the simpler the game, the simpler I try to keep every part of the visuals.</p></aside><h3 id=finalizing>Finalizing</h3><p>I kept the game simple and low in requirements. This meant there wasn&rsquo;t much &ldquo;finalizing&rdquo; to do, as there wasn&rsquo;t much to fix and I hadn&rsquo;t left a pile of work (such as drawing a lot of icons for the expansion) for myself in the future :p</p><p>The game worked immediately. Understanding how cycles work/explaining them to players takes just a few more seconds than I&rsquo;d like. But I&rsquo;m a perfectionist when it comes to making my games <em>absolutely as simple as possible</em>, and really, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. You can literally see which animal beats another, and you can see which has the biggest gap right on the card. Throw in &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like Rock, Paper, Scissors&rdquo; and everyone gets it.</p><p>Of course, that simplicity means there isn&rsquo;t a huge amount of depth or tactical change. But there&rsquo;s more than enough. I feel the balance here between randomness/risk and tactics/informed choices is good here.</p><ul><li>You get to choose your Zoo Card. (Go for a high-scoring one that you&rsquo;re unlikely to win? Or a low-scoring one you&rsquo;re more certain about?)</li><li>On ties, you get to choose how to resolve them. (Do I want points now? Or a less random/more certain dice?)</li><li>Over time, you get to see all the cards in the dice of other players, giving you more and more information to make tactical plays.</li><li>The two tiny expansions add extra spice and variety for those who want it, at very little cost.</li></ul><p>I will suppress my urge to overcomplicate the game.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the final material.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=lucky_lions_final.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Would&rsquo;ve liked text to be bigger, but there&rsquo;s just no space for that.

For games that are simple enough&mdash;and this one surely is&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t take much to completely simulate the gameplay. Then I can provide fun interactive examples to learn from (for now players), but I can also reuse that code to let the computer play 10,000 games and give me some results.</p><p>Those results?</p><ul><li><strong>Average number of turns per game is 3.</strong> (This is quite low because every turn is a <em>battle</em> between players, so you&rsquo;re also often losing/gaining cards on <em>other</em> player&rsquo;s turns. This actually feels like the perfect length for such a short/simple game.)</li><li><strong>Probability for Ties is ~25%.</strong> (This is fine too. Not too high, not too low. Especially because ties have an interesting rule for resolving them, I&rsquo;m fine with 1 out of 4 battles ending like that.)</li><li>On higher player counts, you could <strong>run out of Zoo Cards</strong> => I bumped up the number of Zoo Cards in the base game by 5 and this was completely gone.</li><li><strong>Average number of hand cards (when doing a battle) is 5.</strong> => This is fine too. Players are losing cards during the game, but not so many that they have only 1 or 2 left.</li><li><strong>Average number of zoo cards (at the end) is 3.</strong> => This is fine too. It means most players at least have a few Zoo Cards or are close to winning. (You need at least 4 to win, because you need 10 points and the max value per card is 3.)</li></ul><p>So, yeah, a nice confirmation that the game seems balanced (after fixing the issue of too few zoo cards).</p><p>I was mostly worried about the ties being too prominent. Because &ldquo;animals not on the cycle&rdquo; are all considered equal, and there are more than enough zoo cards with just 2 or 3 icons in the cycle (instead of all animals).</p><p>At first, this fear seemed correct: my simulation gave a 66% tie rate! Way too high! Fortunately, that was a bug :p</p><p>I had forgotten to implement the <em>second</em> part of that rule &ldquo;&mldr; but animals not on the cycle are always <em>worth less</em> than those that ARE on it&rdquo;.</p><p>For such simple games, these simulations are a nice bonus and reality check, but I mostly write that code for the <em>interactive example</em> in the rulebook.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>That&rsquo;s it! The second game for the Luck Legends done. I still love the Dice Deck mechanic as an alternative for dice rolls, so I&rsquo;ll try to get my other (slightly more involved) game ideas going quickly. (I have to take a break now to meet other deadlines, but will be back to boardgames in a few weeks, probably.)</p><p>Until the next devlog,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/the-luck-legends/project/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-7" style=--rotation:0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/the-luck-legends/folly-and-fortune/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-4" style=--rotation:-1.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
