The game is part of the <em>SwiftSmash Saga</em> collection, which is all about games where you simultaneously reveal cards and must then be the first to <em>smash</em> (or just tap/pick) the &ldquo;right card&rdquo;.</p><p>This devlog will be very short! I know, that&rsquo;s a rarity for me. I often promise that and always fail to keep it brief.</p><p>But this time I am certain, because the game is already done. In this devlog, I&rsquo;ll quickly guide you through the process of making the game, why I made certain (interesting) decisions, and then give my thoughts about the final result.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>Some time ago, I made <em>Cookie Smasher</em>. At the time, it was just an experiment and not planned to be a series.</p><p>When I finished that game, I had the usual thought: &ldquo;The game is fine, but now I know how to do it <em>better</em> and <em>simpler</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>I wrote down the general idea for <em>Smackshapes</em> (dubbed the &ldquo;Kids Version&rdquo; of Cookie Smasher back then). I saw that it would indeed be far simpler, and knew it would probably work. I was busy with other projects, however, so I dropped it for a year or so.</p><p>That version of the game was as follows.</p><ul><li>Cards show colored shapes. (These don&rsquo;t have to be the same: a card might show a red square and a green circle.)</li><li>Everyone plays a card at the same time. When revealed, you have to find the <strong>shape that appears the most</strong> (and smash a card with that shape)</li><li>If there&rsquo;s a tie for that, you must pick the <strong>color that appears the most</strong> (and smash a card with that color)</li><li>If still a tie, smash any of the winning cards.</li><li>(And PERHAPS the game would add <em>rules cards</em>: these would have a different rule for finding the &ldquo;winning card&rdquo; than the usual one I described above. If anyone played one of these, their rule would take precedence.)</li></ul><p>A fine idea, but not as streamlined as I&rsquo;d like. This didn&rsquo;t guarantee a <em>single</em> winning card. It did lead to <em>many ties</em>, which are hard to calculate for players (and not that interesting/fun). And the Rules cards would stop this from being a &ldquo;Kids Version&rdquo;, because it would require complicated text on the cards to explain each rule.</p><p>When I came back, the idea had simplified <em>even further</em> in my subconscious brain. It had come to this:</p><ul><li>Cards only have <strong>one color</strong> and <strong>one shape</strong>. (For example, &ldquo;2 red squares&rdquo; or &ldquo;3 green triangles&rdquo;)</li><li>Moreover, the number of them is <strong>unique</strong>. (There is only one card with 3 green triangles, never more.)</li><li>Moreover, each card shows a <strong>ranking</strong> of all shapes. (This can be done with icons and without text.)</li><li>This allows simplifying the core rules.<ul><li>The card from the start player shows the ranking. (Example: Square > Triangle > Circle.)</li><li><strong>Tap the card with the highest-ranking shape.</strong></li><li>If tied, tap the card with the <strong>most</strong> of them.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This <em>always</em> leads to a single winning card, without any bias. (Cards with a <em>high number</em>&mdash;a lot of shapes&mdash;don&rsquo;t necessarily win more often, because their shape might be on the low end of the random ranking.)</p><p>This also allows the game to function with only ~25 simple cards. They show no text, just basic shapes in basic colors.</p><p>In fact, you might notice that <em>colors</em> don&rsquo;t matter now. I briefly considered removing colors entirely and just making this the final game, but I decided against it.</p><ul><li>Those colored shapes are necessary to make the game look more vivid and, well, colorful.</li><li>These core rules are <em>so simple</em> that I really want to add an expansion that uses those colors and adds some spice.</li></ul><p>This expansion, as expected, uses the colors.</p><ul><li>My first thought was to bring back the old rule: &ldquo;In case of a tie, tap the color that appears the most.&rdquo; But, well, our game <em>has no ties</em> right now and I don&rsquo;t see why I would mess with that.</li><li>After some brainstorming, I found the simplest rule that does have massive consequences to gameplay: &ldquo;If <em>all colors are the same</em> (in a round), it <strong>inverts</strong>. You want to tap the lowest ranking shape and the lowest number.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>With that, the rules were a single page and the game worked well. Whatever people played, you will never immediately know the winning card, nor will it take you a minute to calculate.</p><h2 id=lets-make-that>Let&rsquo;s make that</h2><p>The code that generates the cards is nothing special.</p><ul><li>It simply loops through all shapes + all numbers allowed, then creates <em>one card</em> for each combo. (The numbers are between 1&ndash;9. Some of them, however, are reserved for the expansion. Because those cards should be unique too!)</li><li>It assigns colors randomly, but fairly. (Some colors might appear more often than others, but the difference is never larger than 1 or 2.)</li><li>The expansion also adds an action to the cards. This is randomly picked from a list of templates (like &ldquo;Ignore the color <code>%color%</code>&rdquo;), where the thing between percentage signs is <em>replaced</em> by a randomly picked color when drawing the card.</li></ul><p>Similarly, the visual design is nothing special. With Cookie Smasher, I entered a visual style for this series that is all about minimalism and giving cards a mostly solid (white) background. I won&rsquo;t do this for all games, but for the <em>absolute simplest of them all</em>, it felt fitting to use <em>the absolute simplest card design</em>.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>I&rsquo;ve spoken about this before. It sounds reasonable to think &ldquo;well the game is so simple, let&rsquo;s compensate/balance that with an intricate graphical design&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;ve experienced the opposite. This just sends the wrong message and the wrong expectations. Because of the design, people think it&rsquo;s a long and complicated game!</p><p>Additionally, it&rsquo;s hard to motivate myself when it takes 10x as long to draw the card design than it took to design <em>the entirety of the game</em>.</p></aside><p>Below are my quick sketches and notes on the design.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=smackshapes_sketch.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The exact sizes and positions of things are never set in stone; I&rsquo;ll finetune that when the generator is making the cards." title="The exact sizes and positions of things are never set in stone; I&rsquo;ll finetune that when the generator is making the cards." width=1372 height=785></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>The exact sizes and positions of things are never set in stone; I&rsquo;ll finetune that when the generator is making the cards.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>I used simple pencil brush strokes to mark some boxes. I used basic shapes, but with that pencil <em>outline</em> again to set them apart.</p><p>Then, in code,</p><ul><li>I <em>tint</em> the shapes to represent the color of the card. (The original shapes are just white with a black outline, but with a simple effect I can make that any color. Because tinting always makes things <em>darker</em>, a black outline is preferred here&mdash;it will just stay black and keep the look consistent.)</li><li>I manually picked the positions of the cards where shapes can appear. For each card, it just randomly picks from that list and draws the shapes at those locations.</li><li>(When an action is present, it&rsquo;s forbidden from picking positions low on the card, which are all past the halfway point of that list.)</li></ul><p>I drew this one night, I implemented it two days later (when I finally could go back to using my laptop), and &mldr; well, nothing special to say.</p><p>My only &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; was the size of the ranking at the top. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be larger? It&rsquo;s such a crucial element to each round!</p><p>Then I tried it and realized that, no, this design is fine. That ranking only matters on the <em>card played by the start player</em>. While the shapes + colors of a card <em>always matter</em>. So those should still be most prominent and easy to read.</p><p>Moreover, different people might have different strategies&mdash;some check the ranking first, others count shapes/colors first and <em>then</em> look at the ranking, etcetera. For some the ranking has &ldquo;highest priority&rdquo;, for some &ldquo;lowest&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s great! Diversity in strategy is always good. I don&rsquo;t want to ruin that by making the ranking so large you can&rsquo;t help but start by seeing it.</p><p>This means the final material looks as follows.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=smackshapes_final.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Please remember I always compress my images quite heavily, to keep my (free) website fast and light. The real material is never as slightly pixelated/blurry as these screenshots.

With some slight tweaking, and a simple and clear (textless) design, the game just works. And I stop there to prevent myself from overthinking or overcomplicating it.</p><p>The rules should be teachable to <em>anyone</em> and <em>any group</em>. It&rsquo;s fast to play and anyone can win, but being the first to smash the right card is still hard to do every time. I think it nicely finds the balance between making players think <em>oh that&rsquo;s easy</em>, but then turning out <em>a little more challenging</em> as they play.</p><p>As such, right now, this game is firmly in the spot of &ldquo;simplest SwiftSmash game&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t see anything dislodging it.</p><p>Until the next devlog,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/swiftsmash-saga/cookie-smasher/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-5" style=--rotation:0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/swiftsmash-saga/racesmack/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-3" style=--rotation:0.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
