The original idea, what problems I encountered, why I made certain decisions, and so forth.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>I have currently ranked my game ideas based on how &ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast&rdquo; they are to make. After years of making games, this has turned out to be the most useful ranking. Whenever I am ready to start the next project, I simply pick the game at the top of this list. (Which will be, roughly, the smallest and simplest idea I have.)</p><p>This was a relatively recent idea that quickly shot to the top of that list.</p><p>I asked myselF: &ldquo;could I make a game in which your only action is just to <em>flip a tile</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>I wrote down a few quick ideas for rulesets, but none really felt like a game with any depth.</p><ul><li>If it&rsquo;s just about memorizing the best tiles, then it&rsquo;s just your basic memory game.</li><li>If I want the tile to have varying powers or values (to different players), then we need <em>more rules</em> to make that happen. (For example, I considered making the tiles <em>soldiers</em> and you created your best army to defend yourself by flipping the tiles you did or didn&rsquo;t want.)</li><li>If it&rsquo;s so important to know or reveal what&rsquo;s on tiles, then after a few turns, the entire board will simply be faceup and the whole idea useless!</li></ul><p>It took a while before I found a clean, simple &ldquo;game loop&rdquo; for this game.</p><ul><li>Tiles have a POINT VALUE and one or two actions: HEART or SKULL.</li><li>A heart action triggers when you flip a tile <em>faceup</em> (it is &ldquo;born&rdquo;).</li><li>A skull action triggers when you flip a tile <em>facedown</em> (it &ldquo;dies&rdquo;).</li><li>Scoring a tile means placing it before you and scoring its points at the end of the game.</li></ul><p>Because of the different actions, players have reasons to flip tiles both ways. Moreover, the heart action (which you have to do from <em>memory</em>) is always more powerful than the skull one. So it becomes only <em>partially</em> a memory game.</p><p>But the decoupling of the tile itself and &ldquo;scoring&rdquo; also was a Eureka moment.</p><p>If you simply scored tiles by flipping them, then you could remember the best tiles and then just &mldr; grab those. Not that interesting. Person with best memory (or attention span) wins :p (And if you played the game a few times, you&rsquo;d also know all the tiles in the game by heart and it would be even more boring.)</p><p>Instead, flipping a tile just means taking its <em>action</em>, not necessarily scoring it. Scoring is simply the most common action, but it always has specific conditions. For example, &ldquo;score an adjacent tile&rdquo; or &ldquo;score a tile in the same row&rdquo;.</p><p>The thing that finished the idea to me&mdash;which meant I could start this devlog and start prototyping&mdash;was one final rule: &ldquo;you can only score facedown tiles&rdquo;.</p><p>This turned the gameplay into something like this:</p><ul><li>Find which tiles you want.</li><li>Make sure they are facedown on your turn.</li><li>So you can flip the right tile to score them.</li></ul><p>Despite the extremely simple and consistent ruleset, this already leads to a tough challenge and lots of variation in strategy. At least, that&rsquo;s what I imagined.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s create a paper prototype and see.</p><h2 id=lessons-from-the-prototype>Lessons from the Prototype</h2><h3 id=preparing-the-material>Preparing the material</h3><p>When creating a paper prototype, I obviously have to make decision about what material to include.</p><ul><li>What are the min/max point values of tiles? How often do they occur?</li><li>What are the actions and how do I represent them?</li><li>Etcetera</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve learned to just come up with any random &ldquo;rule&rdquo; (that sounds sensible) to follow here. It&rsquo;s the very first prototype&mdash;an educated guess is the best we can do.</p><p>So, in this case, I decided to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Include both positive and negative point values in equal measures (also including 0 tiles)</li><li>Add 4 tiles for values below 4: 2 with both actions, 1 with only HEART, 1 with only SKULL.</li><li>Add 2 tiles for larger values (4, 5, 6): all with both actions</li><li>Mostly add skull actions that give <em>information</em>. (As that gives you a clear idea of what to do on your turn.)</li><li>Which means the heart actions are for <em>scoring</em> and &ldquo;bigger impact&rdquo; actions. (So you&rsquo;re rewarded for remembering them and using them at the right time.)</li></ul><p>Hopefully this gives an idea of how I determine which tiles to hastily create and cut out for such prototypes. (I notice I usually don&rsquo;t talk about this and just say &ldquo;I made an educated guess as to what material I needed&rdquo;, which isn&rsquo;t really helpful.)</p><p>I started with a grid of 5x5 tiles, with the main diagonals faceup (the rest facedown), and the rules explained above.</p><p>Also, yes, this means I ended up with slightly more tiles than I needed in a single game. But I prefer that anyway, as it means even the base game has variety and slight uncertainty about what is or isn&rsquo;t included.</p><p>Finally, while I usually don&rsquo;t like text on tiles and would prefer to use icons, that just feels too hard for this game. I want the actions to be so simple that I can write those one-liners on the tiles, otherwise you need to <em>also remember</em> what exact action each icon stands for. (And including some expansions I want to add, the number of possible actions could be quite high.)</p><p>So, yeah, actions should be simple enough to write them out on the tiles. And the final tiles will be quite a bit <em>larger</em> than usual. (Which is also fine, because even with large tiles the number of pages to print would be at most 4 or 5. That&rsquo;s how small and simple this game would be.)</p><h3 id=playing-it>Playing it</h3><p>The biggest flaws usually jump out before even finishing that first game.</p><ul><li>Too many actions => It&rsquo;s overwhelming and doesn&rsquo;t actually help, as sometimes you just want to flip a tile facedown without taking an action anyway.<ul><li><strong>Solution?</strong> It&rsquo;s fine if more tiles have only 1 action or even 0 actions.</li></ul></li><li>Bigger point differences => it feels a bit &ldquo;meh&rdquo; to put a lot of effort into scoring a 4 instead of a 3. Especially if bad luck or guessing gives you a -6 right away next turn.<ul><li><strong>Solution?</strong> Add like 66% positive numbers, 33% negative. Also make the numbers larger, ranging until 9.</li><li>This is a general lesson I keep relearning :p Make sure most of your game goes in a positive direction, otherwise you have no momentum and the average benefit of playing a turn is &mldr; 0.</li></ul></li><li>Gathering information (about what tiles are where) is too slow => a skull action like &ldquo;flip one tile without taking its action&rdquo; is just too little. Also, it clearly gives away your intentions and gives others an advantage.<ul><li><strong>Solution?</strong> Add more information actions, which are also more powerful. Instead of &ldquo;flip 1 tile (without action)&rdquo; do something like &ldquo;flip all adjacent tiles (without action)&rdquo;. This makes more happen per turn, both allowing more strategy and obscuring your intentions better.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Also, the game also works with a smaller grid of 4x4, which might be nice for first-time players or kids. But it&rsquo;s a bit too limited for a more serious game.</p><p>I also realized it might be nice to have an action for a tile which triggers <strong>when scored</strong> (or &ldquo;when inside your score pile&rdquo;). This would be a star icon or something. I will keep a limit of <em>two actions</em> per tile, though. Adding 3 actions on any tile would be completely overwhelming.</p><p>The biggest issue is when the game <strong>ends</strong>.</p><ul><li>You can only score using those &ldquo;score actions&rdquo;</li><li>Which means the (base) game becomes pointless once all those actions are gone.</li><li>But &mldr; how do you know? Half the tiles are facedown!</li></ul><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>This is less of an issue with an expansion I envisioned, where you can also score by creating 3-in-a-row of matching tiles. But I really want to keep that out of the base game, to keep it simple.</p></aside><p>Ending when the deck runs out is too volatile. Maybe all the score tiles arrived really late, ending the game just before it really gets interesting.</p><p>Saying &ldquo;once there is consensus that all score tiles are gone, stop&rdquo; is reaaaally vague.</p><p>No, I felt that the actual solution would be to think the other way. Provide a second way, that is always possible, to clear the field. So the game simply ends once the entire field is gone.</p><p>This rule ended up being:</p><blockquote><p>Any time an entire row or column is <em>faceup</em>, remove it from the board (and refill with tiles from the deck, if possible).</p></blockquote><p>Playtesting showed that this isn&rsquo;t something that happens very easily &mldr; until the board is small during the end game. Which is what we want.</p><h2 id=creating-the-final-material>Creating the final material</h2><h3 id=theme--graphics>Theme & Graphics</h3><p>When I wrote down the initial idea, I somehow added the theme of &ldquo;fruit&rdquo;. With the game being called &ldquo;Captain Flip&rdquo;, and my stupid instinct to make <em>every</em> game about food, I decided this wasn&rsquo;t a great idea.</p><p>Instead, we needed something sea-related. I researched <em>sea cryptids</em> (like mythological sea monsters), thinking it&rsquo;d be a great theme if I could get drawings of them that were more simple and cute.</p><p>However &mldr;</p><ul><li>I didn&rsquo;t find enough that I&rsquo;d consider recognizable to most people. (To anyone else, many of those monsters would just look like &mldr; mostly identical monsters.)</li><li>All of them being monsters, there was no reason or rhyme behind some being loads of <em>negative points</em> and the others being <em>positive points</em>.</li></ul><p>So without really thinking about it, I shifted to simply &ldquo;sea creatures&rdquo;. I can create 10 recognizable ones. There are some that people will deem harmless, and others that are scary. It all just makes a lot more intuitive sense.</p><p>I still very much wanted this to be a kids/family game, though, so I &mldr;</p><ul><li>Let image AI generate these animals, but adding modifiers to make them cute and colorful.</li><li>Did the same for the few icons in this game.</li><li>Manually drew the colors and patterns around the tiles. (So I can make them as bold, consistent and recognizable as possible.)</li></ul><p>The end result is something like this. (As usual, this is an image of the process, starting with a barebones tiles and trying to find a better one.)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=captain_flip_tile_sketches.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Ugh, I always start with adding a border around my boxes for clarity, and it NEVER looks good." title="Ugh, I always start with adding a border around my boxes for clarity, and it NEVER looks good." width=1170 height=466></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Ugh, I always start with adding a border around my boxes for clarity, and it NEVER looks good.</span></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=fonts>Fonts</h3><p>Sometimes, searching fonts can take hours. Sometimes, it can take a minute.</p><p>This time I was lucky to be in the second category. I knew I wanted a <em>condensed</em> font for the body, so the action text(s) wouldn&rsquo;t take as much space on the tile. As usual, I also require my body font to have <em>italic</em> and <strong>bold</strong> styles. This narrowed the selection down so much that I could easily pick from the few remaining options.</p><p>For the header, I searched on keywords like &ldquo;flip&rdquo;, &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;, &ldquo;double&rdquo;, &ldquo;sea&rdquo;, etcetera. Eventually, searching &ldquo;double font&rdquo; led me to discover a whole new category of fonts: those where each letter displays itself <em>twice</em>. They are doubled.</p><p>Firstly, this is interesting and new to me. Secondly, this quickly led me to a font that illustrates the game (by each letter being two times itself) but also has a few letter shapes that resemble sea objects (like the &ldquo;t&rdquo; being an anchor).</p><p>The fonts paired well together&mdash;we&rsquo;re done. (You can already see them in the image above.)</p><h3 id=generation>Generation</h3><p>Initially, I just randomly assigned actions. It&rsquo;s always good to start with the simplest (most &ldquo;naive&rdquo;) approach, because sometimes that just works and you&rsquo;re done. This time, it didn&rsquo;t.</p><ul><li>We need tighter control over how many tiles have 0, 1, or 2 actions.</li><li>We want to ensure each action appears at least X times. (Completely random draw might, however unlikely, cause some important actions to just &mldr; not appear at all.)</li></ul><p>As usual, the solution is simply to write the generation code in two steps.</p><ul><li>First we create a list of all the actions. This list starts empty, then we add each action its <em>minimum</em> number of times, and then we fill the remaining space with random draws.</li><li><em>Then</em> we assign actions to tiles by randomly drawing from that list we pregenerated.</li></ul><p>What else do we need to generate for each tile? The <em>type</em> and <em>color</em>. Those are two different things.</p><ul><li>The <em>type</em> is the type of fish (e.g. jellyfish) and how much points its worth (always the same). This also uses a pregenerated list, in which types with values closer to 0 appear more.</li><li>The <em>color</em> is the color/pattern around the edge. This is only used in the main expansion where you can match-three based on color. This is simply <em>distributed fairly</em>: we divide the number of tiles by the number of colors, round up, then create a list where each color appears that number of times. Drawing from that list, all colors should appear equally often in the entire set.</li></ul><p>The colors are simply chosen from a list of &ldquo;most contrasting colors&rdquo;. I saved several such lists some time ago, and using a random one for each project has made life so much easier. I can be certain the colors are easily distinguishable and readable by anyone, just by reading the first X colors I need from such a list. The downside, of course, is that all colors are the same across projects. But does it really matter if each game of mine has a slightly different shade of red?</p><h3 id=the-final-material>The final material</h3><p>It took me about half a day to prepare the data/generators, create all the graphics, and write the drawing code. The next day, I fixed any issues and polished it to get the final generated material.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=captain_flip_final_material_1.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The 2-action tiles of the final material." title="The 2-action tiles of the final material." width=718 height=835></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>The 2-action tiles of the final material.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=captain_flip_final_material_2.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The 1-action and 0-action tiles of the final material." title="The 1-action and 0-action tiles of the final material." width=717 height=845></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>The 1-action and 0-action tiles of the final material.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>I think it looks quite colorful and suitable for children too, without being too busy or complicated. Which is especially good because it&rsquo;s a memory game. I like it.</p><p>The percentages of 2-action, 1-action and 0-action tiles are just guesses right now. But after making this many games, such educated guesses are usually already in the right ballpark.</p><p>I guess what I like the most is that the full game is only 4 pages to print and cut. That includes the expansions and lots of variety/replayability. Some of my recent games have forgotten the requirement to keep material minimalist, and I felt that in the hours spent preparing and/or cutting prototypes :p</p><h2 id=playtest>Playtest</h2><p>@TODO: Write playtest notes, then write conclusion</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/i-bid-you-not/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-7" style=--rotation:0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/easter-eggventures/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-8" style=--rotation:1.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
