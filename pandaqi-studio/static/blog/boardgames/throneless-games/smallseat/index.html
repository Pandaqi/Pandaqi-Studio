The imagery I generated was beautiful, but very fantastical and a bit more &mldr; grown-up. For example, one of the games has a few emblems for different factions that are seriously scary (fictional) monsters.</p><p>Additionally, these games started as &ldquo;games you could play while standing up&rdquo; &mldr; but none of them really fit that description anymore. It&rsquo;s still preferred to have some sort of table for the Discard pile and the Vote pile.</p><p>As such, I started experimenting.</p><ul><li>Could I generate more &ldquo;cute&rdquo; and &ldquo;kidfriendly&rdquo; emblems?</li><li>Could I rewrite the rules to <em>actually</em> allow the game to be easily played without table or chairs?</li><li>And in the process, try some other rules that might lead to a game that&rsquo;s even faster/simpler to play and setup?</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s how this version was born.</p><h2 id=creating-the-imagery>Creating the imagery</h2><p>This was a rather simple matter. (One of the reasons I actually got this idea and decided to go through with it.)</p><p>Through the previous games, I&rsquo;d already finetuned the visual style and workflow for these games. I had a list of exact prompts I could feed the generative AI to get images &ldquo;in the ballpark&rdquo; of what I needed. (Most of them still required tinkering or extra manual drawing afterwards. But out of 20 generated images, I&rsquo;d usually find one or two that had done 95% of my job.)</p><p>This meant I learned two ways to make the images much more cute and cartoony.</p><ul><li>Literally add the word <code>cute</code></li><li>Ask for huge eyes and bright colors</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s it. The combination of cute, bright and big eyes is a very common descriptor for kidfriendly cartoony drawings (at least in the dataset on which the AI trained).</p><p>I created a list of &ldquo;common animals&rdquo; that looked cute (in general). This meant I had to change some animals from the other versions. For example, Queenseat had a <em>rabbit</em> as the White animal at first. But a rabbit was an obvious choice for <em>this</em> game, so I had to swap that for a white Owl.</p><p>Once I had the list, I generated the icons with AI and did manual painting where needed.</p><h2 id=changing-the-rules>Changing the rules</h2><p>The biggest changes would be in two areas.</p><ul><li>Setup</li><li>Somehow make the Discard and Vote pile &mldr; disappear!</li></ul><p>The setup of Kingseat is the most involved part of the rules.</p><ul><li>You need to do some math to get the right number of cards (and Princes) in your deck</li><li>You need to designate the Kingseat</li><li>You need to designate people in charge of the Discard and Vote piles</li><li>Players trade cards with their left and right neighbors</li><li>And then they pick their secret Loyalty</li></ul><p>I wanted to shorten this. Hence, my goal for this game was &mldr;</p><ul><li>To allow throwing anything in the deck and it should work</li><li>To remove separate piles (which would need a table)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t do any <em>trading</em> and don&rsquo;t pick your Loyalty during setup.</li></ul><h3 id=no-piles>No piles</h3><p>The solution? A <strong>player</strong> would represent (and hold) the piles. (I call this the <strong>Teller</strong>.)</p><ul><li>One player starts without cards</li><li>The winning votes from a round, go into <em>their hand</em> (facing them)</li><li>The discarded cards also go into their hand, but facing <em>outward</em> (towards the other players)</li></ul><p>I thought it was a beautiful solution. It means one player automatically tracks these two separate piles. This player can just <em>play the game</em> together with the others, but with the interesting wrinkle that their cards are decided by what everyone else plays.</p><h3 id=dont-pick-loyalty-at-the-start>Don&rsquo;t pick Loyalty at the start</h3><p>The solution? You stop playing once you have <strong>1 card left</strong>. That final card <em>is your secret Loyalty</em>.</p><p>Another solution I thought was elegant. It also removes the reason for the 5-step setup of Kingseat.</p><p>In Kingseat, you pick your Loyalty at the start, before playing the game. This means you need <em>some</em> information about the other players and <em>some</em> way to design your starting hand, otherwise you have nothing to go on. That&rsquo;s why I added the trading of cards and such.</p><p>But if your Loyalty is simply your final card, you can switch strategies during the game. As more information becomes available&mdash;while playing&mdash;you can decide to leave another card for last.</p><p>The only exception is that special player holding the piles (the Teller). Their hand will only <em>grow</em> during the game. As such, they must publicly announce their Loyalty at the start.</p><p>These two simple &ldquo;wrinkles&rdquo; to the rules seem very interesting to me. I need to <em>test</em> them, however, to see if they are any good.</p><h3 id=easy-deck>Easy deck</h3><p>This problem mostly solved itself by solving the others!</p><p>You can create any deck you want. Any leftover cards simply go into the hand of the Teller from the start.</p><p>By adding more cards or animals, you create a longer and more complicated game. The choice is still yours&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a very easy choice now.</p><p>In fact, I lean towards adding fewer cards per animal, or designing animals with a different number of cards in total. So that I can always say: &ldquo;just add <em>all</em> cards for this animal, and it will be balanced&rdquo;</p><aside class="example masked-link-block"><span class=label>Example ||</span><p>Let&rsquo;s say you have an animal that counts for <strong>two</strong> votes. Both during the game, and when counting at the end. That&rsquo;s <strong>very powerful</strong>. One way to balance that, would be to simply include fewer cards of that animal.</p></aside><h2 id=back-after-a-break>Back after a Break</h2><p>It&rsquo;s been roughly a year. I had planned to &ldquo;update&rdquo; the Throneless Games project and make the other games for the end of this year, and with the deadline approaching, I had to return.</p><p>I was initially hesitant to do so, I must admit. I left the project behind with the idea of &ldquo;could be great, but currently the ideas are just not there yet, and I see no solution&rdquo;. I had hoped to gain more inspiration or insight by leaving it for a year.</p><p>Fortunately, I was right.</p><p>My biggest issues were <em>Lack of information</em> and <em>Lack of control</em> (which leads into monotone or static gameplay). When I came back, I quickly saw some &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; ways to solve these, both at a core level (the Throneless Mechanic itself) and the more superficial level (the actions on specific Animal cards).</p><h3 id=how-do-we-get-more-information>How do we get more information?</h3><p>For example,</p><ul><li>Instead of an action always being good (&ldquo;you may see someone else&rsquo;s cards&rdquo;), have many of them require a small payment from you (&ldquo;reveal 1 card to see another player&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;). This not only makes it more interesting tactically, but doubles the amount of information being passed around every round.</li><li>The Teller <em>always</em> plays their Vote first. (Everyone else votes simultaneously in secret.)<ul><li>We needed this rule anyway for when they used a public card, as everyone would know what they voted.</li><li>Making it &ldquo;always&rdquo; simplifies the rule and gives players a least 1 known card going into a round.</li></ul></li><li>Similarly, we add actions or rules that <em>limit</em> what you can play in a round.<ul><li>For example, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not allowed to vote the animal the Teller shows the most&rdquo;.</li></ul></li><li>We change something at the core: <strong>when you swap places, also swap 1 card</strong></li></ul><p>Because this game has no &ldquo;Dark Cards&rdquo; and all cards (of one Animal) share the same action, the first bullet point was needed anyway. Without it, actions were all unbalanced and there was no counterweight. Having this &ldquo;pay a little->get a big reward&rdquo; system solved that.</p><p>Similarly, after making so many games, I&rsquo;ve learned a simple truth:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>Trading / Swapping</em> cards is always stronger than <em>looking at</em> cards.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>When you&rsquo;re allowed to <em>look</em> at another player&rsquo;s cards, you have to <em>remember</em>. Even people with a great memory will struggle to remember 10+ cards spread across player&rsquo;s hands. If what you see is of no interest to you, this action now feels <em>wasted</em>.</p><p>When you swap/trade cards instead, you don&rsquo;t have to remember. That new card is literally in your hand; you can see it at all times! And this action actually <em>changed</em> the state for two players, which always makes it feel impactful.</p><p>In the end, I added three of these ideas into the game. The one about &ldquo;limiting&rdquo; which cards you may play felt like one rule too many for this simplest version.</p><h3 id=how-do-we-get-more-control>How do we get more control?</h3><p>This was partially solved by the previous changes.</p><ul><li>Because the Teller votes first, you know 1 Vote already, so you can play around that to make your desired Animal win more easily.</li><li>Because you swap cards, you can give away &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cards <em>or</em> plant them at another player who must vote them at some point.</li><li>Because actions are slightly more involved, you still have a choice or control after deciding to execute it.</li></ul><p>Still, I wanted to give the player in the Smallseat just a little more power. That position is special so it should <em>be</em> special.</p><p>For this simplest version, I picked one small twist.</p><blockquote><p>The Boss ( = person in Smallseat) decides if the round happens CLOCKWISE or COUNTER CLOCKWISE.</p></blockquote><p>I need to explain the direction (clockwise, normally) anyway. So changing that sentence into one presenting a choice doesn&rsquo;t complicate the rules.</p><p>It <em>does</em> give the Boss more power and control, while making the game far more varied.</p><h3 id=picking-the-actions>Picking the actions</h3><p>With this new knowledge, I picked simple actions for all animals. Things I hadn&rsquo;t before in Kingseat, things that had this &ldquo;pay->reward&rdquo; structure to give more info/control.</p><p>From my original ideas (left behind a year ago), I had to discard most actions. They were too powerful or chaotic, such as</p><ul><li>&ldquo;The Teller flips all their cards (public &lt;> secret)&rdquo; => Woah, Tiamo, this literally means a single action can undo ALL votes and switch them for random different ones. Not fun.</li><li>&ldquo;If CONDITION is met, you end the game instantly.&rdquo; => Conditional actions are too complicated, especially when they&rsquo;re such an exception. And it&rsquo;s near impossible to find a condition/rule that does NOT allow ending the game in the first few rounds, which obviously means you haven&rsquo;t actually played the game.</li></ul><p>Coming back to the game and reading my old notes, I also instantly had a few other ideas. Back then, I was probably afraid to touch the core mechanic. Now I know better: each Throneless Game was actually <em>far too similar</em> to one another, and I had to purposely make them <em>more different</em> at their core.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>I&rsquo;ve learned this from making a lot of other projects containing multiple games. It&rsquo;s not interesting or useful to create a second game if it only changes the look and a few minor rules/actions from the first one. Instead, I brainstormed all possible variations on my core idea, and made each &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; actually a unique game that went into an entirely different direction.</p><p>It&rsquo;s why I also stopped calling them &ldquo;spin-offs&rdquo; long ago, as now each game within a project is decidedly different and creates a different experience.</p></aside><p>As such, those other ideas do NOT appear in Smallseat, but in <em>one</em> of the other games. To really make those <em>unique</em> and worthy of playing (and developing, actually).</p><h2 id=the-final-cards>The final cards</h2><p>Below is a quick screenshot of the final PDF (at this moment in time).</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=smallseat_final_cards.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="I tried to get three different factions into frame, to give a varied overview of the cards." title="I tried to get three different factions into frame, to give a varied overview of the cards." width=738 height=797></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>I tried to get three different factions into frame, to give a varied overview of the cards.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>I settled on 9 cards per type, down from the original 12.</p><p>The original games had the confusing recommendation to include &ldquo;one fewer Animal than the number of players&rdquo;, and then deal out &ldquo;8 cards per player&rdquo;&mdash;which meant you also had quite some cards left over. Another one of those weird wrinkles that seems needlessly complicated now, looking back on it.</p><p>Now it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;include 1 animal per player; deal until empty (which means 9 cards per player)&rdquo;.</p><p>Also, better fonts and sizing + text formatting (the important part of actions is <strong>bold</strong>) does a <em>lot</em> of work making it look better and more professional.</p><h2 id=playtesting--polishing>Playtesting & Polishing</h2><p>@TODO</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/throneless-games/kingseat/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-7" style=--rotation:-1deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/throneless-games/queenseat/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-5" style=--rotation:0deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
