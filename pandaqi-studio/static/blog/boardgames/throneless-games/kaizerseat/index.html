It&rsquo;s the final (and most &ldquo;complex&rdquo;) entry in the <a href=https://pandaqi.com/throneless-games/>Throneless Games</a> collection.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve read any of the other devlogs (for the other games), you already know the core mechanic and general approach for this game. You also know that I made the first game (Kingseat) a while ago, then came back with new skills and insights a year later, to massively improve the quality of the whole project.</p><p>Fortunately, back then I had already sketched the rules and twists for each version, which meant I had already written 50% of the devlog for Smallseat and Queenseat.</p><p>But this game? It was wide open and I hadn&rsquo;t started a devlog yet. So, as you read this, remember it was written mostly after the fact.</p><h1 id=what-are-throneless-games>What are Throneless Games?</h1><p>They are games using my &ldquo;Throneless Mechanic&rdquo; at their core.</p><ul><li>Each round, you <strong>simultaneously vote</strong> for a Seeker. (Or Prince/Princess/Animal in the other games.)</li><li>The Seeker with the <strong>most votes</strong> wins the round.</li><li>(If <strong>tied</strong>, direction comes into play. The one closest to the Kaizerseat, in clockwise direction, wins.)</li></ul><p>The winning votes are scored (or handled in some favorable way).</p><p>All losing votes now make a decision.</p><ul><li>Either execute the action on your card,</li><li>Or swap places with someone else.</li></ul><p>Why did I believe this mechanic could sustain multiple games? Why did I like this so much back then?</p><ul><li>Simultaneous turns are always good. (Faster gameplay, everyone always stays engaged, etcetera.)</li><li>They are simple.</li><li>The games can be played without table/chairs.</li><li>And swapping places strategically (as a core element of the game) is fresh and unique.</li></ul><p>When trying to turn this into balanced games, though, I learned a lot about game development (again). Because as it&rsquo;s written, the idea isn&rsquo;t great yet.</p><p>For example, swapping places only matters because you&rsquo;ll be closer to Kaizerseat <em>in case of a tie</em>. In practice, this meant the final player always swapped and always for the same reasons. Sometimes it worked out great, other times it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not great, is it?</p><p>As such, I invented many small tweaks to the core rules to <em>actually</em> make your actions matter and to <em>actually</em> allow strategy and long-term plans. Each Throneless Game has a different set of tweaks, giving the simplest ones to the simplest games &mldr; and the hardest ones to this game!</p><h2 id=what-should-kaizerseat-be>What should Kaizerseat be?</h2><p>The following ideas were <em>all</em> part of the earlier games, until I pushed them back to only appear in this &ldquo;most complicated&rdquo; variant.</p><ul><li><strong>Thronecard</strong>: each game/round, draw a random card from this deck, which adds a permanent twist to the rules. (This card also neatly indicates where the Kaizerseat is at all times.)<ul><li>These were originally meant to be <em>for the whole game</em>. Draw once at the start from a tiny deck of options, apply for the whole game.</li><li>Then I realized it was more interesting to have one deck <em>for the game</em> (&ldquo;Thronecards&rdquo;) and one <em>per round</em> (&ldquo;Seatcards&rdquo;).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Direction Switching</strong>: in the other games, direction for checking ties/actions is always clockwise. In this game, this can be modified to counter-clockwise. Which is a simple rule, but in practice makes the game much more volatile of course.</li><li><strong>Different Types of Actions</strong>: in the other games, all actions have the same &ldquo;type&rdquo;. That is, they trigger when executed. But there are obviously other types of actions that were interesting, such as &ldquo;when scored&rdquo;.<ul><li>This was a clear lesson from playtesting Kingseat. In the first version, I had given about 30% of actions a different &ldquo;type&rdquo; or a different &ldquo;condition&rdquo; that decided when they triggered.</li><li>Well this confused the hell out of everyone. Especially because these conditions were <em>written within the action</em>, making them longer paragraphs, and making the distinction unclear unless you read the card carefully.</li><li>When moved to Kaizerseat, I knew I had to add clear icons/text to immediately indicate the <em>type</em> of action on a card.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The most complicated actions:</strong> similarly, I invented many actions that sounded cool &mldr; but needed too many words to explain, or required some number-crunching. All of these were moved to Kaizerseat, to use the absolute simplest ideas for earlier games.</li></ul><p>And so, by the time the other versions were done, Kaizerseat was basically also done by default ;) Many earlier ideas were simply integrated here.</p><h2 id=inventing-actions>Inventing Actions</h2><p>The biggest missing piece was the long list of <em>actions</em> per Seeker.</p><p>The simplest game has only 1 action per Seeker: all their cards are simply identical. The next game has 1 unique &ldquo;Dark action&rdquo; that&rsquo;s far more powerful but, as stated, only appears on a single card.</p><p>And so the sequence logically continues until Kaizerseat had <strong>one regular action</strong> and <strong>3 Dark actions</strong>.</p><p>I feared this would be too many, but when I actually sat down to invent them all, I had so many ideas that 3 unique actions per type was perfect.</p><p>This process also increased the list of different <strong>action types</strong>:</p><ul><li>When handled = the usual way. Triggers when you execute the card instead of swapping places.</li><li>When revealed = when played, before checking who won the vote.</li><li>When won = triggers if this card was the winning Seeker.</li><li>When Tell = this action is true when checking who won at the end of the game (by counting the cards in the Tell).</li><li>When hired = these cards are placed permanently before you, giving you an extra power or curse.<ul><li>These are so powerful through their permanence, though, that they only appear on unique Dark cards.</li></ul></li></ul><p>At first, nothing seemed wrong. When designing the specific actions, though, an unintuitive clash of ideas became apparent.</p><ul><li>Some cards only trigger by choice (such as &ldquo;when handled&rdquo; or &ldquo;when hired&rdquo;)</li><li>While others trigger automatically</li></ul><p>This is messy to explain and execute for players. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world, of course, but I really want to simplify games at all times.</p><p>Similarly, because this game constantly changes&mdash;different Thronecard, different Seatcard, etcetera&mdash;I had no consistent method to make swapping places very useful. It felt as if it was the &ldquo;worst choice&rdquo; at almost all times.</p><p>Then I noticed I could invent many interesting actions &mldr; which were <em>bad for you</em>. Those are meaningless, of course, if you can always <em>choose not to trigger it</em>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how I made the final rule choice that made Kaizerseat what it is.</p><blockquote><p>You always execute the action on your card. Only if this does nothing (right now), do you swap places.</p></blockquote><p>This simple rule unifies how you deal with all actions. It also means you&rsquo;re not just &ldquo;sitting around doing nothing&rdquo; when your action fails&mdash;in that case, you swap. (For example, some actions are conditional: &ldquo;If the Leader won this round, then &mldr;&rdquo;)</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>Yes, by now the decision had been made to NOT make this game playable without a table. It&rsquo;s just impractical and not what players would want out of a longer game.</p></aside><h2 id=something-i-shouldve-realized-long-ago>Something I should&rsquo;ve realized long ago</h2><p>So, the game still includes swapping places. You can use that to become Leader and break ties favorably, but that&rsquo;s not enough.</p><p>Only now I realized the obvious solution, which I retroactively applied to the other games where possible.</p><p>Many actions say something like &ldquo;All players must reveal 1 card to you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Steal a card from 1 player&rdquo;.</p><p>This makes positioning irrelevant. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where <em>you</em> or <em>your target</em> sits!</p><p>But we can change that to something that <em>does</em> rely on position and instantly make swapping a very useful action.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Both your neighbors reveal 1 card to you.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Steal 1 card from the Leader.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;End the round immediately.&rdquo; ( = All players after you, most likely your neighbors, get no more turns.)</li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t know how I didn&rsquo;t see it when I made Kingseat. It&rsquo;s such an obvious change that improves the entire core mechanic with a snap of the fingers.</p><p>You know Patrick has a lot of Green Votes? And you want one? First <em>swap</em> until they become your neighbor, then you can steal the card.</p><p>You have a Dark card that targets the Leader? And you think Anne is ahead and want to stop her? Wait until she becomes the leader and <em>then</em> try to play that card.</p><p>More and more, I&rsquo;m learning how <em>constricting</em> choice is actually often very, very good for games. (For example: Instead of allowing you to pick <em>any</em> player, only pick neighbors.)</p><h2 id=creating-the-cards>Creating the cards</h2><p>I already had the shared code for generating + drawing the cards (used in all other games, with only minor tweaks in configuration).</p><p>This time, however, we needed something extra.</p><ul><li>That clear indicator on cards about <em>action type</em>.</li><li>Unique designs for the Thronecard and Seatcard (which only need to draw some legible text on top of that).</li></ul><p>Generating these cards is easy. I just loop through all the ideas I placed in a list, and put them in a <code>Card</code> object, just like all the other cards.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>This is probably one of the reasons I gravitate towards making games as &ldquo;projects&rdquo; with shared mechanics. It allows me to make unique, playable, great games &mldr; without having to redo everything from scratch every time. Like, picking GOOD FONTS for a new game can be hours of research on its own.</p></aside><p>Drawing, of course, required some sketching and trial-and-error. You want things to be clear, but also to not step on each other&rsquo;s toes or obscure other elements. You want to be consistent in how it looks, but not TOO consistent, because then there&rsquo;s no clear hierarchy and players can&rsquo;t discern different elements of a card.</p><p>I guess I&rsquo;m just describing the general skill of design now, so let&rsquo;s look at some images. Notice the part at the bottom that shows the action <em>type</em> (text + icons around it).</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=kaizerseat_final_cards.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="This is the &ldquo;small&rdquo; size, so I could get a few more cards in the image.

And it draws much faster during debugging.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>And these are the Thronecards / Seatcards. I&rsquo;m still playing with font size, text alignment, and spacing / how to write these actions. Some of them can get quite long and not as easy to read if it&rsquo;s just one block of text. But the general idea is there.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=kaizerseat_final_cards_thronecards.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="This is the &ldquo;large&rdquo; size, 9 cards per standard A4 page." title="This is the &ldquo;large&rdquo; size, 9 cards per standard A4 page." width=741 height=718></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>This is the &ldquo;large&rdquo; size, 9 cards per standard A4 page.</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>With that, the entire game was done.</p><h2 id=playtesting--polishing>Playtesting & Polishing</h2><p>@TODO</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/throneless-games/queenseat/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-8" style=--rotation:2deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><span class=nav-disabled>No next page :(</span></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
