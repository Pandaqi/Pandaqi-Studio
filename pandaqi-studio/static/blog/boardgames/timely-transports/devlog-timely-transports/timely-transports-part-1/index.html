<strong>hybrid</strong> board and computer game!</p><p>(I don&rsquo;t have a strong name for this type of game yet. A <em>comboard
game</em>? A <em>&ldquo;smart game&rdquo;?</em>)</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=timely-transports-1.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="How the hybrid idea works (taken from rulebook)" title="How the hybrid idea works (taken from rulebook)" width=1366 height=1575></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>How the hybrid idea works (taken from rulebook)</span></figcaption></figure>{.float-right}</p><p>The game itself is played on a physical board with physical pieces, but
all players must also have their <em>smartphone</em> on the table and use that
for many actions in the game. It took me a <em>long</em> time to figure out how
to make this work, and accessible, and as fun as possible (instead of
people just staring at their phones all the time).</p><p>So, in this devlog, let me explain the original idea, my steps in
pursuing it, and how it finally let to the first game of its type: <a href=https://pandaqi.com/timely-transports>Timely Transports</a></p><p>(I&rsquo;ll explain the game in detail later. All you need to know for now, to
understand the text below, is that it&rsquo;s a game about <em>transporting
goods</em> across a jungle. The game boards are randomly generated on the
website and you need to start a timer on your phone for each <em>movement</em>
of your vehicle(s).)</p><h2 id=where-did-the-idea-come-from>Where did the idea come from?</h2><p>Lately, I played a <em>lot</em> of &ldquo;<em>Magic Maze&rdquo;</em> games. In that game, the sand
timer is instrumental. When it runs out, you lose. During the game you
can &ldquo;reset&rdquo; it, but only four times, and you usually need all four of
those if you want to be successful.</p><p><figure class=inline-image><picture><img src=timely-transports-2.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Magic Maze (on Mars) in action" title="Magic Maze (on Mars) in action" width=1064 height=784></picture><figcaption class=side-note><span>Magic Maze (on Mars) in action</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>It reminded me of my love-hate relationship with sand timers. It is
<em>very easy</em> to miss it when they run out. They can get knocked over by
an enthusiastic player (certainly in a cooperative, all-around-the-table
game like Magic Maze). But they also automatically add a time limit and
a sense of urgency to any game, which is very useful.</p><p>So I thought: why aren&rsquo;t there any boardgames where all your actions are
timed? Where you need to place a sand timer for doing something, and you
must wait until it runs out to complete the action?</p><p>Turns out those games exist! I stumbled upon <em>Kitchen Rush</em> and <em>Medic
Rush</em>.</p><p>The first game is basically the analog version of <em>Overcooked</em> (in case
that game is familiar to you): you must gather ingredients, combine
them, cook them, and then deliver them to customers for points. All of
these actions work by placing a sand timer on the appropriate spot and
waiting until it has run out.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for these games to ship to my country, but when they
do, I&rsquo;ll surely try them out, because they seem to be amazing,
cooperative, family-friendly, accessible games.</p><p>Anyway, this got me thinking: <strong>instead of including twenty sand timers
in a game box &mldr; why don&rsquo;t we let the computer do this?</strong></p><p>Computers are amazing at timers! (And numbers in general.) Instead of
having loads of physical timers (with fixed lengths), I can just start a
timer <em>of any length</em> on my phone with the press of a button.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s where the original idea came from. I wanted to create a
regular board game, but with the addition of a computer/smartphone
component that gives me great new possibilities, such as easy and
precise timers.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I just learned about the game <em>Pendulum</em> that <em>Stonemaier
Games</em> is releasing. Seems like everyone is discovering the use of
timers in games these last few years :p</p><h2 id=do-we-really-need-a-smartphone>Do we really need a smartphone?</h2><p>In the rules of Magic Maze, it states that you should NOT use a timer on
your smartphone for the game, as the experience is noticeably different.</p><p>And I like the inclusion of that warning, because I agree with it.</p><p>If I made a game which required only a single timer, yes, I would just
include a physical sand timer. It&rsquo;s faster, easier to use and
understand, keeps you in the game.</p><p>So, for my <em>hybrid</em> idea, I needed a <em>very compelling reason</em> to include
smartphones. We&rsquo;re still in the <em>early idea</em> stage now, so if I couldn&rsquo;t
find a good reason, I would&rsquo;ve just thrown this idea into the bin and
worked on something else.</p><p>The first thing I did was list the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of this approach.</p><h2 id=advantages-of-using-a-digital-component>Advantages of using a digital component</h2><p>These were the main advantages I could find before and during
development.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Memory</strong>. A computer can store and display loads of values, so
players don&rsquo;t have to keep track of anything or calculate values in
their heads. Most noticeably, it can keep perfect track of
<strong>score</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic</strong>. Instead of having only a limited set of timers with a
fixed length, I can create as many timers as I want, with varying
lengths.</p><ul><li><p>In fact, instead of having only one stage (full -> empty), I
can chain stages. In this game (Timely Transports), when a timer
runs out it goes into a second stage: <em>overtime</em>. This gives you
10 seconds to either click off the timer or upgrade your
vehicle.</p></li><li><p>Of course, the possibilities go far beyond timers, but I want to
keep it simple for now.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Fast Setup</strong>. Most people always have their smartphone at hand.
With these games, you only need to take out your phone and visit a
website, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. (As opposed to board games, where
you&rsquo;d need to take things out of the box, arrange them, perhaps hand
out cards, etc.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Sound</strong>. Surprisingly, this only occurred to me halfway
development. <em>Phones can play sounds!</em> I can play a sound whenever
something interesting happens in the game, and I can provide a
general background track that suits the game and the theme.</p><ul><li>This is a far greater advantage than you might think: when
you&rsquo;re starting at the board trying to decide your strategy, the
sound of an alarm bell is sure to bring your attention back to a
new event on your phone.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Endless Possibilities</strong>. Seriously, I can display <em>anything</em> on a
phone, and even make it interactive or use the internet! This allows
countless innovative mechanics that have never been done before in
gaming, which is at least worth exploring.</p></li></ul><h2 id=an-aside-about-timers--psychology>An aside about Timers & Psychology</h2><p>An additional advantage to using <em>timers</em> specifically, is that the game
is guaranteed to be quick (and end after a short amount of time) and
simultaneous, without any dead moments.</p><p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned over years of game playing and
developing, it&rsquo;s that <em>quick and (near) simultaneous games</em> appeal much
more to people than any other game. What turns people off, usually, is
the &ldquo;waiting on your turn&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to risk spending the next 2
hours sitting at a table&rdquo;. Just a small nugget of wisdom.</p><p>(Additionally, if you have a general crowd instead of frequent gamers,
<em>cooperative</em> games are your best bet. Many people are like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
not a competitive person&rdquo; and only want to play those types of games.
And when they do, ironically, they become extremely enthusiastic and
competitive :p)</p><h2 id=disadvantages-of-using-a-digital-component>Disadvantages of using a digital component</h2><p>And these were the main disadvantages I could find before and during
development.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hard Requirements.</strong> It&rsquo;s highly unlikely, <em>but possible</em>, that
someone doesn&rsquo;t have their phone, or doesn&rsquo;t have internet, or my
website is temporarily down. This would render the game unplayable,
as the digital component is absolutely necessary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Too Many Screens.</strong> People are already sitting behind screens
enough these days. I don&rsquo;t want to make &ldquo;placing your phone on the
table when playing a game&rdquo; a normal behavior. I play board games
(instead of video games) most of the time, <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s not behind
a screen and <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s a live social interaction. I don&rsquo;t want
my games to have a bad influence on people&rsquo;s habits or expectations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Size Restrictions.</strong> Smartphone screens are quite tiny, simple as
that.</p><ul><li><p>When building the interface for Timely Transports, I had to
completely rethink my design (and rewrite the code) three times,
because the first three versions were just <em>too small</em>. It was
hard to see icons at a glance, and it was easy to click the
wrong thing.</p></li><li><p>So, lesson learned, I really cannot expect to have more than 5
or 6 elements on the screen. (Where an element can be an icon,
or a score counter, or an event popping up.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Loose Links.</strong> I cannot &ldquo;connect&rdquo; a smartphone with a piece of
paper ( = the game board). I also don&rsquo;t want to connect multiple
smartphones with each other, as that is hard to program and
maintain, and makes the setup considerably harder. So, I can only
design games where a <em>loose link</em> is enough to make them work.</p><ul><li><p>For Timely Transports, I eventually decided to give each game
board an <em>identical</em> number of cities (with identical names).
That way, phones would automatically shout city names <em>that
existed</em> on the board, regardless of the game board you printed
or your player count.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, most of the information is on the game board
itself. At first, I wanted the phones to determine which goods a
city wanted to have. (For example, it would say &ldquo;City X now
wants <strong>Fruit</strong> for <strong>3 points</strong>!&rdquo;) But &mldr; this allowed the
accidental possibility that, for example, <em>all cities</em> wanted
fruit, and they wanted nothing else. Which would make the game
boring or simply unplayable.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s it for part 1. In the next article, I&rsquo;ll discuss how I used these observations to work towards the first version of this game.</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><span class=nav-disabled>No previous page :(</span></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/devlog-timely-transports/timely-transports-part-2/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-6" style=--rotation:0.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
