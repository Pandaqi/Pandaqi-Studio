Great times are upon us! After working on this project for exactly one year, I have launched my online store. A large international store, selling everything I ever made and probably everything I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make, which obviously includes the many board games and video games I design.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: Version 4.0?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2026/pandaqi-games-version-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2026/pandaqi-games-version-4/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve written several articles about updating the Pandaqi website. They alternated between updating the &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; behind it all, and updating the &lt;em&gt;design/look&lt;/em&gt; of the website.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I Coded My Own Webshop</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2026/how-i-coded-my-own-webshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2026/how-i-coded-my-own-webshop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article explains the steps I took to build my own &amp;ldquo;custom&amp;rdquo; webshop. It took a lot of effort to figure out how to set it up, how to connect different systems to each other, how to prevent making a lot of silly (or even costly) mistakes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wrote about the entire process and hope others can learn from it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Big Fat Website Update of 2025</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/big-fat-website-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/big-fat-website-update/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a handful of large websites (my game studio, my author website, my portfolio, etcetera). For the most part, after creating many websites while I was still in high school/university, I knew what I was doing. Most of these websites were well-designed from the start, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Principle of Least Maintenance</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/principle-of-least-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/principle-of-least-maintenance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve followed this blog for some time, or have simply encountered a few of my update articles, you know that I lost of a lot of time &lt;em&gt;maintaining&lt;/em&gt; Pandaqi. Not adding new content. Not redesigning to make it look more flashy. Simply &lt;em&gt;maintaining&lt;/em&gt;: fixing old bugs, making things a little faster, moving old games to a better system I developed for the newer ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2025 Update II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/pandaqi-games-update-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/pandaqi-games-update-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article explains the second major update I implemented for my Pandaqi Games website. (I usually end up having multiple such articles per year, as I slowly fix bugs, make the website more user friendly, etcetera.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcement: (Dutch) Webshop Launched</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/announcement-dutch-webshop-launched/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/announcement-dutch-webshop-launched/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a quick &amp;ldquo;announcement&amp;rdquo; that I launched my own webshop. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it short, as the online store contains &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; Dutch merchandise and isn&amp;rsquo;t very tightly related to &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt;. (Which is what this website and this blog is all about.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2025 Update I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/pandaqi-games-update-i/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2025/pandaqi-games-update-i/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article explains the first major update I implemented for my Pandaqi Games website.

I wrote it because it was interesting to realize and perhaps helps other creatives keep good habits and motivation. I also wrote it to have a nice devlog article to link to from the Throneless Games main page ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2024 Update IV</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update-iv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update-iv/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is my final update to the Pandaqi website and all its tools/systems/design for the year 2024. (At least, that&amp;rsquo;s the plan. I always end up finding more things I want to fix, but I&amp;rsquo;ll push those to my next big website update in 2025.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Dangers of Desynchronized</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/the-dangers-of-desynchronized/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/the-dangers-of-desynchronized/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I made a very simple party game called &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/slippery-slopes/"&gt;Slippery Slopes&lt;/a&gt;. I made it rather quickly in a single weekend, but it turned out okay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Return to Game Dev</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/my-return-to-game-dev/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/my-return-to-game-dev/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Once in a while I get an email from someone who enjoyed a game of mine. They usually don&amp;rsquo;t lead with that, no, they tell me about a bug, or ask a question, or offer &amp;ldquo;game services&amp;rdquo; I might want. But if I engage with them, then the truth is usually revealed after one or two emails: they discovered me one day, played a few of my multiplayer games with friends or their kids, had a great time, thus decided to email me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>No More Play Store</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/no-more-play-store/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/no-more-play-store/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick announcement that I will never be putting games on the Play Store / App Store again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Big Simplification Update (of 2024)</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/the-simplification-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/the-simplification-update/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I want to explain some pretty major changes I made to the Pandaqi website. What, why, how, and other questions containing the letter &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2024 Update III</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update-iii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article explains the reason behind another big update to my &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com"&gt;game studio website&lt;/a&gt;. One that is still in progress and probably will be for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2024 Update II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This update to the Pandaqi Games website is much smaller than usual, but still very important. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to write a short article about the problem, the changes and why I made them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Git and the Horror of Newlines</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/git-and-the-horror-of-newlines/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/git-and-the-horror-of-newlines/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I got the scare of my life. I had just pushed a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; update to the Pandaqi website, but when I checked it out &amp;hellip; almost all the images and fonts were broken. No, even worse, &lt;em&gt;corrupted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2024 Update</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-2024-update/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here we are again. Another big update to my &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com"&gt;game studio website&lt;/a&gt; that is almost entirely behind the scenes. This means all my work won&amp;rsquo;t be immediately visible to others, which is why I write articles like these to explain what I did (and feel good about being productive).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Journey to Becoming a Game Designer</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/my-journey-to-becoming-a-game-designer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/my-journey-to-becoming-a-game-designer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The original title for this article was &amp;ldquo;nobody becomes anything overnight&amp;rdquo;. While true, I was afraid this would set the wrong tone or give the wrong impression. Because this article merely showcases my journey to becoming a game designer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: Solving the Nightmare called Text</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-solving-the-nightmare-of-text/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/pandaqi-games-solving-the-nightmare-of-text/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com"&gt;game studio website&lt;/a&gt; has become so large and interactive these past few years that I basically have to do a big rewrite behind the scenes every few months now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why all my games were removed from the Play Store</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/why-my-games-were-removed-from-the-play-store/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 10:26:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2024/why-my-games-were-removed-from-the-play-store/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For many years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve had about 10 games on the Play Store. All those games were also released on desktop, but their primary target was usually mobile (free and supported by ads).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: The Big Typescript Update</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pandaqi-games-the-big-typescript-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pandaqi-games-the-big-typescript-update/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you thought we were done with huge updates to &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com"&gt;Pandaqi Games&lt;/a&gt; for this year&amp;mdash;as did I&amp;mdash;then you were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2023 Update (III)</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pandaqi-games-2023-update-iii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pandaqi-games-2023-update-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve published a few updates on this blog about the inner workings of &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com"&gt;Pandaqi Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I explained how the code was a HUGE mess (from almost 10 years of projects, going back to when I was a kid and had no clue what good programming was). I solved that by moving everything into simple libraries that were reused across the whole website.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pandaqi Games: 2023 Update (II)</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pandaqi-games-2023-update-ii/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pandaqi-games-2023-update-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I already &lt;a href="https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/pandaqi-games-2023-update"&gt;wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; about a huge update to Pandaqi games. Behind the scenes, lots of code was removed and improved, leading to the creation of a few &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; that handle everything for all pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PQ_DAW: A music editor for the web</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pq-daw/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/pq-daw/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;PQ_DAW ( = Pandaqi DAW) is a small, limited web implementation of a &amp;ldquo;Digital Audio Workstation&amp;rdquo;.

One that others might like as well: a library of &lt;strong&gt;word lists&lt;/strong&gt;. Use them for word games. Use them to quickly prototype new ideas or generate random words / concepts for inspiration. Use them for a spelling contest. Use them however you like!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bamboo Documentation</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/bamboo-docs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/2023/bamboo-docs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bamboo was made to introduce people to programming.
