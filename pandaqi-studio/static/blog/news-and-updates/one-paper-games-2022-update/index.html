I created a handful of them, experimenting with all sorts of fun ways to play games, and am very proud of the results.</p><p>There is one problem, though: it&rsquo;s quite impossible to <em>monetize</em> these games. They are literally free and can be played with one piece of paper.</p><p>So I had to stop development on these games to focus on projects that <em>could</em> actually make me money. Which is why the boardgames page hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a year.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the status now? What&rsquo;s the plan? Let me give you the update.</p><h2 id=quality-of-life>Quality of Life</h2><p>When I revisited the pages of my last OPGs, I immediately noticed some things that could be improved. The games still worked 100% and looked the same as how I left them. These are merely &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; improvements, but those always end up being more important than I predicted.</p><p>These were my issues:</p><ul><li>Most games summarize how it works <em>before</em> displaying the widget for generating a random board. That&rsquo;s a lot of text people need to scroll past. Let&rsquo;s switch it around (or allow <em>minimizing/hiding</em> this part)</li><li>Some games still had <em>too much text</em> on the main page. I&rsquo;ll try to shorten some of that.</li><li>My random game generators work on 99% of the devices, but not all. Some mobile phones do weird stuff, especially if their Wi-Fi connection is spotty. I&rsquo;ll add a comment telling people to (preferably) use a desktop pc.</li><li>Continuing on that issue, now the games are only playable if that generator is working flawlessly. It&rsquo;s not too hard for me to <em>pre-generate</em> some game boards and put them in the Google Drive (besides the PDF with the game rules). It would make it easier to play the game for some people.</li></ul><p>So I spent about a day fixing all of these issues and improving the pages.</p><p>Also, when I moved the whole old website to a completely new (and much better) system a year ago, some things were accidentally changed or broken in the process. I found some typos here and there, website layouts that weren&rsquo;t exactly like I wanted them to be, things like that.</p><p>None if this is a major issue. But when it comes to selling &ldquo;innovative boardgames on paper&rdquo; to people, you really need to pull out all the marketing stops :p</p><h2 id=the-future>The Future</h2><p>As mentioned, these games just cannot be monetized, and they are <em>hard</em> to make.</p><p>I still have many ideas for them, some even already 20%-30% developed. But I just don&rsquo;t see myself finishing completely new OPGs in the coming years. My focus needs to be elsewhere.</p><p>I <em>do</em> see two other options.</p><ul><li>I have some really small ideas that wouldn&rsquo;t take too long to develop. You might see those appear in the (near) future.</li><li>There are ideas that work as a boardgame, but also as a video game, or as a companion to a book. Those are still worthwhile to pursue.</li></ul><p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a bit sad to realize that you need <em>money</em> to survive, and that some passion projects are cool but don&rsquo;t make you that <em>money</em>. But at the same time, I&rsquo;m happy with what I was able to make, and the options I described above will still allow me to try new things and add new projects over time.</p><p>Hopefully one day, I have enough money to freely develop these kinds of projects :)</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/how-i-redesigned-my-game-studio-website/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-3" style=--rotation:-1.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/the-blog-has-been-redesigned/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-8" style=--rotation:-0.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
