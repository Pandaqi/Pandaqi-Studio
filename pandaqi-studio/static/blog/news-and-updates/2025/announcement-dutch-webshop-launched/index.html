<a href=# id=toc-toggle>Show</a></div></aside><aside id=table-of-contents class=masked-link-block><header><h2>Table of Contents</h2></header><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></aside><div><p>This article is a quick &ldquo;announcement&rdquo; that I launched my own webshop. I&rsquo;ll keep it short, as the online store contains <em>mostly</em> Dutch merchandise and isn&rsquo;t very tightly related to <em>games</em>. (Which is what this website and this blog is all about.)</p><p>You can <a href=https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl>visit the online store here</a>.</p><p>The official Dutch name means &ldquo;Tiamo sells his soul&rdquo;. Because that&rsquo;s what it feels like. If you&rsquo;ve followed me for a while, or seen any of my work, you know that I have absolutely no income, I give everything away for free, and I hate money and all systems attached to it. Obviously, this has the downside of being broke, which means I can&rsquo;t survive!</p><p>So &mldr; I considered all my options for years, and as much as I dislike it, starting my own webshop to actually <em>sell</em> my work was the best choice left to me. I have made tons of things, both digital goods and (what could be put on) physical goods. And I will hopefully keep making more of that. Actually providing a safe, reliable, streamlined place to SELL it (instead of giving it away for free wherever) was the most logical step towards getting an income.</p><p>Creating your own online store from scratch is, however, a huge task. Even my hyperactive and improvisational brain, which likes to just jump into things without planning ahead, took a step back and made something resembling a plan.</p><p>I realized I still had my oldest Dutch website. It used to be the home for my blog and writing work, until all of that moved to <a href=https://tiamopastoor.com>TiamoPastoor.com</a>. I&rsquo;d paid for hosting in advance, so it would still be in the air for some time before it was actually removed.</p><p>And I thought &mldr;</p><ul><li>Why not use that existing Dutch domain as a <strong>playground to learn about running an online store</strong> (using pre-existing ecommerce systems)?</li><li>And then, some time later, use the lessons learned to actually <strong>launch the actual webshop</strong> (which would be custom-built, from scratch, to suit my needs and products far better and be easier/cheaper to maintain)?</li></ul><p>And so I did.</p><p>I used WordPress + WooCommerce to rapidly get my first webshop up and running. The first few weeks, I learned <em>so much</em> by making mistake after mistake, overhauling the website (and its pricing, shipping, policy, etcetera) five times, until I got a handle on things. While doing so, I created lots of merchandise to actually test the system and sell.</p><p>I think some of that merchandise turned out good enough to actually be its own brand and stay around. (When I switch to my bigger, actual webshop, <em>those</em> products will be copied over.) Some of it were quick sketches/test ideas that were never supposed to be permanent. They&rsquo;ll be gone at some point, but for now they fill the webshop nicely <em>and</em> allow me to test a few more things.</p><p>In general, that Dutch webshop really is a &ldquo;small feasability test&rdquo;. I learn as much as I can from it. I create merchandise of aaaall different types, at many different platforms, trying different marketing/selling/design strategies.</p><p>If that seems viable, and I know how to move ahead, the webshop probably disappears and we switch to my actual webshop. The actual webshop <strong>will be about games (a lot of the time)</strong>. I have a few ideas for merchandise that hopefully interests gamers. Most of all, though, these will be <em>digital goods</em>. I&rsquo;ve already made <em>so many</em> board games (printable PDFs) and video games, and I&rsquo;ve been expanding into other game-related areas as well (such as educational activities or printable escape rooms) the past few months, and I plan to make such digital goods the majority of that future online store.</p><p>At least &mldr; that was the plan.</p><p>As I write this, <em>the thing</em> happened again. The thing that always happens to me. To any hyperactive person, or hypercreative person, my experience tells me.</p><p>When I go for something, I really go for it :p</p><p>As such, that Dutch webshop is actually quite clean, polished, and full already. I made tons of nice products. The interface is clear, it supports loads of useful things, it is now verified in all the right places, etcetera. It has quickly gone from a mock/test webshop to something that I actually want to keep running for a bit longer. By now, it would be a waste (of all previous time/effort/designs) to build this large and promising Dutch webshop only to suddenly remove it.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>It would also be annoying from a customer&rsquo;s perspective, of course, when all products in their cart&mdash;or the entire cart/website!&mdash;disappears overnight. At the very least, now I need an <em>exit strategy</em> for this fully functional online store &mldr;</p></aside><p>I write this announcement to let everyone know what I&rsquo;ve been up to, and to allow Dutch people to check out that store and maybe buy something nice.</p><p>I also write it to give an updated plan/timeline of the &ldquo;actual, international webshop&rdquo;. So you know what&rsquo;s coming, and you know what I&rsquo;ve been doing (and <em>will be doing</em>) when it comes to game-related work.</p><ul><li>The current target for the international webshop is &ldquo;Summer 2025&rdquo;. This is a very tight deadline. Some things are already set up really well (thanks to lessons learned from the Dutch webshop!), other things still need to be 100% figured out.</li><li>It will probably launch with a wide array of <em>digital goods</em> to purchase, which will partially consist of <em>previous work</em> I&rsquo;ve already done and partially consist of <em>new work</em>. (I am sorry, some things that were free before will be paid in the future. But I&rsquo;m limiting the impact of this as much as possible. It&rsquo;ll probably be &ldquo;base game free, buy the expansions/extras in my store&rdquo;.)</li><li>And it will launch with a smaller number of <em>physical goods</em>. Some merchandise will simply be transferred from my Dutch webshop (the ones that are <em>not</em> language-dependent), some merchandise will be new and use logos/designs/ideas from established work of mine.</li><li>It should support international customers. (All text written in simple and clear English, shipping and costs clearly handled for all zones, etcetera.)</li><li>Besides that, it will be the usual things you expect from me: a very fast, minimalist, streamlined experience that does what it needs to do and nothing else. No trickery. No sleezy sales tactics. No ads. A colorful design, a hint of fantasy and story and magic around the webshop, but otherwise just a storefront for <em>my best (purchaseable) work</em> and that&rsquo;s it.</li></ul><p>When it&rsquo;s done, several much longer articles will be published about the entire process. Similar to the devlogs or diaries I write for all projects anyway. Because, as stated, it has already been a MOUNTAIN of work and there has been so much to learn (and so many mistakes to make &mldr;)</p><p>For now, you can check out <a href=https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl>the existing (mostly Dutch) webshop</a> called &ldquo;Tiamo Sells His Soul&rdquo;. Because I don&rsquo;t want anyone, for even a second, to wrongly assume I <em>like</em> having to sell stuff or will ever care about money :p And also because it&rsquo;s simply true. An artist puts their heart and soul into their work, so commercializing pieces of it &mldr; is literally selling your soul.</p><p>As usual, I tried to make the best of it. The main &ldquo;brand&rdquo; of the webshop is one that playfully introduces a devil character that&rsquo;s saying naughty things, or merchandise related around selling your soul or buying superpowers from that devil in exchange for something. Yes, even <em>that</em> online store has a thematic presence running through it. Doing anything else just feels bland and like the webshop is a dime a dozen.</p><p>That was the announcement,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/2025/pandaqi-games-update-i/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-1" style=--rotation:-0.5deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/2025/pandaqi-games-update-ii/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-8" style=--rotation:-0.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
