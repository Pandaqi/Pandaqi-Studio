<a href=# id=toc-toggle>Show</a></div></aside><aside id=table-of-contents class=masked-link-block><header><h2>Table of Contents</h2></header><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></aside><div><p>It&rsquo;s finally here!</p><p>I have completed and uploaded my official page full of free boardgames: <strong><a href=https://pandaqi.com/boardgames>Print & Play Boardgames</a></strong></p><p>On this page, you&rsquo;ll find a selection of the best boardgames that I have created over the last few years.</p><p>They are &ldquo;Print and Play&rdquo;. This means you only need to print one (or several) pieces of paper and you can start playing. For free!</p><p>Currently, as I post this, there are six games on the website. Three &ldquo;One Paper Games&rdquo; (which are exactly what the name suggests) and three more traditional games. The traditional games were originally created in Dutch (because that&rsquo;s my native language), but I have since manually translated them to English completely.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a folder on my computer with a whopping 50+ game ideas, all of which I found promising enough to write down, so you can expect this page to keep growing :)</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at some frequently asked questions:</p><p><strong>How can these games be free?</strong> For two reasons: it&rsquo;s very hard to make money from them <em>and</em> I actually refuse to make money from them.</p><p>I do not come from a rich background. Buying a professional game, which is usually 20-40 euros, is a big deal. This price tag is one of the things that keeps people, especially families with children, from entering the gaming hobby. Thus, when I started creating my own games, I set out to make them as <em>cheap</em> and as <em>simple</em> as possible. That&rsquo;s why I invented the &ldquo;One Paper Games&rdquo;: you literally only need a single piece of paper. My other games usually require only several pieces of paper, and a few extra papers if you want to print the rules. I want my games to be enjoyable by everyone.</p><p>Additionally, if your game is, in the end, nothing more than a few pieces of paper - that&rsquo;s not very sellable, is it? Imagine yourself buying a nice box for 20 euros, only to find there are just 100 printed papers inside. I never saw any chance of monetizing these games, so I doubled down on being free and accessible. Even though, in my humble opinion, the quality on these games is only rising and rising.</p><p>(Also, as I will repeat below, I think boardgames aren&rsquo;t being innovative enough. Sure, there are some really nice games coming out each year, but in the end they all follow the same patterns and rulesets. I want to try completely new stuff, something that&rsquo;s unlike any other game you&rsquo;ve played, and if it works, I put it on the website! If it doesn&rsquo;t work, well, I&rsquo;ll probably write a frustrated blog post about that some time.)</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong> This is best explained on the page itself, but it&rsquo;s simple enough to repeat here.</p><ul><li>Click on a game to visit its official page</li><li>Each game has a big, colorful &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button near the top</li><li>Click it and you are taken to a Google Drive.</li><li>There are two locations: <strong>Files</strong> and <strong>Rules</strong>. They contain exactly what you expect: the digital files to print and a digital rulebook (PDF-format)</li></ul><p>Just print the game you want, read the rules, and start playing!</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the quality?</strong> I am an artist in the most general sense of the word. I write (a lot), I draw, I design all types of games (video game, boardgame, physical game), I maintain several custom-made websites, all that jazz. This means that I <em>should</em> know what I&rsquo;m doing. All skillsets needed for professional boardgame creation are familiar to me. However, I am still young and learning, and six games on this website (about twelve in total) obviously isn&rsquo;t an impressive career record.</p><p>In short: I think these games are of an above average quality, especially for free &ldquo;Print & Play&rdquo; games, and I intend to keep improving and learning. My end goal is to make each game look, feel and play as if you had bought a professional game.</p><p><strong>What types of games do you create?</strong> I love being innovative and experimental &mldr; but I also love being understood and able to play games with many people. I try to balance these things: create something that nobody has seen before, but also keep it simple and familiar. Each of my games has <em>some</em> mechanic or set of ideas that I have never seen before in my boardgaming life. But don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m some abstract, vague, experimental artist with very deep and filosophic games - I try to be experimental within reason :p</p><p>(For example, in one of my games players are not a color or a pawn, but they are a <em>side of the board</em>. My &ldquo;One Paper Games&rdquo; are completely based on a new idea: you play the game by drawing with a pen(cil) on a single sheet of paper.)</p><p><strong>Can I give criticism? Feedback? Help in any way?</strong> Of course! It&rsquo;s very much recommended even! I am just a single (game) developer. I have the luxury of a large family and friends who like gaming, which allow me to test the games quite well, but it&rsquo;s still only a small pool of people. I can easily make mistakes, miss errors, create games that do not consistently play well, etcetera. So, whatever your thoughts on a game, don&rsquo;t be afraid to let me know.</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><span class=nav-disabled>No previous page :(</span></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/2021/how-i-redesigned-my-game-studio-website/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-7" style=--rotation:-1.5deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
