(Check out the other articles, like <a href=../pandaqi-games-2023-update/>this one</a>)</p><p>While I did that, a question popped up in the back of my mind. It nagged and nagged until I gave in.</p><p>All my rulebooks (for board games) have been traditional. They are a separate PDF you can download and print. They were made with traditional editorial software. (First Adobe InDesign, then Affinity Publisher.)</p><p>At the same time, many of my games use the website for something. (I call them &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; games. Often this online component is optional, though.) I even add a small rules overview to the page! And sometimes an animated GIF!</p><p>So why am I still making these PDFs? Why do I create a rules explanation 3+ times? Why as a PDF to print &mldr; when people are already on my website?</p><p>It felt like an extra step. Yes, the PDF will always be a nice backup. (Especially for people who want the rules in print.) But maybe it&rsquo;s better to modernize my setup.</p><p>Maybe I should start supplying rules as a <strong>web page</strong>.</p><h2 id=whats-the-idea>What&rsquo;s the idea?</h2><p>Currently, this is the process.</p><ul><li>You visit a game of mine</li><li>It has a short introduction + decoration / visuals</li><li>It also has a big Download button.</li><li>Below that, it tries to explain the game and what you need to play. (Any interactive elements are also there.)</li><li>If this interests you, you click Download.</li><li>You find the Rules PDF</li><li>You read that</li><li>If you want to keep the rules with you while playing, you&rsquo;ll have to <em>print</em> that PDF</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s just too many steps. I want to simplify it to &mldr;</p><ul><li>You visit a game of mine</li><li>It has a short marketing blurb + decoration / visuals</li><li>If that interests you, click the link to view the rules immediately</li><li>This is just a separate webpage where you can immediately <em>interact</em> with the rules.</li></ul><p>These rules will be (more) readable on devices. You can keep the rules with you while trying my game for the first time (by simply placing your phone/tablet on the table). Website language is so powerful that I can create rules that look good with more ease.</p><p>And a few months ago I learned how to setup website to easily convert them to PDF later. So we can keep that option around as well!</p><p>Weighing the pros and cons, weighing the effort needed, I decided to take the leap. I was already sketching the rules for my next game. I simply stopped writing my ideas in Word, and started writing them as a web page.</p><h2 id=but-wait-i-am-stupid>But wait, I am stupid</h2><p>My first try at this idea was <em>meh</em>. By routine, I designed the webpage like I&rsquo;d design any of my older rulebooks. From start to finish, it was basically the same as the PDF. But it actually took <em>more</em> effort, because I also had to make the rules &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; (to different screen sizes).</p><p>For example, the rules were still laid out top to bottom. It was a <em>long</em> page, where a rulebook would&rsquo;ve broken it into digestible pages.</p><p>This was worse! Was it a bad idea? Am I stupid?</p><p>I researched some more. I went to bed. The next day I woke up with the answer.</p><p>If I was going to design rulebooks as websites, I should <em>take advantage</em> of the strengths of this medium. I should view them in an entirely different way.</p><h2 id=adding-interactivity-to-rulebooks>Adding interactivity to rulebooks</h2><p>What&rsquo;s the advantage of the web?</p><ul><li>Interactivity: you can click, find, scroll, etcetera</li><li>Generation: I can let the computer do the hard work. By providing some code, the computer can generate nice decorations or styling from that.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a user. Either a new player who wants to learn the game, or somebody who wants to reference the rules (for a reminder) while playing.</p><p>The first type will be overwhelmed by the full rules. They only need to know the basics. (Any expansions, exceptions, variants, are all irrelevant.)</p><p>The second type is searching for one specific thing. (Like: &ldquo;how many points do you get for doing X again?&rdquo;) They want clear headings or a <em>clickable</em> table of contents.</p><p>This gave me the following structure.</p><ul><li>A simple heading that states &ldquo;These are the rules for game X&rdquo;</li><li>A table of contents</li><li>Sections that can <em>fold</em> and <em>unfold</em>. And communicate if they are essential to view or not.</li></ul><p>I considered adding a search bar into that interface as well. But the built-in search of your browser is certainly faster, cleaner and familiar to most.</p><h2 id=other-elements>Other elements</h2><p>Besides this, most rules have some recurring elements. I decided to make one stylesheet (that every rule page automatically loads) for these.</p><ul><li>Numbered / decorated headings. (Most headings have some decoration around them. Makes it look more professional <em>and</em> clearly indicates where you are in the rules.)</li><li>References to other parts within the same rules. (Other sections, example images, etcetera.)</li><li>Showing text and image alongside each other. (On small screens, they&rsquo;ll just go below each other.)</li><li>Default <em>icons</em> or <em>markup</em> for sections that will be in every rulebook. (This will mostly help if you read multiple rulebooks by <em>me</em>. You&rsquo;ll immediately understand 80% of the rules by seeing that icon.)</li></ul><h2 id=stretch-goals>Stretch goals</h2><p>Of course, we can take interactivity even further. We can &mldr;</p><ul><li>Animate parts of the rulebook.</li><li>Add small &ldquo;applets&rdquo; to randomly generate an example or game situation for you.</li></ul><p>The first one will often be possible, but is hard to make. I would either need to animate a short video myself, or I&rsquo;d need to do some CSS/JavaScript magic to animate something procedurally. Either way, it takes a lot of time and effort, which I can&rsquo;t reasonable spend on free board games.</p><p>The second will often not be possible, but is rather easy to code. I can simply give a button or some inputs, and <em>show</em> players what would happen in that situation.</p><aside class="example masked-link-block"><span class=label>Example ||</span><p>Let&rsquo;s say I have a game where you throw dice. I can create a button &ldquo;Do a turn!&rdquo;, then write code to get a random dice roll and explain the consequences of that.</p></aside><h2 id=how-does-this-work-in-practice>How does this work in practice?</h2><p>I use the Hugo static website generator. (Highly recommend it, by the way.)</p><p>This means I can create a &ldquo;layout&rdquo; named <code>rules.html</code>, and it will automatically be used by all pages with a path that ends with <code>rules/_index.md</code></p><p>This layout loads some things by default</p><ul><li>The stylesheet for those common styling elements</li><li>The unique stylesheet for these particular rules</li><li>The script for &ldquo;Paged.js&rdquo; => the system I use for converting the page to a PDF</li><li>The script for my interactive system => the fold/unfold, support for interactive applets, etcetera</li></ul><p>Hugo has &ldquo;shortcodes&rdquo;. This allows reusing pieces of code in a markdown (<code>.md</code>) file.</p><p>As such, I created shortcodes for al the common styling elements and wrapped them around the rules. Most notable, I created <code>rules-folded</code>. I wrap this around every unique section. Then, Hugo simply feeds that into my shortcode, which generates the HTML markup needed for the folded sections.</p><p>The same thing happens for all other common elements.</p><p>This sounds easy. In practice, it was quite a journey to find this system and make it work. I had two issues</p><ul><li>Rules shouldn&rsquo;t all look identical. I needed a common skeleton, but also enough <em>freedom</em> to change rules to fit the game. (In other words, elements such as fonts, colors, size of headings, and all that needed to be easily customizable.)</li><li>I can&rsquo;t magically convert an interactive web page to a PDF :p</li></ul><p>Without extra work, Paged.js would create a PDF that merely showed my folded sections. Pretty useless, right?</p><p>I needed to <em>separate</em> it into two style sets.</p><ul><li><strong>Screen</strong>: applies the styles and script necessary for the interactive version</li><li><strong>Print</strong>: applies some different styles to get the page ready for a proper printed version</li></ul><p>This distinction is literally drawn using these keywords in CSS: <code>@media screen</code> and <code>@media print</code>. But I still needed to figure this out and find the right setup for it.</p><p>Therefore, there was a pretty dark period between &ldquo;hey let&rsquo;s modernize my rulebooks&rdquo; and &ldquo;yes, this works great&rdquo; within which I constantly doubted how achievable the idea was. But I know that this happens on <em>every</em> new or innovative idea, so I pushed through.</p><h2 id=improving-the-concept>Improving the concept</h2><h3 id=remarks>Remarks</h3><p>One thing that always bugs me about designing websites / for screens, is the wasted horizontal space.</p><p>To keep text nicely readable and centered, it needs to be quite narrow. This means that, on a typical laptop/desktop, you have <em>tons</em> of empty space on the sides. While the page grows taller and taller!</p><p>The solution came to me when I added a few &ldquo;remarks&rdquo; to the first rulebook created this way. There are always tiny reminders for readers, or clarifications, which just aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;important&rdquo; enough to put in the main text.</p><p>Then I realized: we can put them to the side. In the side margin! On small screens (phones) they go inside the regular text again.</p><p>I loved this so much, that I started using remarks a bit more. It just works so well:</p><ul><li>The main text for the rulebook is short and sweet. No wasted sentence, to-the-point, etcetera</li><li>But you can still add some flair and some certainty, which will also look <em>good</em> when printed. (Because putting stuff inside the left/right margin is really meant for printed books.)</li></ul><h3 id=clickable-icons>Clickable icons</h3><p>Many games have a list of &ldquo;things&rdquo;. For example, if you have a card game with 10 different types of cards, there needs to be a <em>table</em> or <em>overview</em> somewhere with all those types.</p><p>So, as expected, I created a dedicated system for that. It lays out the &ldquo;things&rdquo; with an icon, header, and description.</p><p>At first, though, only the icons show (in a tight grid). Click on one to expand it and show what it means.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>Also, all images can be clicked to become fullscreen. But that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;given&rdquo; in my eyes.</p></aside><p>These rulebooks <em>really</em> try to hide any information you don&rsquo;t want. So it&rsquo;s not overwhelming. And you can focus on the stuff you <em>do</em> want.</p><h3 id=interactive-examples>Interactive Examples</h3><p>Yes, as I expected, the &ldquo;interactive examples&rdquo; are easy to code. I created a system for that, so I can plug in <em>any</em> piece of JavaScript code easily.</p><p>For the first game with an interactive rulebook&mdash;<a href=https://pandaqi.com/keebble-games/spell/keebble/>Keebble</a>&mdash;this meant a generator that simulates one whole turn. It took 30 minutes to write, takes into account any rules or exceptions that might occur, and prints ~3 easily readable paragraphs.</p><p>Honestly, you can just click that button a few times to learn the game, and ignore the rest of the rules :p</p><p>I&rsquo;m researching creating videos/animations using the <a href=https://motioncanvas.io/>MotionCanvas</a> system. It&rsquo;s free, open source, and focuses on animation through <em>code</em> and <em>vectors</em>. My laptop is so old it literally cannot run any video editor. I can code better than I can animate. So it seems the best fit. For now, though, it remains a stretch goal.</p><h2 id=where-to-go-from-here>Where to go from here?</h2><p>Want to see it in action? Check the <a href=https://pandaqi.com/keebble-games/spell/keebble/rules/>rules for Keebble</a>, the first game to use this system. Any feedback, as always, is appreciated.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve only created a few rulebooks this way. The future is uncertain&mdash;as always.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m loving it so far. Once I was able to turn my perspective on rulebooks upside down, I realized how powerful the web is, and how powerful interactive rulebooks are.</p><p>More and more, I refine my system. And I find ways to slip those stretch goals (animation or interactive buttons) into rules.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t see myself making a purely PDF rulebook anytime soon. Maybe for <em>really</em> complex games &mldr; but I don&rsquo;t see myself making those, ever.</p><p>My dream would be to make videos as well. Record the game as it&rsquo;s played by a group. But due to health issues, I can&rsquo;t do long videos in which I talk (and explain the rules), nor long sessions with others.</p><aside class="remark masked-link-block"><span class=label>Remark ||</span><p>And most people don&rsquo;t want to be filmed or talk English just for the video :p I&rsquo;m Dutch, by the way. So everybody here <em>can</em> talk English, but only do so if absolutely necessary.</p></aside><p>Let&rsquo;s keep that as a stretch goal for the future. For now, I think my free games have become more professional and accessible year after year.</p></div></article><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/pandaqi-games-2023-update/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-5" style=--rotation:0deg>&lt;&lt; Previous Page</a></li><li>Continue reading</li><li><a href=/blog/news-and-updates/bamboo-my-own-coding-language/ class="masked-link big-mask mask-3" style=--rotation:-1deg>>> Next Page</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><footer id=site-footer><div class="padding center-block"><h3>More Pandaqi</h3><p>You could <a href=https://pandaqi.com>visit the game studio</a>.
