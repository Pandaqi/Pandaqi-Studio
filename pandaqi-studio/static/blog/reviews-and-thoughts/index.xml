Both to improve it and to create a few &amp;ldquo;spin-offs&amp;rdquo; based on the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Communication is a Game Developer's greatest skill</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/communication-is-a-devs-greatest-skill/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/communication-is-a-devs-greatest-skill/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I must admit that this article was originally conceived because of a frustrating experience I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t let go.

Once you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it for a while, however, you naturally progress to asking the question: &amp;ldquo;how on earth should I structure or approach a bigger project?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hard Lessons Learned from Bombgoggles</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/lessons-from-bombgoggles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/lessons-from-bombgoggles/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I participated in ~10 game jams. Most of the games I submitted ended up quite good and received high ratings. The worst one, by far, was &lt;em&gt;Bombgoggles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Problem of Dreamshrink</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-problem-of-dreamshrink/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-problem-of-dreamshrink/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every idea for a creative project starts full of opportunities. This is nice. You feel motivated, you&amp;rsquo;re interested to see where all these ideas lead, and you feel creatively fulfilled. You write down more and more ideas every hour, while you start implementing/executing the first ones, and you&amp;rsquo;re still dreaming of creating your masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why everyone should use static typing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/why-everyone-should-use-static-typing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/why-everyone-should-use-static-typing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to learn programming or pick a programming language for your next project.

I ended up joining nearly 10 of them, and submitting for most, which was quite stressful and I probably should&amp;rsquo;ve actually taken a &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, this obviously taught me a lot about game design and gave me some new insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Summer of Game Jams (2024)</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-summer-of-game-jams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/the-summer-of-game-jams/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2024, I quite spontaneously participated in 10 game jams over a period of a few weeks. I just picked the ones that seemed reasonable well-hosted and started/ended within my self-assigned summer break. And when I say spontaneous, I really mean it. I&amp;rsquo;d actually planned something entirely different, but, well, things happened, and before I knew it September had started and I&amp;rsquo;d made a dozen video games.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Thoughts on Defold Engine</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/my-thoughts-on-defold-engine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/my-thoughts-on-defold-engine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a review of the game engine, as I think that&amp;rsquo;s not terribly useful.

About 10% of them are strategical simulations such as Rollercoaster Tycoon (and recently Parkitect, of course), and the other 90% are local coop games such as Overcooked and Towerfall.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Should you let your kids win?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/should-you-let-your-kids-win/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/should-you-let-your-kids-win/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A recurring issue when playing games is a skill gap. This is most common when parents play a game with their kids, but also happens for example when people with different levels of gaming experience (in general) approach a game.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why rules should be less strict</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/why-rules-should-be-less-strict/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/why-rules-should-be-less-strict/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning, explaining, testing and designing board games for a long while now. You can comfortably call me a real gamer, a &amp;ldquo;seasoned gamer&amp;rdquo;, a heavy gamer.

I explain where I find my fonts, but mostly about &lt;em&gt;licensing&lt;/em&gt; and things to look out for. Because I&amp;mdash;like many&amp;mdash;learned about this way too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Solar2D - Success &amp; Horror Stories</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/solar2d-success-and-horror-stories/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 18:20:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/blog/reviews-and-thoughts/solar2d-success-and-horror-stories/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article is an addition to my &lt;strong&gt;review of the Solar2D game engine&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Formerly, this engine was known as the Corona engine. But they changed the name for two good reasons: the &amp;ldquo;Corona Virus&amp;rdquo; struck the world and created some negative connotations to their name, and they decided to go fully free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
