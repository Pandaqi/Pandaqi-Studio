If we do the same thing a few mornings in a row, it has now become a habit. Our body / mind <em>expects</em> it now. We can&rsquo;t start the day without it. Even if it&rsquo;s absolutely not relevant anymore.</p><p>Conversely, if we don&rsquo;t perform our habits every day, we quickly lose them and forget about them.</p><p>This is the difference between habits and discipline. We <em>like</em> habits. We feel <em>good</em> for executing them.</p><p>At the same time, we don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s a <em>burden</em> or <em>too complicated</em>. Most habits are just a tiny activity that doesn&rsquo;t mean much on any single day. Their power comes from the repetition: doing that tiny good thing <em>every day</em> for a longer time.</p><h2 id=the-important-graph>The important graph</h2><p>Remember this graph for the rest of your life.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>The discipline gap: memory and results are inverse.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=memory_vs_results.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The discipline gap: memory and results are inverse." title="The discipline gap: memory and results are inverse." width=950 height=372></picture></figure></p><p>This is the reason why habits are amazing, yet people think they are useless.</p><ul><li>Our <em>memory</em> degrades over time. When we&rsquo;ve just done something, our head is filled with that information. But if you&rsquo;ve done something every day for the past year, you won&rsquo;t remember all that.</li><li>But <em>results</em> only get stronger over time. When you&rsquo;ve just exercised, you&rsquo;re not immediately more muscular. But if you&rsquo;ve exercises every day for the past year, you&rsquo;re way more fit than when you started.</li></ul><p>The first few weeks of trying a new habit, you <em>will</em> have this thought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing this every day! And nothing&rsquo;s happening! This is stupid, I quit.&rdquo;</p><p>Ignore it. The graph above clearly explains why this happens, and why it&rsquo;s wrong.</p><p>If you get past that stage, your brain will change the message: &ldquo;Huh, my muscles are quite nice. But I haven&rsquo;t even exercised that much?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve forgotten all the effort, but the results are significant now.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I keep using exercise / visual fitness as an example, because it&rsquo;s just very easy and general. This works for <em>anything</em>.</p></div><h2 id=tiny-steps-have-use-results>Tiny steps have use results</h2><p>And to achieve this, the steps you take can be <em>really really small</em>. A tiny improvement a day, will lead to huge improvement over a year.</p><p>Like this other graph. (I promise, after this we&rsquo;re done with graphs.)</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>The time buff: consistency over time is always better than infrequent huge jumps.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=small_step_each_day.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The time buff: consistency over time is always better than infrequent huge jumps." title="The time buff: consistency over time is always better than infrequent huge jumps." width=950 height=372></picture></figure></p><p><em>How is this calculated</em>? A 1% improvement means multiplying by <code>1.01</code>. If you do this 365 times, a full year, you take that number to the power <code>365</code>. This yields roughly <code>37.8</code>. This is not a near 40% improvement, it&rsquo;s 4000%.</p><p>Below I will give more explanation and detail about what that &ldquo;1%&rdquo; might mean to you. But an easy way to find it, is by simply calculating <em>time</em> (or other numbers related to the habit).</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you lift weights every day. Normally, it would take you 10 minutes to go through your exercises. Improving by 1%, means you do the same exercises faster: in six fewer seconds. That&rsquo;s achievable, right?</p><p>Or, normally you&rsquo;d use 5kg weights. Adding 1% means you now use 5.05kg weights.</p><p>It will be hard to find fitness material with such granular level of control ðŸ˜† But you get the idea.</p><p>In this case, you can compound the effect. Once every <em>ten days</em>, increase your weights by 0.5kg. (Because, <code>5 x 1.01^10</code> =~ <code>5.5</code>.)</p><h2 id=how-to-build-good-habits>How to build good habits</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the trick.</p><blockquote><p>Make your task simpler and simpler, until it&rsquo;s so simple that you don&rsquo;t have much reason <strong>not</strong> to do it anymore.</p></blockquote><p>Once you&rsquo;ve done something several days in a row, it has become a habit. Once it&rsquo;s a habit, you can change and improve it.</p><p>But you need to get over that first hurdle.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You want to exercise each day. If you look online, you find training schedules and exercise sets. This is probably <em>too much</em>. You will not find the motivation to build that habit.</p><p>Instead, find the absolute <em>smallest</em> set of exercise that you&rsquo;re willing to do. If that is just a <em>single push up</em>, then that&rsquo;s what it is. If you can&rsquo;t run for more than a minute&mdash;so be it.</p></div><p>This is perhaps the most powerful statement in this guide. The most important thing in <em>any</em> activity, is the fact that you will be able to do it again tomorrow.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Many websites state that you &ldquo;should&rdquo; eat in the morning, because it&rsquo;s healthier. Actual health experts don&rsquo;t do this. They say &ldquo;pick whatever moment that makes it easiest for you to <em>eat healthy</em>&rdquo;.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not hungry in the morning, or never motivated to pick healthy options, don&rsquo;t force yourself to eat in the morning. Form your habits around something that you can maintain.</p></div><h2 id=how-to-get-rid-of-bad-habits>How to get rid of bad habits</h2><p>The first step is obviously to <em>identify</em> those bad habits. They often sneak up on you, unseen and unwanted. They are often the result of <em>systems</em> around you, like the education system in which most people are forced to spend their whole youth.</p><p>How to get rid of them? The exact same way as learning a new habit.</p><blockquote><p>Find the smallest change in the habit that you can execute. Repeat until the habit has become so small and irrelevant, you can eliminate it entirely.</p></blockquote><p>This takes time. This takes conscious effort. Maybe you have to write it down on a piece of paper: the specific tiny steps you&rsquo;ll take until the habit is gone.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I used to drink lemonade and other sugary drinks the whole day. It was very unhealthy, to say the least. But I couldn&rsquo;t stop it. My body craved that sugar, couldn&rsquo;t concentrate until I&rsquo;d executed my <em>habit</em> of drinking sweet stuff.</p><p>How did I remove it? By swapping <em>one</em> glass of lemonade for a glass of water. I could do that. I maintained that for a week. Then I swapped another glass for water. I repeated that for a few weeks, until I was suddenly drinking water all day. Within a month, I removed this extremely unhealthy habit from my life, completely.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Our education system is very good at teaching completely unhealthy and useless habits when it comes to learning. For example, it teaches you that you have <em>one chance</em> to pass something, to show what you can do, and that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>The consequence? I could never finish anything, because it had to be <em>perfect</em>, and I only had <em>one chance</em> to show the world.</p><p>How did I lose this? I noticed that I could pick an idea I thought was <em>bad</em> and create a very <em>tiny project</em> from that. Because I wasn&rsquo;t so invested, I had no trouble doing multiple versions, just trying stuff and publishing it online. It was a throwaway idea.</p><p>After I did this for ~5 projects, my habit of perfectionism and &ldquo;I have only one chance&rdquo; was gone.</p></div><h2 id=what-are-good-habits>What are good habits?</h2><p>Ah, that&rsquo;s basically the rest of this guide. Specific examples of habits and tricks that worked for me, or which are recommended by science.</p><p>Spoiler: they are <em>not</em> the things that most schools teach you or that parents try to teach their children. Unfortunately.</p><p>But first, we can take this one step further. What&rsquo;s even better than habits?
