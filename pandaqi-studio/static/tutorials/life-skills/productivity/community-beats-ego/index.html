People are <em>social</em> beings. It&rsquo;s hard for us to do things on our own, for ourselves, in isolation.</p><p>Instead, many articles on productivity will advice you to <em>announce</em> your goals or projects, so other people hold you accountable. They will advice you to seek validation and support outside of your own head.</p><p>This is partially useful, and partially a big trap.</p><p>Yes, other people can help you to keep going. They can give objective feedback, when you see everything through a colored subjective lens. (If you think you&rsquo;re fat, you&rsquo;re going to look in the mirror and find every reason to confirm you&rsquo;re fat. Others might simply look at you and think you&rsquo;re not fat.)</p><p>Yes, people are motivated and happier when they have strong social relationships. People do really well on <em>responsibility</em>. If they&rsquo;re afraid to let someone else down, they will not complain and do the work.</p><p>At the same time &mldr; most other people don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p><p>Harsh words, I know. But you&rsquo;re not the center of the universe. If you announce your goals, others will likely say &ldquo;sure, great,&rdquo; and continue with their lives. Don&rsquo;t expect <em>them</em> to carry <em>you</em>. Don&rsquo;t expect them to be as involved with your project as you are. Most of the time, nobody is even waiting on that project you&rsquo;re making, nobody even cares if you are healthy or not.</p><p>That&rsquo;s simply the reality.</p><p>And seeking validation then, trying to build your motivation on the shoulders of <em>others</em>, will merely lead to more disappointment and sadness.</p><p>Clearly, there&rsquo;s a balance here. It took me a long time to find that balance. And it might be different for everyone, it might depend on what productivity means to you.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ll just share my own journey and what I&rsquo;ve learned.</p><h2 id=you-dont-have-to-believe-in-yourself>You don&rsquo;t have to believe in yourself</h2><p>It has become a sort of motto for artists worldwide: &ldquo;my greatest enemy is crippling self-doubt&rdquo;</p><p>Many people recognize themselves in that statement. You constantly feel the imposter syndrome. You look at your own work, compare it to the finished product of professionals, and think you&rsquo;re incompotent and shouldn&rsquo;t even try anymore.</p><p>This <em>does not go away</em>. No moving speech, no self-help book, no amount of succes will make this go away. Anyone with ambition will always strive for more and look to bigger futures. Don&rsquo;t expect that everything will fall into place once you&rsquo;ve removed the self-doubt, once you &ldquo;believe in yourself&rdquo;.</p><p>Instead, you just have to <em>ignore this</em>. I don&rsquo;t know who said it, but I once read: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to believe in yourself. You just need to put in the work.&rdquo;</p><p>Take belief out of the equation. Don&rsquo;t expect you to believe in yourself. Don&rsquo;t expect a community to magically form around you and believe in you. Belief is not important.</p><p>Just put in the work.</p><p>Put in the work, and the community <em>will come</em>. Once you&rsquo;ve done some things, others will find it and be impressed. They will see what you cannot see. They will show you how far you&rsquo;ve come, how productive you&rsquo;ve been.</p><p>Again, you almost can <em>not</em> see this yourself. You <em>need</em> outsiders to reveal or confirm this for you.</p><p>But that can only happen if you&rsquo;ve <em>done the thing you wanted to do</em> for a long enough time.</p><h2 id=publish-fast-publish-early>Publish fast, publish early</h2><p>So yes, community is crucial. They give feedback. They support you when you can&rsquo;t support yourself. They see things you cannot see anymore.</p><p>But again, the community cannot come if you don&rsquo;t <em>put stuff out there</em>. Let others know your goals. Let others know what you&rsquo;re trying to do. But also actually <em>do</em> it. Also share the final product, something that comes close to the goal, as early as possible.</p><p>This is a common mistake with game developers. They work on their game in isolation, almost in secret, for <em>years</em>. And then they either lose motivation and quit, or they release it thinking it&rsquo;s ready &mldr; and it&rsquo;s not ready at all.</p><p>If developers share their progress, it&rsquo;s usually in vague terms. They show some progress. They state a few development plans for the next month. This is <em>not enough</em>.</p><p>Build something. As soon as it <em>somewhat works</em>, start sharing it with people, start talking about it. Publish fast and early.</p><p>I give a lot of examples that show productivity through projects and creative products. But the same is true for other goals, like improving your health, or gaining other (soft) skills.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no need to work on that in secret.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I&rsquo;ve had trouble using my voice and speaking clearly for years, due to my chronic illness. I made the mistake of hiding this, which is doubly stupid, as people can <em>hear</em> you having trouble!</p><p>Instead, let people know. Say you are working on it. Ask them to give feedback, when they can&rsquo;t understand you, or something else is wrong. As people learn what you&rsquo;re doing, they will also automatically point out <em>progress</em> or <em>good things</em>. They might <em>ask</em> how it&rsquo;s going.</p><p>Those tiny moments of community and social validation are <em>amazing</em> for getting things done and keeping the momentum.</p></div><h2 id=fail-big-fail-publicly>Fail big, fail publicly</h2><p>This is related to the first point. Naturally, people are cautious when sharing, cautious when making statements.</p><p>While I don&rsquo;t advocate pretending you&rsquo;re amazing, or lying to yourself and others, it <em>is</em> recommended to &ldquo;fail big&rdquo;.</p><p>Why? The bigger the fail, the more you learn. But also, the bigger the risk, the more incentive you have to not screw it up or abandon the goal.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to give up a creative project if all you&rsquo;ve invested is <em>time</em>. It&rsquo;s less easy if you&rsquo;ve invested a large sum of money. Or you&rsquo;ve clearly stated a deadline, on which your project is released, for a year now. Or you&rsquo;ve entered contracts with publishers, other parties, whatever.</p><p>Again, the reason community beats ago, is because humans work well with <strong>responsibility</strong>. The more responsibility you put on your shoulders, the more you will <strong>live up</strong> to the task. Quitting or falling back into bad habits isn&rsquo;t even an option anymore. Not shipping that product isn&rsquo;t even an option anymore.</p><p>This is one I still struggle with. I am still cautious when creating new projects. I keep them small. I don&rsquo;t build expectations, I invest nothing, I isolate myself to put in more hours of work. All good ideas &mldr; but they also make it hard to actually reach my goals, instead of giving up halfway or building something that was &ldquo;easier&rdquo; to make.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t <em>expect</em> or <em>require</em> community. In the end, it&rsquo;s a battle between <em>you</em> and the <em>task you want to accomplish</em>. The primary action and discipline will have to come from <em>you</em>. But put in the work, share all you do and think, and <em>accept</em> any community that comes your way.</p><p>This is general life advice, actually. <strong>Invite</strong> responsibility into your life. Enter projects or agreements which are a bit out of your comfort zone. Enter relationships, even when unsure if you can maintain them.</p><p>More often than not, people will rise to the occasion.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s why community beats ego.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/sleep-beats-all/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Sleep beats All</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/iteration-beats-perfectionism/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Iteration beats perfectionism</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
