They are mostly related to what worked for <em>me</em>. And the remark at the end is important!</p><h2 id=trick-continuous-self-validation>Trick: continuous self-validation</h2><p>Yes, the rewards of a habit are only visible after weeks or months. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that is your <em>only</em> data point.</p><p>While trying new habits, while doing stuff every day, keep an <em>objective journal</em> of your progress. Write down all you accomplished. Measure your weight. Measure how much you can lift. Measure how many words you&rsquo;ve written for that book.</p><p>When you feel down, look back at that journal. You&rsquo;ll see you did much more than you probably thought. That you were on a nice streak and you don&rsquo;t want to break it.</p><p>Why doesn&rsquo;t our brain remember this correctly? Because, again, our brain is very subjective. I mean, we can even <em>distort</em> memories or perception, simply because we&rsquo;re a bit hungry. Don&rsquo;t trust your brain, your moods, etcetera.</p><p>Write stuff down. Measure stuff objectively. Use it to track your progress and constantly validate that you&rsquo;re doing the right thing.</p><p>It also helps to remember <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re doing this.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;I want to lose weight, to reduce the risk of a serious disease.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I want to write this book, because I think the message is too important not to tell.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I want to do something that counts, because I care about leaving a legacy.&rdquo;</li></ul><h2 id=trick-your-future-self>Trick: your future self</h2><p>One thing that really helps <em>me</em>, is to ask: &ldquo;If I look back in a year, what would I wish I <em>had accomplished the past year</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>In other words, do something for your future self. Be productive so you can be happy about it in a year. So your future self can pick the fruits of that labor.</p><p>I often don&rsquo;t have motivation to work. I&rsquo;ll sit behind my laptop, toiling away at some idea with no certainty of income, no deadline, and wondering why I&rsquo;m doing this.</p><p>And then it really helps to say: &ldquo;In a few months time, I&rsquo;d <em>wish</em> I had finished this project. I would have wanted to complete this, so I could have learned form it, and started an even better project by now.&rdquo;</p><p>Your current self is probably feeling down, or sad, or tired. Don&rsquo;t let it make the decisions. Think about your future self, and how happy it will be that you were productive.</p><h2 id=trick-no-zero-days>Trick: no zero days</h2><p>This is another one that really helped me. I&rsquo;ve spoken about this with many specialists I visited over the years, and most of them could back this up.</p><p>Many people keep a schedule like</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll work on my hobby projects in the weekend&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I try to do work towards that goal two or three days a week&rdquo;</li></ul><p>And this is <em>fine</em>. But it&rsquo;s not optimal. By the time the weekend comes around again, you&rsquo;ve forgotten most of that hobby project, and need to waste a lot of time getting into it again.</p><p>Instead, establish your core goals, and establish habits so you work on them <em>every day</em>. No zero days. Don&rsquo;t break the chain.</p><p>This can be a tiny step. Like, really tiny. Sometimes, all I do for a book I&rsquo;m writing, is restructure my notes for 15 minutes, or write one paragraph somewhere. I might not have time for more that day. But at least I did <em>something</em>.</p><p>Our brains love this.</p><ul><li>We keep our momentum</li><li>Our head stays focused on the goal. We don&rsquo;t lose progress, we only build.</li><li>Daily habits are the strongest habits</li><li>It&rsquo;s been shown that our body and brain get an <em>extra</em> boost if you do something every day, if you really <em>immerse</em> yourself into it (without going overboard).</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I sometimes play tennis with my younger brother. This is infrequent: he actually plays tennis, I just tag along sometimes. Usually, this means I am rusty and inconsistent. But if we play 3+ days in a row? Then my skill suddenly gets a huge boost. It&rsquo;s like magic, again. Body and brain are now in &ldquo;tennis mode&rdquo; and somehow function more optimally for that.</p></div><h2 id=tips-for-people-with-add>Tips for people with ADD</h2><p>I have ADD. (This is probably no surprise.) I feel a relentless need to move, to think, to write, to create projects, every secod of every day.</p><p>But &mldr; many people with ADD really <em>struggle</em> to get things done. It&rsquo;s almost a paradox. The people with the most energy and intention to do stuff, are also scatterbrained and can&rsquo;t focus long enough to finish a task.</p><p>Because I wrote this guide, most of the tips are already applicable to you. But let me summarize and expand where needed.</p><ul><li>Multitasking doesn&rsquo;t work for us, because we are, sort of, always multitasking. Our head is always going many places. This leads to creativity and fun associations. So, force yourself to <em>really</em> &ldquo;single task&rdquo; anything you do.</li><li><strong>Write everything down.</strong> Even the tiniest tasks. Even the tiniest thoughts. Writing it down, means it can now move <em>out</em> of your busy head.</li><li>Take many short breaks, in which you do some physical exercise. Even better, stay active <em>while</em> working. I have a standing desk <em>and</em> stand on a &ldquo;balance board&rdquo; most of the day. Not only is it healthy, being physically active means my brain doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</li><li>Reduce sugar intake. Don&rsquo;t keep snacking while working. Every bit of energy you eat, is like a jolt into your brain / body, making it even harder to focus.</li><li>Vary your work. I can&rsquo;t work on the same thing for more than a few hours. On any given day, I might make progress on two or three projects. (Usually morning = main project, afternoon = another project, evening = another project if I have the energy.)</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s a sad thing. People with ADD are often categorized as troublemakers, as &ldquo;bad learners&rdquo;, even people with a &ldquo;learning disability&rdquo;. This is not true, at all. In fact, these people have hypercharged minds and bodies, making them <em>better</em> at thinking fast and acting on their thoughts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just our education system, and most of our corporate world, that has a rigid structure that doesn&rsquo;t fit what we want. That&rsquo;s also why many people with ADD&mdash;like me&mdash;start their own business. I&rsquo;m a freelance artist, because I&rsquo;ve never found a company that would allow me to work the way I <em>want</em> to work. Which is, again, sad. So much wasted potential, so much unnecessary hurt.</p><p>I am officially a Mathematical Engineer. But all those years at university, I caught flack from professors telling me I was studying wrong, and that my methods would &ldquo;not continue working&rdquo;. I barely opened a textbook. Instead, I wrote my own little books about each subject, and did <em>a lot</em> of exercising between study sessions. I connected every subject to something I was passionate about, something else that wandered around my brain, to be able to remember it.</p><p>When I was still at school (or university), I was forced to do sit still and do things their way. Since I left, my productivity skyrocketed. And the only change is that I was able to apply my own tips and habits that help focus and calm my brain.</p><p>All I want, is for everybody else to unlock their potential as well. And to know they are (probably) not in the wrong&mdash;our systems of education are.</p><h2 id=but-as-always>But as always</h2><p>Health comes first. All my tips and tricks will lead to more energy, more productivity, all sorts of habits around getting stuff done.</p><p>But the worst thing for productivity &mldr; is getting a burn-out and being forced to stop working or 6 months 😉</p><p>As I said, a good health improves everything. Sleep, rest, relaxation, they <em>are</em> actually magic bullets towards solving issues and gaining skills.</p><p>I recommend reading my courses on <a href=../../fitness-health/>Fitness & Health</a> for the details. But the summary is:</p><ul><li>Design your environment to stay <em>somewhat</em> active all day. (Like, a standing desk instead of a chair. Take the stairs instead of the elevator.)</li><li>Try to get 30-60 minutes of moderate-to-intense exercise every day.</li></ul><p>When in doubt: when pressed for time, give preference to hitting this health goal. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/excuses/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Excuses</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/conclusion/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Conclusion</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
