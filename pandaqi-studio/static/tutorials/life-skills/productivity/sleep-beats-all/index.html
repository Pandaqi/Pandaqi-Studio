Our mind and body work in wondrous ways. And their most important resource? <em>Time</em>.</p><p>Your muscles don&rsquo;t instantly grow larger after a training. This happens over time.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t instantly understand a tough new concept after reading it once. This happens over time.</p><h2 id=regular-breaks>Regular breaks</h2><p>The first lesson is a common one: regularly take breaks. I&rsquo;ve found this heavily depends on personal preference. Some people like to hyperfocus for a few hours, then take a long break. I fall in that camp.</p><p>Others take a tiny break every 15 minutes. Studies have shown, though, that the tiny breaks&mdash;the quick naps&mdash;are generally more effective.</p><p>Even short breaks can refill energy, motivation, inspiration. At least, use them to move around, keep your blood flowing, clear your head.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>It happens often that I&rsquo;m completely <em>stuck</em>. I have some issue, usually related to programming, and I just don&rsquo;t understand why it doesn&rsquo;t work. Trying to force a solution often yields nothing.</p><p>Instead, walking around for a minute, grabbing something to eat, watching a 10 minute YouTube video, does the trick. When my eyes first meet my code again, I <em>instantly</em> see the stupid mistake I made somewhere.</p></div><p>When taking a break, it&rsquo;s generally best to:</p><ul><li>Be physically active. Even stretching is good.</li><li>Actually take a <em>full</em> break. Don&rsquo;t go away from your computer screen for 10 minutes, just to keep working on your mobile screen.</li></ul><h2 id=sleep-is-magic>Sleep is magic</h2><p>The second lesson has even become part of our vocabulary. But subconsciously&mdash;most people don&rsquo;t actively recognize this lesson.</p><p>What happens when someone asks a tough question? Or a question for which you don&rsquo;t currently know the answer? You say: &ldquo;Let me sleep on it.&rdquo;</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>In Dutch, we say a similar thing: &ldquo;I will sleep on it for a few nights, then I&rsquo;ll get back to you.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Why? Because it works! Sleep is magic fairy dust for our brains.</p><ul><li>We store things in our long-term memory</li><li>Our brain keeps thinking about what we experienced</li><li>Or about what we planned to do tomorrow</li><li>And it tries to do all this by building associations and intuition between this problem, this new knowledge, and things you already know</li><li>(This is what dreams &ldquo;mean&rdquo;.)</li></ul><p>The best way to stay productive, is by recognizing when your head is full. Recognize when you&rsquo;ve hit the limit of your attention, your memory, your problem solving. And when that happens? Simply say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep on this.&rdquo; And do that.</p><p>But you need to <em>prime</em> your brain to think about the right things. While you sleep, your brain merely regurgitates what happened that day. If you haven&rsquo;t thought about your task for a second, it won&rsquo;t be touched on.</p><p>The best way to ensure sleep literally <em>does</em> solve your problems, is to:</p><ul><li>Actively work on something for a small amount of time during the day.</li><li>Write down your biggest issues, clearly, before going to bed.</li></ul><p>Keep a notepad next to your bed. Your best ideas and solutions <em>will</em> come right before you fall asleep, or right after you wake up. And you <em>will</em> forget them if you don&rsquo;t immediately write them down.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>When you read my devlogs, you&rsquo;ll often find sentences like: &ldquo;so I decided to pick it up again the next morning. I went to sleep, woke up, and TA DA: I had the solution&rdquo;</p><p>A good chunk of the hardest tasks to accomplish, the toughest (creative) problems to solve, were solved while I was asleep.</p></div><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to increase sleep quality, read my course on <a href=../../fitness-health/sleeping-hygiene/>Sleeping Hygiene</a>.</p><h2 id=brain-waves>Brain waves</h2><p>In general, we distinguish four &ldquo;states of mind&rdquo;:</p><ul><li>Alpha brain waves</li><li>Beta brain waves</li><li>Theta brain waves</li><li>Delta brain waves</li></ul><p>Delta and Theta only happen when you&rsquo;re asleep. Look up research on them, and you will see just how important and magical sleep is.</p><p>Beta waves are present when you&rsquo;re fully awake and active. Alpha waves happen when you&rsquo;re awake, but calm and at rest.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s a transition period between these.</p><p>This means the moment right after you wake up, is similarly magical. There&rsquo;s this phase of about 30 minutes in which you are awake, but still in that &ldquo;dream&rdquo; or &ldquo;subconscious&rdquo; state.</p><p>You guessed it: this is when you are most creative and find the best solutions.</p><p>You are also at your most vulnerable. If you have a bad experience during this time, it can easily ruin your whole day. If you immediately think negative thoughts, they will ruin your whole day.</p><p>Remember that earlier chapter called &ldquo;first beats last&rdquo;. This is another reason why that is true. Do the good thing right after you wake up, and you&rsquo;re set for the rest of the day. Don&rsquo;t do it, and you&rsquo;ve already ruined your day.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/first-beats-last/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>First beats Last</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/community-beats-ego/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Community beats Ego</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
