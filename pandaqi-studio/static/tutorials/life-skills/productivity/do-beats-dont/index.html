Doubt is the killer of all human dreams. It&rsquo;s certainly the killer of many things in my life, both in terms of productivity and life choices.</p><p>We have this miraculous ability&mdash;to doubt&mdash;because we can see futures and reason about them. A dog, for example, sees something and has an instant reaction. Food? Eat. Toy? Play. Tired? Sleep.</p><p>We think much further ahead. We try to predict consequences. We try to <em>design</em> where we want to be in a year from now.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I still constantly have doubts about what I&rsquo;m doing. As an artist, I always have more ideas than time. I have great ideas for books &mldr; but also for games, and for websites, and so forth. Which one do I choose? Doubt like that easily kills any motivation or momentum, because even if you <em>are</em> productive, you are questioning if you are doing <em>the right thing</em>.</p></div><p>As I mentioned last chapter, though, we cannot predict the future. At least, not the far future.</p><p>When doubt appears about something that is relevant <em>now</em>, then yes, doubt is relevant. Don&rsquo;t ignore it. You have a choice <em>now</em> and need to figure out the right one.</p><p>When doubt appears about something further ahead, ignore it. It&rsquo;s nothing more than wasting time. You can&rsquo;t predict the future any better by <em>waiting</em>.</p><p>You know what <em>does</em> help make decisions? <strong>Getting more information.</strong> And you can only get more information by <em>doing</em> something.</p><blockquote><p>When in doubt, pick anything and do it. Then reflect later if it was the right thing. If so, continue. Otherwise, do something <em>else</em>.</p></blockquote><h2 id=prototyping>Prototyping</h2><p>I usually prototype my projects for this reason.</p><p>When you get a new idea, it always <em>feels</em> exciting. This is what you should be working on! Not that other project you&rsquo;re currently doing! Go do the new thing!</p><p>But the process from idea to execution is long and dangerous. By simply <em>trying</em> the new idea for a day or two, you get much more information. Is it actually good? Is it more difficult than I thought? Is it worth it?</p><blockquote><p>Action destroys doubt.</p></blockquote><p>Even if your prototype ends up shit and you are disappointed your idea doesn&rsquo;t work, <strong>now you know</strong>. You don&rsquo;t have to have doubts about it. You aren&rsquo;t distracted by it. You know your current project is indeed the best choice, so you continue.</p><h2 id=certain-tasks-vs-creative-tasks>Certain tasks vs Creative tasks</h2><p>I learned to divide tasks into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Certain tasks</strong>: you&rsquo;re certain you have to do this. There&rsquo;s no creativity, no guesswork, nothing yet to be determined. It just has to be done.</li><li><strong>Creative tasks</strong>: you have to figure something out, find a solution for a problem, you&rsquo;re not sure <em>how</em> to do the task.</li></ul><p>The second type is much more exciting. When I make a game, I do so because I love inventing new systems, drawing cool icons, getting my idea working. I love the <em>creative</em> work.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I do first. Or, that&rsquo;s what I <em>try</em> to do first.</p><p>But inspiration doesn&rsquo;t always come. The well of creativity runs dry, especially after a few hours.</p><p>It&rsquo;s useless to keep banging your head against that wall.</p><p>What to do?</p><blockquote><p>When your creative tasks come to a halt, switch to certain tasks.</p></blockquote><p>Recognize when you don&rsquo;t have the energy or inspiration anymore. Recognize when that mountain is too high to climb. If so, ignore all your creative tasks, and switch to the easy and certain ones.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I often write devlogs for my projects, especially the games. Why? It&rsquo;s a certain task. I can <em>always</em> write a bit to explain what I&rsquo;ve already done. To copy-paste some code I already wrote. There&rsquo;s almost no creativity or uncertainty there.</p><p>So when I can&rsquo;t figure out a problem for my game &mldr; I write the devlog, maybe write about this problem as well and possible solutions. It&rsquo;s still productive and keeps the momentum up.</p></div><h2 id=the-take-away>The take-away</h2><p>Any time a human wants to do something, thoughts like &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t I do that other thing?&rdquo; or &ldquo;why would I even do this, why go through the effort&rdquo; pop up.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t completely <em>ignore</em> them. That&rsquo;s what our harsh &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; would do: ignore doubt, ignore feelings, just <em>force</em> yourself through something.</p><p>Also don&rsquo;t <em>give in</em> to them. As explained, it yields <em>nothing</em>.</p><p>Instead,</p><ul><li>Either pick any of the options and <em>do it</em>. Get more information, so you can stop doubting.</li><li>Or switch to <em>certain tasks</em> that won&rsquo;t lead to doubt.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>At the start of the course, I shared my portfolio. I mentioned how full it was, despite only being active as a freelance artist for a few years. I was very productive. I finished many projects.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have genes that prevent me from doubting. I don&rsquo;t think all my decisions were the best ones. In fact, many of the earlier projects are full of mistakes, missed opportunities, and so forth.</p><p>But I made them. I did <em>something</em>, which allowed me to finish projects, and make <em>better</em> choices in the future. It&rsquo;s all that counts. In fact, I often received responses that showed <em>others</em> did not see the mistakes that I clearly see and have doubts about.</p></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/small-beats-big/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Small beats big</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/productivity/first-beats-last/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>First beats Last</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
