You know exactly what you&rsquo;ll be looking at, because you <em>focus</em> on that thing. You know, when you wake up, that you&rsquo;ll read the same chapters of your textbook as last time.</p><p>An even better example is in <em>physical training</em>. Predictable training would be an exercise like this,</p><ul><li>Your coach throws the ball at you from the same position, in the same way, each time</li><li>You need to hit it with your baseball bat</li><li>Repeat this 20 times</li></ul><p>You <em>know</em> exactly how and when the ball comes. It is predictable. Well, the tip below will also be predictable by now.</p><blockquote><p>Random learning is more effective than predictable learning</p></blockquote><h2 id=whats-the-difference>What&rsquo;s the difference?</h2><p>I explained <strong>Predictable Learning</strong> above. You know what you&rsquo;re going to get or how you have to solve something. You just need to <em>do</em> it, using the right movements or steps.</p><p><strong>Varied Learning</strong> means you don&rsquo;t know exactly what you&rsquo;re going to get. The exercise is to hit the ball, but how will it be thrown? Fast? Slow? Curve? From where? You don&rsquo;t know. There is <em>variety</em> and some <em>unknowns</em> to your learning.</p><p>Research shows this to be significantly more effective.</p><p>With predictable learning, you&rsquo;re strengthening the thing you already have. Repeating the (physical) habit you already do. This means there&rsquo;s on <em>experimentation</em>, no significant <em>challenge</em>, and all your <em>feedback</em> is the same.</p><p>With varied learning, you get all these good things for free. You experiment with how to consume information, or how to deal with situations you&rsquo;ve never seen before. That is a challenge, as there are gaps in your knowledge and you need to process what&rsquo;s happening. (If the ball comes at you the same way each time, you stop looking at the ball and just assume it will be in some place.) And your <em>feedback</em> can come in surprising ways.</p><p>Note, again, that this is not <strong>random learning</strong>. You&rsquo;re still certain that a ball will be thrown at you and that you need to hit it. The coach doesn&rsquo;t suddenly roll a bowling ball from behind and expect you to jump over it. That would be a <em>random</em> challenge&mdash;one which probably results in injuries and losing members of the team.</p><h2 id=why-dont-people-do-it>Why don&rsquo;t people do it?</h2><p>The same answer as in the <a href=../spaced-versus-focused/>previous chapter</a>. It&rsquo;s more messy, it&rsquo;s less controlled, it&rsquo;s more work. School likes predictable learning&mdash;but ignore school.</p><p>If you train one specific swing, from one specific throw, every day &mldr; you&rsquo;re going to be amazing at that thing in a few weeks. That&rsquo;s tangible progress. You see yourself striking the ball harder and with more confidence each session.</p><p>But any other ball? Any other situation in that game? You&rsquo;re hopeless.</p><p>If you train in varied ways, you&rsquo;ll often be confronted with situations that you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> handle. Balls you hopelessly miss, because they came in unexpected ways. This can be demotivating or frustrating.</p><p>But trust the process. Throw varied challenges at yourself. The fact you can&rsquo;t do something <em>now</em>, means you&rsquo;ve just entered an area of great potential growth.</p><h2 id=a-tip-build-your-campaign-again>A tip: build your campaign (again)</h2><p><a href=../spaced-versus-focused/>Previous chapter</a> already showed you how to incorporate this&mdash;mostly. By looping through different training sessions, you get variety.</p><p>But we can go a bit further now. If possible, <em>randomize</em> your training process or challenges.</p><p>With physical sports, you can design situations that lead to unpredictable results. For example, one of the walls of our house is very rough and uneven. If I hit a ball against it, there&rsquo;s a good chance it bounces in some weird way. After years of playing in the back yard, this turned out to be <em>amazing</em> training. When playing any ball sport, I can usually predict where it will end up (and react) faster than people who play the actual sport.</p><p>With other topics, you can do the same, but it might take more effort. You need a <em>computer</em> (or some other person) to randomize your challenges. (Because, well, if you do it yourself &mldr; it&rsquo;s still predictable!)</p><p>This is, again, why board games and video games are great. They usually have a lot of randomness.</p><ul><li>How the world is generated</li><li>How a deck of cards is shuffled and dealt</li><li>The turns other players take (and how that affects you)</li><li>How much damage you deal with attacks</li><li>Where a monster spawns</li><li>What items you find in the world</li><li>Etcetera &mldr;</li></ul><p>You still follow <em>the rules of the game</em>. Your object is the same and predictable. It&rsquo;s just that a large part of the game loop is varied and unpredictable.</p><p>This is the second reason I recommend <strong>learning to program</strong>. You can use that in many ways to challenge yourself. For example,</p><ul><li>Write quizzes. It asks you a random subset of questions. Or the questions itself can be randomized (if they have numbers, for example)</li><li>Create a website for the topic you&rsquo;re learning. Each day, press a button to display a <em>random page</em> from that website. Read that.</li><li>Create a tiny game with random setups. One that&rsquo;s about whatever you&rsquo;re learning.</li></ul><p>If this isn&rsquo;t possible, or too much work, look for existing tools that do this. There are many websites, apps, games that focus on a gamified (and randomized) version of studying a topic.</p><h2 id=example-sports-coaches>Example: sports coaches</h2><p>Most sports coaches I talked to in my life, subscribed to this principle. They had numerous stories about students who would be <em>exceptionally good</em> during the exercises. In the &ldquo;ideal situation&rdquo;, for example, they could that tennis ball amazingly well.</p><p>But then, after years of training, they felt confident and entered competition.</p><p>There they learned that they were hopeless in an actual match. Because each match produces thousands of situations you&rsquo;ve never (or barely) seen before. Because your brain is trained to do <em>a few swings very well</em>, instead of the better training method of <em>gaining a general understanding of a skill that can be applied to anything</em>.</p><p>Usually, this prompted the coaches to swap out half of their training session for playing matches against random opponents. Sometimes with extra random challenges. (Serve must come <em>there</em>, you may only touch the soccer ball once, etcetera.)</p><h2 id=example-pick-your-projects>Example: pick your projects</h2><p>Like with experimentation, a large part of this is decided <em>before</em> you do something. Pick topics or skills that <em>allow</em> you to gamify it this way. Pick projects about which you are <em>uncertain</em>&mdash;on purpose!</p><p>Sometimes those bad ideas end up being bad ideas indeed. But quite often, I did such a project and grew in unexpected ways. I started that project thinking &ldquo;meh, don&rsquo;t know what this would accomplish, but it&rsquo;s something new to try&rdquo;. I ended up learning a lot.</p><p>Afterwards, though, I do always feel the need to go back to a more predictable path for a few weeks. Because it&rsquo;s varied learning, not random learning.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/spaced-versus-focused/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Spaced versus Focused</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/mind-versus-body/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Mind versus Body</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
