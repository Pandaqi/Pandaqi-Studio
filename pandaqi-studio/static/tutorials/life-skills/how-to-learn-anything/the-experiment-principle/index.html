The other principles might have seem tough. They require some discipline, some training, some other skills. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone on earth will find the fun with this principle. We humans <em>love</em> trying new things, experimenting, thinking &ldquo;but what if I did X instead?!&rdquo;</p><p>And that&rsquo;s good, because it&rsquo;s necessary for learning. If you just do the same thing over and over, you get very good at that <em>one thing</em> and nothing else. If you&rsquo;re lucky, it was a good habit that will serve you somewhat well. If you&rsquo;re unlucky, that one thing you tried is a bad habit that does you no good.</p><p>To prevent luck of the draw deciding your life, <em>try many things</em>. Sure, if something clearly works for you, stick with it. But always keep <em>some</em> part of your routine and habits open for experimentation.</p><p>I follow the 80/20 rule here. Follow a routine or plan that works for you 80% of the time, but leave that other 20% for trying new things and doing something unexpected. (This is a general guideline, of course. I don&rsquo;t stick to these numbers <em>exactly</em>, if that&rsquo;s even possible.)</p><p>About 1 out of 5 times, you should start a thought with: &ldquo;I wonder &mldr; what if we did X &mldr; would that even work &mldr; hmm &mldr;&rdquo; And then you try that.</p><h2 id=during-analysis>During analysis</h2><p>Experimentation already comes into play, partially, during the feedback principle.</p><p>When you list all <em>possible solutions</em> to a problem, you&rsquo;re already experimenting! You probably think of some new solutions. Once you&rsquo;ve never tried before.</p><p>As such, I recommend not holding back during that stage. When you see a problem, really allow yourself to think of <em>every</em> possible solution. No matter how stupid, or risky, or &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; it seems.</p><p>These either turn out to be the actual solution, or they <em>point</em> towards the solution.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Once I had a story that felt like it was too <em>full</em>. After some consideration, I decided it might be because there were too many characters. I wrote down the usual solutions: merge some similar characters, make the story longer to give each one more time, make some characters <em>simpler</em> and clearly bystanders to the story.</p><p>Later that day, I wrote down: &ldquo;hahaha just REMOVE them entirely from the story so the two main characters have both lost a parent and both have the same teacher&rdquo;</p><p>Yeah, you guessed it. I just had to try it. And it was the best solution. I removed the characters entirely and rewrote some later scenes to mention this fact, and the impact this loss had on the main characters. The story became way better for it.</p></div><p>It surprises me how much fear people have for being experimental or creative. Not only do people put a cage around what they can say or do, but even around the <em>ideas</em> they allow themselves to come up with.</p><p>Open this cage. Nobody needs to read your notebook (or Word documents) filled with stupid ideas. Let it all out, write it all down, don&rsquo;t filter. Notice when your brain goes into &ldquo;oh no that&rsquo;s a stupid thought&rdquo; or &ldquo;oh no can&rsquo;t think <em>that</em>!&rdquo;</p><p>Like critical thinking, most people know how to be creative, they were just told to stop doing that.</p><h2 id=when-choosing-what-to-do>When choosing what to do</h2><p>This is perhaps even more important. You need to set yourself up for experimentation.</p><p>If you always choose the same training, or the same project, you will find it hard to experiment <em>within</em> that.</p><p>So make the decision beforehand. With everything you do, add one part&mdash;on purpose&mdash;that is new and fresh and experimental.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>This is most noticeable when I write books. Because, well, each book is just a bunch of letters printed on paper, right? After a while, they all look the same&mdash;and they are. I&rsquo;ve written a few books that read similarly before learning of this experimentation principle.</p><p>Now, for each book, I search for one new thing to try. A new style of writing. A new way of thinking about characters. Do we even <em>need</em> chapters?! Hmm, maybe I can start each chapter with an image.</p><p>Just one thing is usually enough. It usually means I have to view the whole art of writing from a different angle, challenging myself. And more often than not, this new approach ends up being a <em>permanent improvement</em>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>When making music, you might add a new instrument. Or write the song in a different language. Or place your microphone elsewhere. Or write a melody with a pitch that&rsquo;s unusual for you (to sing). Or challenge yourself to write something with only 4 of the strings on the guitar.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Game development is a slightly worse example, as that is <em>such a complex and involved process</em>. Usually, you are forced to try 100 new things per project. But I do try to maintain this principle.</p><p>For example, I made a &ldquo;cutting game&rdquo;: <a href=https://pandaqi.com/unstable-universe>Unstable Universe</a>. A boardgame played with a single piece of paper, in which the main action is cutting into the paper using strict rules. The rest of the game isn&rsquo;t special&mdash;all parts were familiar to me. But I picked that one thing, that one hook, &ldquo;cutting game&rdquo;, as the experiment.</p></div><h2 id=people-will-complain-again>People will complain, again</h2><p>As expected, people will call you stupid.</p><ul><li>It will never work.</li><li>That&rsquo;s <em>too</em> out of the box.</li><li>It&rsquo;s too risky.</li><li>Your goal was to make income as a musician right? Well then I don&rsquo;t see how <em>that weird idea</em> will help with that!</li></ul><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Okay, maybe I&rsquo;ve just been surrounded by people calling me stupid my entire life. But I don&rsquo;t think this is exceptional, as I&rsquo;ve heard many artists mention receiving the exact same comments and reception as I did. In general, people cannot share your vision until you <em>execute it</em>, because it is <em>your vision</em>. Similarly, people cannot understand the skill involved in creating something, until they create it themselves.</p></div><p>And again, they might be right. But you don&rsquo;t know until you&rsquo;ve tried. And trying beats not trying.</p><p>You can only learn if you allow yourself to fail and fail hard. And that only happens if you try something new, something with which you&rsquo;re uncomfortable.</p><p>Experiment, please, experiment. It will bring the fun back into anything you do. It will get you unstuck with your learning process. It&rsquo;s the only reason you can read this guide on a computer screen: stupid experiments lead the way to innovation and progress.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/the-feedback-principle/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>The Feedback principle</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/spaced-versus-focused/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Spaced versus Focused</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
