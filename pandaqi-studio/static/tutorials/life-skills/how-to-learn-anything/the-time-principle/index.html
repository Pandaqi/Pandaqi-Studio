It doesn&rsquo;t work if you train something without <em>downtime</em>. It&rsquo;s also impossible to get deep and intuitive knowledge on anything within <em>a very short time window</em>.</p><blockquote><p>For optimal learning, do something regularly, for years, with enough breaks.</p></blockquote><p>Why? And how? Here we touch on some of the elements I mentioned in the introduction.</p><h2 id=brain-capacity>Brain capacity</h2><p>You have a limited attention span and memory. At some point, you are just <em>full</em>. You can&rsquo;t cram more in there. Studies show that students cramming just before tests learn <em>no better</em> than those who don&rsquo;t.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why you need to learn in short sprints with enough breaks.</p><p>Most of our learning happens when we <em>sleep</em>. That&rsquo;s when our brain goes into overdrive to place all its experiences from the day. Unless you can nap on command, sleeping only happens at night. Literally doing nothing and waiting a day&mdash;&ldquo;sleeping a night on it&rdquo;&mdash;will be more effective than lengthening your study session.</p><p>This also helps in some other ways.</p><h2 id=association>Association</h2><p>Our brain works through association. All day, as you get input from the environment, networks of neurons fire. You learn new things by <em>associating</em> it with earlier things you learned. This strengthens these connections.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why you get better at something over time &mldr; by not doing it.</p><p>Maybe you practiced the piano this morning. Later in the day, you hear a song on the radio. <em>Because</em> you practiced the piano, there is now a part of your brain actively looking for things to associate with it. You pick up on some of the chords in the song. You learn something new, strengthening that network.</p><p>By regularly engaging with a skill, it keeps looking for these opportunities to associate. Any other experiences in your life will <em>help</em> build that skill.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t happen if you do the thing too <em>infrequently</em>. It also can&rsquo;t happen without <em>downtime</em>.</p><h2 id=recall>Recall</h2><p>The other principle I mentioned: <em>challenge</em>. Like a muscle, only sufficient challenge will cause our brain to grow and reconnect neurons.</p><p>If you <em>just</em> studied something &mldr; recalling it is easy. If you studied something a few days ago &mldr; recalling is harder.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s what you <em>want</em>. The fact that it&rsquo;s hard to recall, means your brain works harder and learns more. Again, this can only happen if you take breaks.</p><p>Conversely, if you don&rsquo;t do something regularly enough, recall isn&rsquo;t hard&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>impossible</strong>. So learning has to start over from scratch.</p><p>I talk more about this in the chapter about <a href=../desirable-difficulty/>&ldquo;desirable difficulty&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=example-coming-back-to-a-game>Example: coming back to a game</h2><p>A fun, quick first example. There are only a few games that I have stuck with for years, such as Rocket League. (I barely play games. If you&rsquo;ve spent all day <em>developing</em> a game, you really don&rsquo;t want to play one anymore.)</p><p>This pattern repeats itself:</p><ul><li>Hey, I am getting better at this game! It&rsquo;s fun!</li><li>I play it a lot, maybe every day.</li><li>Until I stop getting better and just feel static.</li><li>I stop &mldr;</li><li>&mldr; but when I boot it again a month later, I have suddenly improved significantly</li></ul><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>In Rocket League, this usually just means there are one of two situations in which I kept missing the ball completely every time. When I come back, I don&rsquo;t anymore.</p></div><p>I&rsquo;ve read many posts from other gamers stating the same thing. Do something too often and you don&rsquo;t grow anymore. Take some time away, get some new experiences, and you will have secretly improved.</p><h2 id=example-raising-the-ceiling>Example: raising the ceiling</h2><p>With every skill I wanted to learn, I&rsquo;ve had countless moments when I thought: &ldquo;yeah, <em>now</em> I am a professional!&rdquo;</p><p>Obviously, I was wrong every time. When I thought I was done learning, or good enough to make money, there was still a long way to go. But I couldn&rsquo;t see that path until I <em>reached</em> it.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t know how bad your writing is, until you&rsquo;ve written a book. You don&rsquo;t know how terrible your character development is, until you read ten books that do it way better.</p><p>Your ceiling constantly moves up. And this takes <em>time</em>. You will not go from 0% to 100% on any skill within a few months. You&rsquo;ll <em>think</em> you can do it. Because when you&rsquo;re at 0%, you think you know what 100% is &mldr; but it&rsquo;s actually 10%.</p><p>It&rsquo;s that paradox where dumb people think they&rsquo;re super smart, yet smart people think they&rsquo;re super dumb. As you learn something, you also learn all the things you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> know yet.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t give any solid numbers, of course, like &ldquo;after 9 months and 3 days, you should be a professional!&rdquo;</p><p>I <em>have</em> listened to many creatives in my areas of expertise, and they&rsquo;re all quite close to each other. They say,</p><blockquote><p>Finish 15&ndash;20 projects with that skill, then we can talk about success</p></blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t expect to write a bestseller with your first 10 books. Don&rsquo;t expect to conquer a skill like carpentry or welding metal within your first twenty projects you attempt.</p><p>As a consequence, this takes at least a couple of years. I mean, even Brandon Sanderson doesn&rsquo;t write 10 books a year :p</p><h2 id=warning-the-temptation-to-redo>Warning: the temptation to redo</h2><p>The issue with time, of course, is that you are <em>better</em> at something once you&rsquo;ve done it. Once it&rsquo;s in the past. This means that you look back at your action or project and think &ldquo;meh, that&rsquo;s not great, let&rsquo;s redo it&rdquo;.</p><p>Writers often get stuck in &ldquo;revision hell&rdquo;, usually revising their first novel. By the end of a revision, they have grown as a writer! So they see more issues with the book and want to revise again.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t fall for this.</p><p>Use this to measure your <em>growth</em>. But accept that this action is in the past and move on to something new, with your better skill or knowledge.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I once got that feedback from a writing competition, and I liked that they included that for everyone. They said: &ldquo;even though we find all these things wrong with your book, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you must change them and rewrite the book. Instead, take them with you on the next book&rdquo;</p></div><p>In a similar vein, authors always recommend that you take <em>a few months off</em> after the first draft of a book. If you start to revise immediately, you haven&rsquo;t had <em>time</em> to reflect on that first draft. You&rsquo;re still too close to the project. You&rsquo;re not <em>that</em> much better, as a writer, than you were a few days ago. So revising is pointless at that moment in time.</p><p>I agree with this and do it as well.</p><h2 id=example-tiny-steps-each-day>Example: tiny steps each day</h2><p>This is a common example. (One I also cover in my <a href=../../productivity/>Productivity</a> course.) If you improve 1% each day, you see <em>massive</em> improvement after a year.</p><p>More than 10% jumps every few weeks, if that is even possible. Certainly more than 50% jumps, but only twice a year.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need to see the end goal. You don&rsquo;t even have to believe in yourself or see immediate progress. Trust that <em>time</em> will do its thing.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been uncertain about <em>every</em> project I ever made. Certainly novels can get to your head. (Is this even interesting? Won&rsquo;t readers just stop reading at chapter 5? And what if the climax isn&rsquo;t satisfying? Darn, this book is boring, I need to rewrite from the start.)</p><p>But I set my tiny step: at least 2,000 words a day, at most 5,000. And I do that, even if I don&rsquo;t believe in it, even if the final product (a novel ~= 80,000 words) is miles away.</p><p>Sometimes, this means writing the novel is just a byproduct. The rest of the day, I do something else, invent some other main project. Then I only write thirty minutes in the evening. But that&rsquo;s fine! Because one or two months later &mldr; you surprise yourself by writing the last sentence of that book.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This quite literally comes as a surprise to me for some books. Because I honestly forgot how far along we were, just doing my two thousand words each day, just following a vague outline until the end. And then I suddenly find myself writing the final chapters and solving the last mysteries of the book.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/the-do-principle/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>The Do principle</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/the-feedback-principle/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>The Feedback principle</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
