Both self-analysis and putting yourself in situations where feedback comes from the outside. Without this analysis, learning is random. You might do the right thing, you might not, there&rsquo;s no way to know! You make mistakes &mldr; but don&rsquo;t actually learn from them.</p><p>That&rsquo;s important enough to repeat. (Some people think merely doing stuff wrong is <em>great</em> and will continue making the same mistake until the end of time.)</p><blockquote><p>Making mistakes is crucial for any learning. But only if you <em>learn from them</em>.</p></blockquote><p>How do you analyze yourself? Where do you get feedback? I see these main components.</p><ul><li>Critical thinking (objectivity)</li><li>Asking the right questions (prompting good feedback)</li><li>Putting yourself out there (external feedback)</li><li>Design the right environment (constant testing)</li></ul><h2 id=critical-thinking>Critical thinking</h2><p>This is obviously not something I can teach in this guide. It&rsquo;s a mind-set, another skill, that unfortunately many people lack. It doesn&rsquo;t help that schools teach you <em>not</em> do to this. Any critical or individual thinking in the educational system will open the gates to hell.</p><p>Honestly, the best (and most fun) way to practice this is by <em>programming</em>.</p><p>Nothing major. No need to be scared, if you have no idea how to code. There are great websites out there where you can learn to code through simple challenges and problem solving, such as <a href=https://codewars.com>CodeWars</a></p><p>Why do I recommend this? Because coding completely removes <em>subjectivity</em> and <em>assumptions</em>.</p><p>The computer does exactly what you tell it to do. It can&rsquo;t guess what you want. It won&rsquo;t do what you want just because you ask nicely. You need to think completely logically and critically.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Especially as you get into tougher and tougher code. It&rsquo;s not hard to find the bug in code that merely adds two numbers. It&rsquo;s very hard to find the bug in code that has to find the shortest path between any two points in the world.</p></div><p>This is how I learned critical, logical, objective thinking.</p><p>Remember when I told you I got defensive and irritated when I received my first feedback as a kid? That&rsquo;s bad. You won&rsquo;t learn from it. And others will hesitate to ever give feedback again. When I looked at my own work, emotions and assumptions guided me. &ldquo;I spent so much time on this, it must be good&rdquo; or &ldquo;They just don&rsquo;t play a lot of games, they don&rsquo;t <em>get it</em>&rdquo;.</p><p>Remove all that. Analyze yourself critically. And the best way to train that, is by trying to get a dumb computer to do the simplest task imaginable.</p><h2 id=the-right-questions>The right questions</h2><p>Alright, skip forward a few years. I can now graciously accept feedback. That still didn&rsquo;t solve my problems! Because the feedback I got was something like &ldquo;yeah the game is fun&rdquo; or &ldquo;nah it&rsquo;s just hard to understand&rdquo;.</p><p>You need to ask <em>the right questions</em> if you want useful answers.</p><h3 id=self-analysis>Self-analysis</h3><p>Sure, you can start with a question like</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Why is my basketball technique so <em>bad</em>?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t this scene from my novel work?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Why do I suck at playing the guitar?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>But you need to dig deeper than that.</p><ul><li>Try to get as specific as possible</li><li>And remove value judgments; instead, phrase it as a problem to solve</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s say I throw a basketball and it doesn&rsquo;t go in. Then we have a specific <em>problem</em> that needs solving: the basketball should go in! Instead of saying &ldquo;man I suck at basketball&rdquo;, say &ldquo;how do I get the ball in there the next time?&rdquo;</p><p>And then you can focus on specific parts. Was it my stance? Am I not strong enough? Do I need to aim higher? Go through each part involved, check it, and find possible changes to make.</p><p>Another example. When I feel a scene isn&rsquo;t working in a story, I ask myself a myriad of specific questions.</p><ul><li>Is there tension? Is it enough?</li><li>Does the story not flow? Are there badly written sentences?</li><li>Are characters acting like themselves or not?</li><li>Is there an interesting hook to this scene? Is it interesting enough?</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul><p>Once I have some idea what&rsquo;s happening, I phrase the problem to solve and possible options. Perhaps: &ldquo;The scene feels incoherent, all over the place. How do we solve that?&rdquo; And possible solutions would be that too much is happening, that I contradict myself, that the scene starts one way but ends on a completely different note.</p><p>Now, remember the first principle: &ldquo;Do&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t look at all your options and start <em>worrying</em> and <em>doubting</em>. Hmm, I don&rsquo;t know which solution is the best! What to do, what to do?</p><p>Just do one of them. Try them all, if possible.</p><h3 id=external>External</h3><p>The same applies when asking others for feedback. Many game developers will test their game and then ask: &ldquo;So, did you have fun?&rdquo; or &ldquo;And what do you think?&rdquo;</p><p>The first is a closed question (only yes/no). The second is so open and broad that people wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p>Instead, I learned to ask open questions, that are still specific enough to answer.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;I notice you don&rsquo;t use button X. What&rsquo;s the reason?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;At level 3, you guys were stuck for a while. Talk me through your thought process.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work, I switch to more emotional and creative questions. These are sometimes closed, but it gets the feedback juice flowing.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;What is your absolute <em>favorite</em> part of this game?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Which part do you <em>hate</em> the most?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;If you could change one thing, what would it be?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;If I changed the rules to X or Y, would you like that or not?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Once they&rsquo;ve answered a few of these, they are ready for the real questions. (Sometimes the answers to these are just as instructive, though.)</p><p>The same is true for any other skill. When asking for feedback, don&rsquo;t just <em>show</em> something to people (or <em>send</em> them something) and wait. Actually <em>ask</em> specific questions. Actually prompt them about the things of which you are most uncertain.</p><h3 id=about-dealing-with-feedback>About dealing with feedback</h3><p>Feedback isn&rsquo;t 100% correct, both external and internal. You might think you suck at something, while others don&rsquo;t. (We are quick to find ourselves incapable of anything or the best human to ever grace the earth.) Others might tell you to stop doing something, but they are actually wrong.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I started with critical thinking. Remove emotion, assumption, relationships with the people that gave you feedback, etcetera. If you think objectively and logically, you can discern which feedback is valuable and which is not.</p><p>In general, though, the rule is,</p><ul><li>If only one or two people give a certain feedback, it&rsquo;s probably a matter of <em>taste</em>&mdash;ignore it.</li><li>If almost everyone gives the same feedback, it&rsquo;s probably a real issue&mdash;take it seriously.</li></ul><h2 id=putting-yourself-out-there>Putting yourself out there</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve already given several examples of situations where I thought &ldquo;this is bad, nobody cares&rdquo;, but put something online anyway. And what do you know? Some people cared.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a certainty. In fact, you <em>will</em> be rejected often, and you <em>will</em> do things (or make things) that nobody sees or likes. That will feel bad, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p><p>Accept that downside for the enormous upside: putting yourself out there will lead to more feedback and more chances of success.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It&rsquo;s the only way, really, if you want income or recognition for the thing you do. If, whatever you want to learn right now, is supposed to turn into a career. You might not, which is also fine.</p></div><p>If applicable &mldr;</p><ul><li>Make a portfolio or post your work online.</li><li>Join a local group or community around what you do</li><li>Audition for competitions, jobs, whatever (yourself or your work)</li></ul><p>I learned more from a few query letters to agents and some writing competitions, than writing several entire books. At the same time, this got my name out there.</p><p>This feeds back into the previous section. If you put yourself out there, you&rsquo;ll receive more external feedback, usually from unexpected angles.</p><p>They will tell you things you would&rsquo;ve never discovered yourself. Both mistakes to fix (and perhaps how to fix them), and things at which you actually already excel.</p><h2 id=design-the-environment>Design the environment</h2><p>This is why <em>games</em> are such amazing learning tools. One of the core principles of gaming is <strong>feedback (loops)</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>You constantly either succeed (<em>victory!</em>) or fail (<em>game over!</em>). Both on the macro scale (e.g. losing the whole game) and micro scale (e.g. losing one life)</p></blockquote><p>This means you <em>constantly test</em> your skill against the system. Such a short feedback loop is ideal for learning. The shorter the better. The clearer the better.</p><p>So try to design your environment to get this feedback. Find ways to easily test what you&rsquo;re doing against <em>some</em> measurement. Yes, this is basically &ldquo;gamifying&rdquo; the learning process.</p><p>Because physical sports are just games, they have this by default. You kick a soccer ball, it goes where you want or not&mdash;immediate feedback.</p><p>This is harder for other skills. That&rsquo;s why I say <em>design</em> your environment. You&rsquo;ll need to try some things, make a few changes, so the environment <em>allows</em> constant testing.</p><p>But the crucial part of this is a clearly defined <strong>goal</strong> and an easy way to <strong>check it</strong>. A clear <em>win state</em> and <em>fail state</em>.</p><p>If you can formulate a goal&mdash;the thing you want to get out of your learning session&mdash;you can test your progress.</p><ul><li>When you succeed, you analyze it as a success and save it in your brain as &ldquo;do that again!&rdquo;</li><li>When you fail, you analyze it using the techniques above and save it in your brain as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do that again!&rdquo;</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Shorter and simpler writing is usually better. It is, however, hard to get your thoughts onto paper succinctly the first time you try. You&rsquo;ll probably write sentences that are too long or use constructions that are needlessly complicated.</p><p>We can test this! There are <em>readability tests</em> that score your text. There are editors like the Hemingway Editor that spot passive voice and complicated words. Any time I finish a chapter, I quickly throw it in there. Usually, this allows me to spot ten simple things I can immediately do to improve the text.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Many programmers do this very well, even by instinct. To learn a new syntax or language, they&rsquo;ll do a &ldquo;hobby project&rdquo; that challenges the things they want to learn. It might be a game, it might be something much smaller.</p><p>But they say to themselves: &ldquo;alright, my goal is to get a rotating red rectangle on the screen&rdquo; Every time they run their code, they test if that is the case. If not, they continue trying new things. If so, yay! They will never forget how to do that.</p></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Putting it all together, how do you analyze yourself?</p><ul><li>First, define what is actually wrong or right to you. Design your habits or training to easily check this.</li><li>If you fail your test, formulate the failure as a problem to solve. List as many options as you can, then try those.</li><li>Put what you do or make out there as much as possible. Ask external feedback, and ask it in the way that gives meaningful answers.</li><li>At all times, think <em>critically</em> about yourself and the feedback. If you do this often, you get better at finding logical solutions to any problem.</li></ul><p>As mentioned, when I started doing (creative) projects, I struggled a lot with this analysis. I usually thought something was good or bad purely based on <em>mood</em> or my <em>energy levels</em>. If I thought something needed fixing, I had no clue <em>how</em> to fix it.</p><p>But by trying again and again, I developed a basic sense of, well, &ldquo;problem solving&rdquo;. I see this with everyone who has some experience within their field. You get an intuition that immediately fires all possible solutions to problems, and can even sort them based on what is the most logical (or most probable to work).</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>You can, again, see this in my devlogs on <a href=https://pandaqi.com/blog>Pandaqi Blog</a>. Some of them are just 10,000 words of &ldquo;hey, this doesn&rsquo;t work in the game => here are fifteen possible solutions I came up with, and I tried them <em>all</em>&rdquo;</p></div><p>Again, quantity breads quality. Quantity breeds intuition and experience. You will learn how to analyze and problem solve yourself just by trying to do it a lot.</p><p>This principle will be easier if you come from a more &ldquo;logical&rdquo; background (such as programming, science, etcetera).</p><p>It will probably be the toughest if you&rsquo;re not from that background. Simply because many people <em>unlearn</em> how to think logically and critically.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Ever noticed how young kids ask all the best questions? They hear something, think logically about that, then ask questions about what doesn&rsquo;t seem right to them. <em>That is the mindset.</em> Everyone can do it, we&rsquo;re just taught to stop doing it.</p></div><p>Well, <em>relearn</em> it!</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/the-time-principle/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>The Time principle</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/the-experiment-principle/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>The Experiment principle</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
