That&rsquo;s why trimming your nails is the next chapter in this guide, as you will have to trim them all your life.</p><p>Are long nails that bad? Not necessarily. But they have many disadvantages:</p><ul><li>They look bad</li><li>They can be sharp and hurt yourself or other people</li><li>They collect lots of dirt underneath them</li><li>They can seriously hinder you in doing your daily tasks. (For example, if I have long nails, I can&rsquo;t easily type or play piano, because my nails are touching the key before my finger does. Which feels bad and clunky.)</li></ul><p>In nature, we&rsquo;d automatically trim our nails. As animals run, climb, fight, etcetera, their nails will break and shorten. But we don&rsquo;t live that way anymore.</p><p>I therefore advise keeping your nails short and clean.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Let me throw an opinion out there. Many women think long nails are somehow attractive. Most men do not think so. It&rsquo;s impractical, unhealthy, and why on earth would longer nails be more attractive? A similar thing is true for people playing guitar who insist on keeping their nails long.</p></div><h2 id=how-often-should-i-trim>How often should I trim?</h2><p>Nails grow at a different rate for each person. There&rsquo;s no standard rule for when to cut them. Cut them whenever they become a nuisance or you can clearly see the white outgrowth of the nail.</p><p>On average, though, you&rsquo;ll cut them <strong>once every two week</strong>s. If you experience trouble with long nails, or they collect too much dirt, definitely cut them earlier.</p><p>Sometimes, your nails will collect lots of dirt without being long at all. (Mostly because your work means getting your hands dirty.) In that case, they need special cleaning. When taking a shower, or washing your hands, check if they are dirty.</p><h2 id=how-to-remove-that-dirt>How to remove that dirt?</h2><p>Try these steps (in this order):</p><ul><li>Wash them</li><li>Use a flat pin or tool to get underneath the nail and remove the dirt</li><li>Buy a special brush you can move over your nails, with hairs that reach underneath</li><li>Hold your hands/feet in a bowl of hot, soapy water for a longer period of time.</li><li>Keep your nails really short in general</li></ul><p>Don&rsquo;t try to clean your nails by scratching the dirt away with another one.</p><h2 id=about-biting-nails>About biting nails</h2><p>Don&rsquo;t! Just don&rsquo;t do it!</p><ul><li>It doesn&rsquo;t look good</li><li>Your nails get rough, uneven, sharp edges. (Which again, are impractical and can hurt yourself.)</li><li>It&rsquo;s not natural to bite or eat your nails.</li><li>This is usually a <em>symptom</em> of being stressed or anxious. Resolve this problem in a healthy, constructive way&mdash;instead of merely taking away the symptom.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-trim-nails>How to trim nails</h2><p>When you look at your nails, you should see two parts.</p><ul><li>A pink-ish part near the finger</li><li>A white part at the growing end.</li></ul><p>The white part is the part of the nail that sticks out. Its color is created by the oxygen it collects. The white part can be cut off <em>completely</em>, but leave the other part alone!</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve accidentally cut a nail uneven, don&rsquo;t try and try to fix your mistake. It&rsquo;s a never-ending process that will make your nails too short.</p><p>It also increases the probability of nails <strong>growing in</strong>. It means the nail grows into your skin, because it has nowhere else to go, instead of growing outward. This is painful. It often requires a doctor to solve the issue.</p><p>Instead, if needed, try to even your nails out by using a <strong>nail file</strong>.</p><h3 id=your-hands>Your Hands</h3><p>Fingernails grow faster than toenails. They are also seen more by others. (Unless you, somehow, show your feet to a lot of people.)</p><p>These, therefore, usually need more care and more trimming than your toes.</p><p>You should cut the nails <strong>round / curved</strong>. Its end follows the roundness of your fingertips.</p><h3 id=your-feet>Your Feet</h3><p>These ones grow slower, but are much stronger. People usually cut them less often, but you <em>can</em> do them at the same time as you do your hands.</p><p>The biggest difference? You must cut these <strong>straight</strong>. The end should mostly be a straight horizontal line.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/personal-hygiene/showering-and-washing/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Showering & Washing</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/personal-hygiene/teeth/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Teeth & Bad Breath</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
