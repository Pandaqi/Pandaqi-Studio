There was a time when every product tried to remove &ldquo;fat&rdquo;, because everyone thought it was <em>bad</em> and <em>terrible</em>. Then it turned out fat might actually be healthy and better than carbohydrates. So now every product tries to remove <em>that</em> because they are <em>bad</em> and <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>You get the point. We&rsquo;re still not 100% sure what different nutrients do and how much you need. And food packaging will just say <em>whatever they need to say</em> to get you to buy the product. Don&rsquo;t listen to that.</p><p>This is why I dislike a phrase like &ldquo;counting calories&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a lot of work &mldr; to get a number that means nothing. Calories aren&rsquo;t inherently bad. Our body is quite adept at changing nutrients into other nutrients, so the number will be <em>wrong</em>. And different people, with different lifestyles, need different amounts.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>As I mentioned last chapter, I&rsquo;ve exercised intensively every day of my life. I had no choice: I had to do it to combat my chronic illness. So, at least 1â€“2 hours of tough exercise each day.</p><p>But what does this mean? It means I have, consistently, eaten nearly twice the amount prescribed for a (young) man. If I&rsquo;d counted my calories, I would have dropped dead from lack of energy and nutrients a long time ago.</p></div><h2 id=variation--balance>Variation & Balance</h2><p>Instead, the magic word is <strong>variation</strong> and <strong>balance</strong>. If you change some parts of your diet every day, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you eat too little or too much. If you miss a few important nutrients on Thursday, because you will get them on Friday or Saturday.</p><p>Your intake should be balanced based on what you need. You shouldn&rsquo;t see getting fat as a mistake or penalty. It&rsquo;s a <em>sign</em> from your body that your current diet is <em>not working</em>. So change it to something else, see what happens. Keep iterating until you find the balance that works for <em>you</em>.</p><h2 id=a-remark>A remark</h2><p>I adviced to ignore claims on packaging or counting calories. But there is one thing I <em>do</em> recommend: looking at the exact contents of what you eat. Here in Europe, suppliers are required to put this on the packaging in a standard format, clear and easy to read.</p><p>This is where you actually see what&rsquo;s inside, broken down by nutrient type.</p><p>Studying this will help you remember the different nutrients and in what products they typically appear.</p><p>It will also surprise you.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>All my life, I&rsquo;d heard that dairy products were great, because they had all this <em>protein</em> and <em>calcium</em>. That&rsquo;s why I started eating a lot of yoghurt in the first place.</p><p>Then I actually looked at the contents. You know what yoghurt is also? A whole lot of carbohydrates. I thought I was being healthy, but to get my protein, I was eating almost exclusively big bowls of calories and sugar.</p></div><p>That said, let&rsquo;s go over the different types of nutrients.</p><h2 id=carbohydrates>Carbohydrates</h2><p>This is a type of sugar, but slightly different. They are an easy and consistent way to get <strong>energy</strong>. That&rsquo;s why they are the backbone of most diets around the world.</p><p><em>Bread</em> is a main source of carbohydrates. <em>Starch</em> is also filled with this. (Which is a crucial part of the diet here in the Netherlands, thanks to potatoes.)</p><p>Our body is perfectly capable of turning other nutrients into energy. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean you should completely throw out all the carbohydrates. They are more efficient energy sources and should be used as additional sources.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Humans use a <em>lot</em> of energy during the day. Thanks to our large brain and the fact we try to stay busy all day, as opposed to, say, dogs that will spend most of the day just lying down and relaxing. If you have to get all your energy from other sources, you&rsquo;d have to eat <em>a lot</em> more.</p></div><p>There&rsquo;s another reason, maybe even more important, why bread is a staple all over the world. Most carbohydrates come with <em>fiber</em> as well, which is great for your bowel system. More on that later.</p><h2 id=protein>Protein</h2><p>Building blocks for everything in your body. More protein is usually good. More diversity is also good.</p><p>Surplus will be turned into energy, or fat if not used. But our body doesn&rsquo;t like that and this conversion is very inefficient. So yes, you can eat <em>too much</em> protein, but it should not be a great concern.</p><p>In Dutch, this nutrient has the misleading name &ldquo;eiwit&rdquo;, which is literally &ldquo;eggwhite&rdquo;. This gives many the impression that you can only get this by eating eggs or dairy products. This is not true. This is where you find protein:</p><ul><li>Dairy products</li><li>Nuts</li><li>Seeds</li><li>Vegetables</li></ul><h2 id=vitamins--minerals>Vitamins & Minerals</h2><p>Crucial. Always good. A surplus of them is simply ignored by your body. (But it&rsquo;s hard to reach such a surplus!)</p><p>These are commonly found in vegetables, fruit, nuts, and seeds.</p><p>Beware! Many products hide artificial additives with something that <em>sounds like</em> a vitamine or nutrient. It is not. Those additives are very unhealthy and most of all unnecessary.</p><p>My mother has always refrained from buying anything with aritifically added flavours or chemicals. It&rsquo;s an easy way to sidestep all sorts of health issues&mdash;and I will always continue to do the same.</p><p>Vitamins and minerals come naturally with, well, natural products. By default, the more something has been processed or &ldquo;designed by humans&rdquo;, the more likely it has lost all this good content.</p><p>Some vitamines are hard to get through food, especially for vegans. Vitamine D is made by walking outside, in the sun. Vitamine B is more available in meat products.</p><h2 id=fat>Fat</h2><p>They are similar to carbohydrates. In general, though, it&rsquo;s been shown in recent years they are <em>preferable</em>. But only if you eat the right <em>type</em> of fat. (And, as always, eating more than you need remains bad.)</p><p>The good ones are <strong>unsaturated fats</strong>. The bad ones are <strong>saturated fats</strong>.</p><p>If you are very physically active, you need more carbohydrates and fat to keep up the energy, and more protein to rebuild your muscle.</p><p>If you see a product claiming &ldquo;0% fat&rdquo;, be wary. Fat isn&rsquo;t bad by default&mdash;it&rsquo;s the type and amount of fat related to other nutrients. And if they removed fat, they&rsquo;ve likely substituted it with something even worse &mldr; like sugar.</p><h2 id=sugar>Sugar</h2><p>Most people know sugar is bad for you. What people don&rsquo;t realize, is exactly <em>how</em> bad it is. Well, it&rsquo;s bad enough that one of the upcoming chapters is completely about sugar!</p><h2 id=anything-else>Anything else</h2><p>Anything else? Not a nutrient. At best, it&rsquo;s ignored by your body. At worst, it is stored or used, and builds up to a massive problem over time.</p><p>Even sugar can <em>barely</em> be called a nutrient.</p><p>Alcohol or caffeine are not nutrients. Anything artifically made or added, is not a nutrient. Because they have no <em>nutritional value</em>. They are like a sickness that your body has to deal with. Waste that goes in, and you just have to <em>hope</em> that it also goes out.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The remaining question is of course: <em>how much do I need to eat of each nutrient?</em></p><p>I&rsquo;ve explained why this is individual and shouldn&rsquo;t be set in stone. But yes, of course, there are general guidelines and truths for the human diet. Next chapter talks about that.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/eating-healthy/general-guidelines/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>General Guidelines</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/eating-healthy/sugar/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Sugar</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
