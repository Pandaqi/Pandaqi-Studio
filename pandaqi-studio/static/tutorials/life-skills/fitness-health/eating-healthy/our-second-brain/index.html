You&rsquo;ve had a stomach ache in your life, at least once. And when that happened, or when it was at its worst, you couldn&rsquo;t do <em>anything</em>, right? It was hard to sit or stand. It was hard to focus. Your whole day was ruined, even though the rest of your body was perfectly fine, because your <em>stomach</em> was hurting so much.</p><p>Our stomach has a very strong connection with our brain. It also has many neurons just like our brain, regulating what happens there. This most likely developed because &mldr;</p><ul><li>Digesting food is important, so let&rsquo;s devote a good chunk of resources to it.</li><li>The brain doesn&rsquo;t want to busy itself with that stuff. Let&rsquo;s offload it to another system that can make decisions for us.</li></ul><p>Our brain is still the boss. You need it for rational thinking, creative thinking, etcetera. But your stomach is called &ldquo;the second brain&rdquo;. Because it also does a lot of thinking and decision making, without involving <em>you</em> and <em>your first brain</em>, and it has the power to do so well.</p><p>What does this mean? A large part of feeling well, both physically and mentally, is about <strong>keeping your stomach happy</strong>. Any way you can. You should prioritize nurturing your second brain over many other health advice. Because, as I said, troubles with the tummy will subconsciously lead to troubles absolutely everywhere. You can&rsquo;t really fight that. When I have a (severe) stomach ache, I really can&rsquo;t stand or walk, and I really can&rsquo;t do complex work, no matter how hard I try.</p><p>Similarly, if your stomach isn&rsquo;t working well, the food you eat isn&rsquo;t digested properly. It might be stored inefficiently. It might not be stored at all, but immediately pass through your stomach and out of your body.</p><p>And so the main question becomes: <strong>how do you care for your second brain?</strong></p><h2 id=grain--fiber>Grain & Fiber</h2><p>I mentioned the importance of fiber, usually found in grains. This is why. Those fibers help digestion and keep your stomach happy.</p><p>This is, again, why bread is such a powerhouse food around the world. It provides energy (carbohydrates) very efficiently (just a few slices needed for your day), you can add other nutrients as topping, and it has <strong>loads of fiber</strong>.</p><p>So yes, people are correct when they say &ldquo;bread is basically a lot of sugar&rdquo;. But they aren&rsquo;t correct when they conclude that &ldquo;bread is bad and you should never eat it anymore&rdquo;.</p><p>In an earlier example, I explained a period in which I ate yoghurt as almost 80% of my diet. I didn&rsquo;t really get fat. Yoghurt is quite nutritional. But I <em>did</em> have a lot of issues with my digestion.</p><p>I had many stomach aches. I had trouble going to the toilet. (It feels weird to write this, but it&rsquo;s just such a good example.)</p><ul><li>First, I started adding muesli, cornflakes, lots of things with <em>fiber</em> to my yoghurt. This already helped a lot.</li><li>Then I started eating more bread. This helped even more.</li><li>Finally, I prefer eating a pasta for dinner now.</li></ul><p>These simple changes&mdash;adding more fiber&mdash;solved a lot of issues for me. Because of the stomach aches, I usually had to lay down for 30 minutes when I came home from school. I often felt heavy, slow, unhealthy, because my stomach just wasn&rsquo;t working right and slowing down my whole system.</p><p>Fiber keeps your stomach happy. Eat it a lot.</p><h2 id=easy-food>Easy food</h2><p>What else keeps your stomach happy? Food that&rsquo;s easy to digest!</p><p>This is why we cook. This is why we eat warm meals. Because they are warm, our body does <em>not</em> need to put in that much effort to digest them. (Similarly, eating bread from the fridge that&rsquo;s still frozen is a bad idea. It takes your body a lot of effort to digest that. Instead, immediately pull bread out of the freezer when you think you&rsquo;ll need it soon.)</p><p>This comes back to the chapter on fasting. Try to make your biggest meal of the day a <em>warm</em> meal. Otherwise, you are merely forcing your stomach to work harder. And our second brain does not like working harder than it should.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t cook <em>everything</em>. As I said before, cooking means you <em>do</em> lose some of the nutrients. After warming up a dish for two or three times, it has almost no nutritional value anymore.</p><p>Food that isn&rsquo;t solid&mdash;food that is &ldquo;light&rdquo;&mdash;also counts. But there are some caveats.</p><ul><li>Sugary foods are often very <em>light</em>. Because they do not contain any nutritional value. So, of course, your stomach is not going to feel full. But these are still a bad idea!</li><li>This explains why we have good fats and bad fats. The good fats are _un_saturated, which means they can be immediately digested. The bad fats are <em>saturated</em>, which means our body needs to break through layers of artificially added stuff to digest it. (Same is true for unrefined and refined grains.)</li><li>Do not eat too much food that is easy to <em>chew</em>. The act of chewing is very beneficial for the strength of our facial muscles and the functioning of our brain. (In a similar way, small teeth issues can affect your overall physical and mental healthy in significant ways.)</li></ul><p>Again, we come back to my yoghurt example. Yoghurt needs no chewing. Once a doctor taught me how important it is to eat &ldquo;hard&rdquo; food, and to chew properly, I also improved my overall health.</p><p>This is another simple change with huge results. Our stomach is our &ldquo;second brain&rdquo;. If you overwork your stomach, you will feel the same consequences as overworking your brain. You&rsquo;ll be sluggish, slow, less efficient, etcetera.</p><p>To prevent overworking,</p><ul><li>Eat &ldquo;easy&rdquo; food</li><li>Don&rsquo;t eat the whole day</li><li>Don&rsquo;t eat to much</li></ul><h2 id=bacteria--fermentation>Bacteria & Fermentation</h2><p>What about food that&rsquo;s less easy to eat? Well, we can <strong>make</strong> that easy to eat!</p><p>Most people know that our stomach runs on bacteria. <em>They</em> actually digest the food, they ensure it breaks down as it should and ends up where it belongs.</p><p>How do you get more bacteria? (And the right kind?)</p><p>By eating <strong>fermented</strong> products.</p><p>Dairy products are usually fermented, to different degrees. The yoghurt packaging, at least here in the Netherlands, often proudly proclaims it has some great bacteria cultures inside!</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Something I always found funny as a kid.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Alright, we have to market this milk product. Ideas?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s say it has L. Bichocioalales inside!&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Great idea! Nothing as convincing as bacteriacultures that are hard to pronounce!&rdquo;</li></ul></div><p>But I warned you about eating too much dairy. (I mean, with all those examples on yoghurt, this guide starts to read like an anti-yoghurt campaign at this point.) It is filled with carbohydrates, more than you think. Adults often can&rsquo;t digest many of the nutrients or even react badly to it.</p><p>So, the crown goes to actually fully fermented products.</p><ul><li>Sauerkraut</li><li>Pure chocolate. (Like, <em>really</em> pure.)</li><li>Kefir</li><li>Many Asian dishes, especially Japanese</li></ul><p>Research shows that building your diet around these products has significant health benefits. It&rsquo;s what led to the discovery of our stomach being our second brain in the first place. It&rsquo;s why studies repeatedly show people in Japan being more slim, healthy and living longer.</p><p>Why? Fermentation means that bacteria has been allowed to modify a food over a long period of time. In other words, what you eat is <em>full</em> of nutrients and bacteria that our stomach <em>adores</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>This will sound like a lie, but it&rsquo;s true! One day, I had severe stomach aches. My mother had bought Kefir (with a fruity taste), merely because it was new and on sale. I drank it &mldr; and for hours after that, my stomach bubbled and groaned without pause. Then my stomach ache was gone and I felt surprisingly well the next few days.</p><p>Any time I&rsquo;ve drunk Kefir since then was less spectacular. But still, this was an interesting experience. My records of what happens when I drink Kefir show that it almost always does me a lot of good.</p></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>If your stomach is unhappy, it&rsquo;s not something to be annoyed about and ignore. It&rsquo;s something to investigate.</p><p>Make the majority of your diet unrefined, easy, warm food. Don&rsquo;t eat the whole day long, as you&rsquo;re constantly triggering your stomach to start working again. Eat enough fibers and grains, they are crucial here. And look for fermented foods or dairy products with good bacteria cultures.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>These products often taste sour or weird at first. It&rsquo;s why I ignored them for a long time&mdash;and that was a mistake. Within a few days of drinking Kefir, I got used to the taste, actually liked it. And the health benefits were an even bigger plus.</p></div><p>Keeping your second brain happy, will keep your first brain and body happy. And most of it comes down to simple changes with huge effects.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/eating-healthy/fasting/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Fasting</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/eating-healthy/how-to-apply-advice/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>How to apply all this advice?</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
