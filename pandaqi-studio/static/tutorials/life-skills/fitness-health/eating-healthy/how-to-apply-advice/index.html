All the advice is nice. Buy fermented foods. Try intermittent fasting. Don&rsquo;t eat sugars.</p><p>But how? We love sugars. We love good food. We love eating. How do you apply the good habits and remove the bad habits?</p><p>Well, this is such an important concept, that I wrote a full course about it: <a href=../../../productivity/>Productivity</a>. I highly recommend reading it, all the way through. In as little time as possible, it explains exactly what I know to work, after 15 years of trying everything and recording my results.</p><p>In this chapter, I will only focus on the most important parts for <em>eating</em>, and summarize.</p><h2 id=small-habits>Small habits</h2><p>This is the crucial part. Don&rsquo;t wait for motivation or discipline. Don&rsquo;t expect things to magically change or help you.</p><p>Build <strong>habits</strong>. Build them by taking tiny steps towards the habit. Steps so small, that you can repeat them every day.</p><p>Remember my example about drinking lemonade. I didn&rsquo;t completely <em>stop</em> drinking lemonade one day. That&rsquo;s too hard. I was too addicted to the sugar, too used to the taste. Instead, I <em>slowly</em> swapped a glas of lemonade for a glass of water, every day. I did so for <em>weeks</em>, taking tiny steps, until all my glasses were <em>water</em>.</p><p>The same for yoghurt. I swapped one bowl of yoghurt for bread. After a long period, I was able to balance my diet better.</p><p>The same for fasting. My sleep schedule used to be terrible, which meant I kept eating until 12 o&rsquo;clock, then fasted until 2â€“4 PM the next day. This was a very weird eating schedule that had many downsides, as you know by now.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t tell myself &ldquo;go to bed at 10 o&rsquo;clock now and stop eating at 6!&rdquo; and do that. It&rsquo;s too hard! My body is not used to it. Maybe I can do it once, or twice, but then I&rsquo;ve lost motivation and energy.</p><p>Instead, I moved my sleep schedule, 15 minutes a day. It took <em>months</em> to move both sleep and food schedule to reasonable times. But I was able to do it, because I could maintain my habit of taking a tiny step every day.</p><p>Can&rsquo;t maintain the habit? Make the step even tinier.</p><p>Build the habit? You can grow it into something more difficult.</p><p>This is all that counts. My productivity course explains why &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; or &ldquo;punishing / rewarding&rdquo; or &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; are all myths to ignore.</p><h2 id=buying-food>Buying food</h2><p>Yes, healthy food is more expensive than junk food. This hasn&rsquo;t changed (at all) by now, so it most likely never will.</p><p>What to do? Choose food that comes in <strong>bulk</strong>. Food that, for a relatively low price, gives you a <em>lot</em> of calories and nutritional value.</p><p>There are always options. Two vegetables might be similarly prices. But one is small, and the other is large and provides <em>more</em>. Pick the food that is still healthy, but also provides a lot of bang for your back.</p><p>For example, <em>rice</em> provides a lot for little money. In fact, for most people, cooking rice means they&rsquo;ll end up with <em>waaay</em> too much and will eat rice for the rest of the week ðŸ˜‚</p><p>It&rsquo;s a very simple idea. Many people miss it.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Honestly, I could get quite frustrated about this. My mother would buy all these weird, exotic products saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to vary your diet&rdquo; and &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try this new thing!&rdquo; But the result was usually that there <em>wasn&rsquo;t enough food</em> for anyone. We spend more money&mdash;money we don&rsquo;t have&mdash;only to eat way too little. And how do you compensate that? Yes, you guessed it, by overeating on calories later. Not good.</p></div><p>If you choose your products wisely, you never have to worry about having too little food on the table.</p><p>For all the Dutch people: no, you don&rsquo;t need apple sauce with <em>everything</em>. In fact, as we&rsquo;ve learned, it&rsquo;s just sugar (only the bad bits from the apple, not the good bits). Many households spend a lot of money on this, adding it to every single dish, but it&rsquo;s unhealthy and unnecessary. If needed, try other sauces instead.</p><h2 id=what-if-i-dont-like-vegetables>What if I don&rsquo;t like vegetables?</h2><p>Join the club! I absolutely despise the taste of most vegetables. (Probably something connected to my sweet tooth.)</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the trick: you can just sneak them into other dishes. This combines with my advice above.</p><p>I highly recommend to build your <em>main</em> food source (probably warm dinner) like this:</p><ul><li>A bulk grain product as the base, like pasta or rice</li><li>Throw something you really like (we often used tiny vegetarian meat cubes) in there</li><li>Throw many small / cut vegetables in there as well</li><li>Try to get fermented foods and varied herbs in there</li><li>If needed, drench it in a sauce, like tomato sauce</li><li>While eating, grab a few (cashew) nuts and throw them in there. I like the taste of a soft pasta or rice, combined with the hard chunks of nuts and seeds. Most people really like the combination of soft and hard, easy and crunchy.</li></ul><p>This way, I can eat <em>a lot</em> of vegetables. At the same time, I <em>like</em> the taste of what I eat, because I mostly taste tomato sauce, the meat cubes, the pasta.</p><p>My favorite dish is probably <em>curry madras</em>, which does this beautifully. Rice, many vegetables, and curry all over it.</p><p>This is probably my most personal advice, but I think it&rsquo;s a crucial one. Too many people either &mldr;</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t eat healthy, because they don&rsquo;t like the taste</li><li>Are forced to repeatedly eat stuff (perhaps by their parents) that makes them gag</li></ul><p>Both situations are bad. By mixing tasty with healthy, using my plan above, you can solve all issues. You can eat something you <em>love</em>, while getting more than enough <em>vegetables and protein</em>.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>My mouth is watering just writing about curry madras xD I despise cauliflower, which is like 90% of that dish. But when combined with the rest? I love it.</p></div><h2 id=eating-the-right-way>Eating the right way</h2><p>You might think: &ldquo;erm, I think I already <em>know</em> how to eat! Been doing it my whole life!&rdquo;</p><p>True, true. But even if you know some way to (repeatedly) do something, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the best way.</p><p>It mostly has to do with the <strong>hunger / full signal</strong>.</p><p>When you get the hunger signal, you should immediately find something to eat. This is most natural to us animals: we&rsquo;re hungry, we hunt, we eat. This is why keeping a <em>schedule</em> helps: your body will be trained to send the hunger signal at the right times.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>immediately eat</em>. It means you start working towards eating food as quickly as possible, by going to the kitchen, or preparing it, or buying groceries.</p><p>What if you don&rsquo;t?</p><ul><li>The moment you see food again, you&rsquo;re inclined to overeat. You&rsquo;re so hungry, you eat too much, you eat junk food, you don&rsquo;t chew properly anymore.</li><li>As explained in the &ldquo;fasting&rdquo; chapter, your body goes into panic mode and starts storing more fat, afraid no more energy is coming in.</li></ul><p>It takes around <strong>20 minutes</strong> for your brain to get the signal that it&rsquo;s full. If you eat fast, you will always eat more than you need. Because during those 20 minutes, you will already have eaten a lot more.</p><p>On top of that, eating fast means you don&rsquo;t properly chew your food. Which makes it harder to digest. Which means our second brain is unhappy and maybe not all of it is properly absorbed by the body.</p><p>Therefore, eating healthy is also just about &mldr; eating more slowly. Chew more. Drink water in between bites. Take a short break before considering if you <em>really</em> want an extra slice. Give your body time for the &ldquo;I am full&rdquo; signal</p><p>It helps if you are mindful while eating. Be focused on your food, not on something else. Don&rsquo;t watch TV in the meantime, or a movie, or do some other distracting activity. Sure, it&rsquo;s nice to have some snacks when watching that awesome blockbuster. But make it an exception, and keep it to snacks. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t eat whole meals while being distracted by something else.</p><p>You will eat too fast, you will overeat, and you won&rsquo;t even notice at all when you&rsquo;re full, because your attention is somewhere else entirely.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully this, at least, points you in the right direction.</p><ul><li>Build small habits, that can grow bigger or more healthy over time.</li><li>Certain healthy foods are very expensive for very little nutrients. Avoid them. Go for the bulk foods, the ones with bang for your buck.</li><li>Mix vegetables and protein with things you <em>do</em> like, in one dish that tastes nice. It might take some experimentation to find the right combinations, or what you like best.</li></ul></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/eating-healthy/our-second-brain/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Our second brain</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/eating-healthy/conclusion/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Conclusion</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
