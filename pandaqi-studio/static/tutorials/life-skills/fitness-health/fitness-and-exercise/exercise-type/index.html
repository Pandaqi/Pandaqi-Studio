Here, I want to briefly discuss the three main categories of exercise: cardio, strength and coordination.</p><p>All of them are important. You have to vary your exercises anyway (remember?), and this is a great way to do it. Over a three day period, vary between the three types! This also gives your body enough time to recover and repair. Training strength 100% of the time isn&rsquo;t useful. Your muscles aren&rsquo;t ready for the next training session yet, so they perform worse, and you gain almost nothing from the training session.</p><h2 id=cardio>Cardio</h2><p>This is about stamina: lung capacity, muscle fatigue, focus.</p><p>These exercises usually &mldr;</p><ul><li>Burn many calories</li><li>Target your whole body and all your physical systems</li><li>But don&rsquo;t build muscle. (In fact, it might break them down because they&rsquo;re in the way.)</li></ul><p>Some people easily get their cardio, others struggle the most with this type.</p><p>Why? Cardio can come from simple activities, like walking or cycling. People that already do this, perhaps for school or work, will automatically get their cardio training every day.</p><p>But cardio also takes the <em>longest</em> to execute and requires the most space. You can&rsquo;t do a cardio exercise in 5 minutes. The whole point is that it tests your <em>stamina</em>, so you need to do it for at least 30+ minutes.</p><p>As such, the easiest way to make this a habit, is by making it part of your lifestyle. Find <em>some reason</em> to walk or cycle somewhere every day. Find a time at which you can take a long break and walk around your house, garden, neighbourhood, whatever. Join a sports club you like that&rsquo;s all about cardio.</p><p>If that&rsquo;s not possible, you&rsquo;ll have to buy some (relatively expensive) equipment for training cardio at home. Why isn&rsquo;t this great? Because this equipment can&rsquo;t completely simulate the real activity, it&rsquo;s hard to find motivation, and it prevents variation.</p><p>To combat this, if budget allows, buy several different machines. One for cycling, one for running, one for rowing.</p><p>Of all these, <strong>rowing</strong> actually has my preference. It is tough on the whole body: both legs and upper body. It is a great cardio exercise. It doesn&rsquo;t strees your knees and joints as much, and people can typically do it longer because they&rsquo;re sitting comfortably. Rowing machines can also be folded and aren&rsquo;t that expensive.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Almost all my doctors made me do rowing or similar exercises at one point or another. And most of the time, they were right: even though it was a bit boring, it helped a lot.</p></div><h2 id=strength>Strength</h2><p>This is about strength of <em>muscles</em>, but also <em>bones</em>.</p><p>To strengthen your bones, you just need to put your body to the test. Jump, run, fall, climb, really throw that body around it. Put pressure on it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We know people have been predominantly <strong>right-handed</strong> for a long time. Why? Because we found skeletons where the bone on the left arm was very small or even gone, while the right arm was much thicker and well-preserved. Putting more stress on a bone, using it more, actually makes it grow thicker and stronger.</p><p>This also combines with my advice to teach yourself activities with both left and right (arms or legs). To not let a bone grow too small.</p></div><p>To strengthen muscles, you&rsquo;ll need targeted exercise. It&rsquo;s amazing how a weird position, or the addition of even a tiny weight, can target one specific muscle you didn&rsquo;t know you had.</p><p>As such, there&rsquo;s no reason to make this too complicated. You don&rsquo;t need long sessions, with boring repetitions, using huge weights.</p><p>You need smart, varied exercises that challenge your body in new ways. This grows muscle strength across the board. It&rsquo;s usually more fun to do and an easier habit to maintain.</p><p>All my doctors agreed on this. An exercise is perfect for you if &mldr;</p><ul><li>You can do 10â€“15 repetitions</li><li>For three sets. (Do a set, take a short break, do another set, &mldr;)</li><li>And then your muscles fail. They just can&rsquo;t do it anymore.</li></ul><p>If you can&rsquo;t do that many, it&rsquo;s too hard. If you can do way more, it doesn&rsquo;t really challenge you. (In a sense, that&rsquo;s when weight training merely becomes cardio training.)</p><h2 id=coordination>Coordination</h2><p>This part is often overlooked. But the idea is simple: any exercise that helps you to actually <em>use</em> that stamina and strength you have. One that builds balance, coordination, reflexes, spatial awareness, how to recover from a fall, physical skills such as how to swing a tennis racket or kick a football, etcetera.</p><p>This is the fun part!</p><p>You learn this by simply playing physical games. This can be an actual sport, or just challenging yourself to do some task in a physically challenging way.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>As kids, we&rsquo;d usually play a game like that when walking somewhere. Because walking is <em>boring</em>. So you told each other: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t walk on the red tiles!&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay on that thin line on the crosswalk!&rdquo;</p><p>Stupid challenges. But actually very demanding, physically. Usually, you fell a few times, but you learned from that and acquired better coordination.</p></div><p>Why is this overlooked? Because people don&rsquo;t realize how useful it is. We are, generally, quite disconnected from our nature and our body. We think it&rsquo;s completely normal to constantly tip over glasses, or stumble, or fail to catch something. Oh, we&rsquo;re just &ldquo;clumsy&rdquo;, or whatever.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not. Good coordination will prevent mistakes or dangerous situations, while making everything else easier.</p><p>Due to exercising my whole life, I have great reflexes and awereness. These have <em>saved my life</em> on numerous occasions.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Once, I cycled behind a boy with a girl on the backside of his bike. A common sight in the Netherlands.</p><p>Suddenly, without any warning or sign, they stopped <em>completely</em>. This was a busy road. It was raining and dark. Two buses were racing past us.</p><p>I barely managed to break, turn, slide off to the side, regain my balance, and perfectly lean against a lantern. If I hadn&rsquo;t done that, either I would have ended up in front of that bus, or I would have bumped <em>them</em> into the bus.</p><p>Meanwhile, most people don&rsquo;t even know what a &ldquo;tight turn&rdquo; is or how to cycle in a straight line.</p></div><p>Yes, yes, I have cycled a lot in my life. That also increases my likelihood of being part of traffic accidents, I understand that.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/equipment/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Equipment</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/tier-i-core/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Tier I: core</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
