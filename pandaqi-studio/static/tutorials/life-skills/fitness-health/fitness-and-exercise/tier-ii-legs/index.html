Now let&rsquo;s talk about the second most important group: your legs. Legs are strong. They are real workhorses. We stand on them for hours a day, and expect them to allow this without protest.</p><p>But this also means that, if your legs are unbalanced or not strong enough, other muscles will compensate in extreme ways. If you stand too much on your left leg, for example, the right side of your body will tighten up to keep balance. If your calves aren&rsquo;t strong enough, your foot won&rsquo;t properly roll off the ground when walking. And when walking doesn&rsquo;t go smoothly, you guessed it&mdash;we start compensating elsewhere.</p><h2 id=stretching>Stretching</h2><p>Many people naturally have one shorter leg and one longer leg. By default, they&rsquo;ll prefer the longer one, as it&rsquo;s easier to stand on and it will bear more of the weight. This isn&rsquo;t a huge deal. Although it&rsquo;s always recommended to train both legs equally, and stand on both equally.</p><p>But often, discrepancies are merely the result of tension and stress in the hips and thights. Our &ldquo;stress muscle&rdquo; is located there. When we feel vulnerable or sad, we &ldquo;close down&rdquo; and remove the flexibility in these joints.</p><p>As such, I always recommend some simple leg stretching at the start of your day.</p><ul><li>Do a lunge forward. Really try to go <em>as far forward</em> as you can.</li><li>Completely lean on your forward leg, keep your back leg on the ground</li><li>Try to sink as low as you can to the ground, without your knee touching it</li><li>Keep your upper body upright.</li><li>Hold this for a longer period</li></ul><p>If one of your legs is stiff, this should stretch it. It should feel like a burning sensation. This is <em>good</em>. (Although this is risky to write online. Consult an expert when in doubt.)</p><p>Do this regularly, and you should notice your legs becoming more flexible, more open, more balanced.</p><p>This is step one. Making your legs stronger will not solve differences in height or tension, or train your body to use both of them equally. You should only strengthen your legs <em>after</em> stretching and getting the right posture.</p><h2 id=sidestep>Sidestep</h2><p>This starts as a stretching exercise.</p><ul><li>Stand up straight</li><li>Raise your knee</li><li>Rotate that same leg outward, until your knee point to your side</li><li>Then slowly place it in the ground again.</li><li>Alternate and repeat.</li></ul><p>Again, you should be able to rotate equally far with both legs. Some key points:</p><ul><li>If this is hard, engage your <em>abs</em>. It&rsquo;s likely your back is too hollow, which restricts movement.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t do this too fast. Or <em>stomp</em> on the ground at the end. Make it slow and controlled, otherwise stretching turns into <em>tearing</em>.</li></ul><p>If this goes well, you can turn it into a strength exercise.</p><ul><li>Find a circular resistance band. (So, a closed loop, not two separate ends. Although you can always tie a knot.)</li><li>Bind it around your legs, right above the knees.</li><li>Now simply <em>sidestep</em> through a space, from left to right, and back again. (So, move your leg sideways, plant foot on the ground. Now move your right leg sideways to stand right next to the left leg again.)</li></ul><p>This really targets the muscles at the <em>side</em>. The ones actually used for keeping balance and not falling to one side, but often forgotten.</p><p>But this exercise allows a bit of compensation. How can we target the side muscles on their own?</p><h2 id=side-extensions>Side extensions</h2><p>These are usually called <strong>hip abductions</strong>. Lay on the ground, on your side. Now simply raise your upper leg (not touching the ground) sideways.</p><p>This is <em>hard</em>. The muscles are not used to it. (Which is exactly why we train them!)</p><p>If this goes well, make it harder:</p><ul><li>Stand upright. (Perhaps with one foot on an unstable surface.)</li><li>Wind a resistance band around your foot and some anchor point on the ground.</li><li>Now move your foot sideways and back again.</li></ul><p>Some key notes:</p><ul><li>Try to always keep some tension on the resistance band. This makes the exercise more efficient, as there are no &ldquo;pauses&rdquo;.</li><li>Really use your <em>side</em> muscles for this. Don&rsquo;t start compensating by moving your foot more forward or backward, thus putting the load on other muscles.</li></ul><h2 id=tip-toe-exercises>Tip-toe exercises</h2><p>How weight is distributed on our feet is important.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Once I learned this, I noticed that my left foot had its weight distributed equally, but my right foot stood almost entirely on the back heel. This explained a lot of my posture problems. Simply leaning more forward, putting more weight on the front of my right foot, immediately changed things (for the better) throughout my whole body.</p></div><p>The easiest exercise is just to <strong>stand on your toes</strong>. Try to stand, as long as you can, on your toes. To make it harder, stand on one leg at a time. If you can do that, start doing other stuff (like knee raises or hip abductions) with the other leg.</p><p>Otherwise, a common exercise is the <strong>step-up</strong>.</p><ul><li>Place something in front of you with a low height, like a low bench, a raised crosswalk, anything. As long as it&rsquo;s stable enough.</li><li>Step on it with one foot, like taking the stairs.</li><li>Then step down again.</li><li>Alternate and repeat.</li></ul><p>You&rsquo;ll notice you can&rsquo;t keep your balance if your weight is not at the front. If this is easy, you can add all sorts of variations. Add extra weights. Add a knee-raise. Raise the height.</p><p>Your body is a system with many parts. If you feel the weight is only on one specific part of your feet, you can change that in two ways:</p><ul><li>Train your feet</li><li>Train other parts of your body that are compensating</li></ul><p>I always recommend both ways, simultaneously.</p><h2 id=ball-bridges>Ball bridges</h2><p>This requires a yoga ball. The idea is simple: create a bridge with the ball.</p><p>This can be done in two ways:</p><ul><li>Place your <em>head</em> on the ball, your feet on the ground. Raise your hips so your upper body is completely parallel with the ground. (For added difficulty, do knee raises.)</li><li>Place your <em>feet</em> on the ball, head on the ground. Again, raise your hips, walk the ball back (towards you), which means you end with your knees very high in the air</li></ul><p>The first method is great for training stability, leg balance and core: the &ldquo;front&rdquo; part of your body. The second method is mostly great for your calves and the &ldquo;back&rdquo; part.</p><p>Again, this will be tough at first. You will fall over once or twice. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Just try it, learn how the ball distorts your balance, and soon you can work with it.</p><p>Once you can do exercises on unstable surfaces, you&rsquo;ll notice just how much stronger and more balanced your body has become.</p><h2 id=the-obvious-activities>The obvious activities</h2><p>To generally strengthen your legs, you can do any of the obvious activities:</p><ul><li>Walking</li><li>Running</li><li>Cycling</li><li>Any sport that, you know, is not played while sitting</li><li>Anything where you have to jump</li></ul><p>In general, two sport categories exist.</p><ul><li>One contains many long runs, like football.</li><li>Others are full of tiny, short sprints, like table tennis or badminton.</li></ul><p>These train different areas in different ways. I therefore recommend you try to vary those activities.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I usually played a lot of table tennis against my father in the summer. Our table was outside, so any other season wasn&rsquo;t really playable. The first one or two days of summar, my butt muscles would hurt! Those are used when executing many bursts and short sprints. Even though I exercise all year, that other exercise contained longer periods of controlled running, which simply uses completely different muscle groups.</p></div><p>Once you think about it, you realise our legs do <em>everything</em>. Keeping them strong, balanced and stretched is therefore more important than training your upper body.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It&rsquo;s funny. I think the majority of standardized or well-known exercises are for the upper body. But it&rsquo;s actually the least important. I guess it became important because it <em>looks</em> and <em>feels</em> nice to have a muscular upper body. You can show off abs, but you can&rsquo;t really show off, you know, strong side hip muscles.</p></div><p>But now the time has come: let&rsquo;s talk about that upper body.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/tier-i-core/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Tier I: core</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/tier-iii-upper-body/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Tier III: upper body</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
