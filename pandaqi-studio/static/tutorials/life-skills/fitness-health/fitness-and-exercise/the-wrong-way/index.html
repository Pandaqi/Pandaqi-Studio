They will show you how to do an exercise, or give you a number of minutes for taking walks, and think they&rsquo;re done.</p><p>This can actually have very negative consequences. Yes, in general, exercise is better than <em>no exercise</em>. But like there is a &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to use your body, there is also a &ldquo;wrong way&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=a-personal-example-posture>A personal example: posture</h2><p>My chronic illness started with my back, which wasn&rsquo;t straight. What did I do? I started exercising more. I did some things to specifically target my back, but mostly I just &mldr; cycled, played soccer, played table tennis, and other general activities.</p><p>The result was that I didn&rsquo;t correct my back posture. I merely learned how to compensate for it, by strengthening all my other muscles. I made the problem <strong>worse</strong>. Because now my body was perfectly content with having terrible posture, because hey, we are fit and we can compensate!</p><p>To this day, I am discovering the negative consequences of this, and doing exercises to specifically undo this compensation.</p><h2 id=another-personal-example-too-much-weight>Another personal example: too much weight</h2><p>A few years later, people at my medical rehabilitation tell me to do pull-ups. (You know, bar high in the air, grab it with your hands, pull your body weight upwards.)</p><p>And they were right! The pull-up is incredibly <em>hard</em>. But once you can do it, your back muscles must be extremely strong.</p><p>But you guessed it: it was so hard, that I subconsciously compensated. When I filmed myself, after <em>years</em> of doing pull-ups, I noticed I</p><ul><li>Twisted and raised my right shoulder a lot</li><li>Pulled much more with my left than my right</li><li>At the bottom of the pull-up, I allowed myself to &ldquo;hang&rdquo; in my arms, which makes the exercise both easier and more dangerous.</li></ul><p>Yes, my back was generally much stronger than before. But I also made the problem <strong>worse</strong>. Because one part of my body was much stronger than the other. And to compensate, my right shoulder started tightening and stiffening.</p><h2 id=what-do-we-learn-from-this>What do we learn from this?</h2><p>Exercise is amazing, but only if you do it <em>well</em>. Because exercise is nothing more than training. Training muscle memory, trainnig default posture, training physical actions.</p><p>And as you can teach yourself the right thing, you can also teach yourself bad habits that takes years to unlearn.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It&rsquo;s like singing. Most vocal teachers state that the problem isn&rsquo;t <em>teaching people to sing</em>. It&rsquo;s <em>teaching people to unlearn years of bad habits when using their voice</em>.</p></div><p>This is how these problems usually manifest:</p><ul><li>Your posture is bad in general. This means you use the wrong muscles in any given exercise.</li><li>You do exercises with too much weight. To be able to do them anyway, you compensate elsewhere. (Usually through posture.)</li><li>You ask too much of yourself or exercise when you are already tired. As muscles fail, others will compensate. You become less coordinated, risking injuries.</li><li>You repeat the exact same activity or exercises for the same body part. Instead, go for variety and target your whole body</li><li>You only do exercise in short bursts, like two <em>heavy</em> fitness sessions a week, and are completely passive the rest of the time. Instead, stay somewhat active at all times.</li></ul><p>As you see, <strong>compensation</strong> is the magic word here. When one muscle can&rsquo;t do it, we have a lot of other muscles that can do it. The only problem? They do it <em>worse</em> and they aren&rsquo;t <em>meant</em> for it.</p><p>These issues usually result in a muscle that is <em>tight</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t allow much movement, it&rsquo;s always stressed, it&rsquo;s bunched up. Because when a muscle lacks the strength to do something, it will simply forbid you to do that thing.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>When I finally went to a doctor, after years of back pain and issues, I said: &ldquo;my shoulders, they just won&rsquo;t work. They can&rsquo;t coordinate, they lack any strength, I can&rsquo;t use them.&rdquo;</p><p>After a short inspection, the doctor said: &ldquo;Yes, you can use your shoulders, you&rsquo;re just <em>not using them enough</em>&rdquo; Because of my back issue, I subconsciously stopped using my shoulders over time. Which obviously leads to those muscles being weak and stiff. Often, the best way to avoid issues is to merely check if you are still using all parts of your body correctly.</p></div><p>I can give endless examples, both from my own life and from doctors to whom I spoke. But that would make this chapter far too long. So I&rsquo;ll end with two last examples and hope you understand the gist of it. As you read this guide, as you exercise, prioritize <strong>exercising correctly</strong> over <strong>exercising a lot / heavily</strong>. I hope all these horror stories from my own life are enough to convince you.</p><h2 id=example-no-balance>Example: no balance</h2><p>For years, I exercised in our own backyard. I&rsquo;d run around with a football, for 30-60 minutes, until I was completely exhausted. This did many <em>good</em> things for me.</p><p>But I compensated. Because of my not-so-straight back, my balance was off. My right foot was considerably higher than my left.</p><p>The result? I &ldquo;stood&rdquo; on my left leg. I leaned left all the time. To still keep my balance, I tightened my right shoulder. I basically tucked in the right side of my body, so I wouldn&rsquo;t fall over.</p><p>Terrible, of course. Once I realized, I had to</p><ul><li>Do exercises each day to untighten that shoulder</li><li>Do difficult, painful exercises to strengten my core (abs and hips) so I would actually stand on both legs</li><li>Fight against this habit <em>every time</em> I played a sport</li></ul><p>Because this habit formed over <em>years</em>, it also took <em>years</em> to slowly dismantle it. Once you see it, it&rsquo;s obvious and stupid. You notice your whole body is leaning one side, you notice your balance is terrible, you notice your right shoulder is always stressed out of its mind. But until then? You won&rsquo;t notice just how wrong you are doing things.</p><p>Our body has wonderous ways of compensating. It will always do <em>whatever is necessary</em> to keep going and to stay inside its comfort zone as much as possible.</p><h2 id=example-push-ups>Example: push-ups</h2><p>Many people think they can do push-ups. Many gym teachers, at high school, do nothing to correct that. (Unfortunately.)</p><p>We place our elbows wide, fall down, then get up.</p><p>I did this for a few years. And again, it was better than <em>no exercise</em>. But I ended up with ridiculously strong neck muscles, and not any muscle elsewhere.</p><p>The right way to do push-ups:</p><ul><li>Means placing your elbows at your side</li><li>Leaning forwards</li><li>Engaging your abs so that you are completely straight, from start to finish</li></ul><p>This is <em>much, much harder to do</em>. It&rsquo;s the only way to prevent compensation and to actually target the right muscles.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-life-skills secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/introduction/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Introduction</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/lifestyle/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Lifestyle</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
