They will show you how to do an exercise, or give you a number of minutes for taking walks, and think they&amp;rsquo;re done.</description></item><item><title>Lifestyle</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/lifestyle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/lifestyle/</guid><description>A logical consequence of last chapter is the following idea. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to exercise in short bursts, in which you stress your body a lot, and then continue being passive the rest of your day.</description></item><item><title>Posture</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/posture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/life-skills/fitness-health/fitness-and-exercise/posture/</guid><description>All physical improvement should start with posture.

Here in the Netherlands, there are several &amp;ldquo;exercise guidelines&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;beweegrichtlijnen&amp;rdquo;).
