Otherwise you don&amp;rsquo;t know what we&amp;rsquo;re working towards! Broadly speaking, typography is a design process in three stages:</description></item><item><title>Terminology</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/typography/terminology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/typography/terminology/</guid><description>This article teaches the basic terminology used to describe typographical concepts. It&amp;rsquo;s maybe not the most flashy part of any skill, but there&amp;rsquo;s no better place for it than the start.</description></item><item><title>Typeface Classification</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/typography/typeface-classification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/typography/typeface-classification/</guid><description>So soon in the course, we&amp;rsquo;ve already hit a sensitive subject!

But not everything works equally well. People are accustomed to a certain standard page layout and reading direction, and if you want long pieces of text to be easily read, it&amp;rsquo;s best to follow those guidelines.</description></item><item><title>Design Elements</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/typography/design-elements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/typography/design-elements/</guid><description>This course has mainly talked about text blocks.
