That&rsquo;s why you can easily type all sorts of crazy symbols (<code>[]</code>, <code>\/</code>, <code>~</code>) &mldr; but have a much harder time finding typographic symbols.</p><p>Additionally, good practices concerning punctuation and special characters aren&rsquo;t really taught in school. This chapter will, therefore, be a bit more generic. The information here is applicable to all branches or activities involving writing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to remember, though, that special characters serve mostly as necessary <strong>notation</strong>. They should never reduce legibility or functionality. They should <em>increase</em> the precision of communication. Remove unnecessary punctuation whenever you can. Only use special characters to increase aesthetics if it doesn&rsquo;t compromise the clarity of the text.</p><h2 id=where-do-i-find-these-symbols>Where do I find these symbols?</h2><p>Text editing software <em>should</em> have a window or option symbol that&rsquo;s called <strong>glyphs</strong> or <strong>symbols</strong> or <strong>special characters</strong>.</p><p>It will give a complete table of <em>all special characters</em> your currently selected font has. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how much is inside a font. You can search it visually, or search by name/category.</p><p>Some software also autocorrects these. For example, if I type any hyphen in Word, a space, and then a word, it automatically makes it a dash. So let&rsquo;s start with those characters &mldr;</p><h2 id=hyphens-and-dashes>Hyphens and Dashes</h2><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of using a hyphen, en dash and em dash.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=TypographyCharactersDashes.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of using a hyphen, en dash and em dash." title="Example of using a hyphen, en dash and em dash." width=1158 height=277></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Update! I don&rsquo;t agree with this image anymore. Don&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;en dash&rdquo; in space. Only use it for ranges of numbers. Use a close-set em dash instead.</p></div><p>There are three flavours:</p><ul><li><em>Hyphens</em>: shortest (-)</li><li><em>En dashes</em>: width of the letter <em>n</em> (–)</li><li><em>Em dashes</em>: width of the letter <em>m</em> (&mdash;)</li></ul><p>These can be <strong>close-set</strong> (pushed againt the words) or <strong>in space</strong> (with a space between them and surrounding symbols).</p><p>What is the difference?</p><ul><li><em>Hyphens</em>: close-set if used to create a compound word (like &ldquo;close-set&rdquo;). Or when a word is broken up at the end of a sentence. Never in space.</li><li><em>En dashes</em>: close-set to indicate a range of numbers, never in space.</li><li><em>Em dashes</em>: close-set as a replacement of a comma (to introduce remarks or subclauses to a sentence), in space to introduce alternate speakers or quotes in a story.</li></ul><p>In general, the <em>minus</em> in mathematical notation is &mldr;</p><ul><li>A small variant (like the hyphen) to indicate negative numbers</li><li>A wide variant (like the em dash) for the subtraction operator.</li></ul><p>If possible, find a font that has special symbols built-in for mathematical operations.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Type Error:</strong> Don&rsquo;t use multiple hyphens after each other to simulate dashes.</p></blockquote><h2 id=quotes>Quotes</h2><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of different quote types (straight/curly; single/double)</span></figcaption><picture><img src=TypographyCharactersQuotes.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of different quote types (straight/curly; single/double)" title="Example of different quote types (straight/curly; single/double)" width=1158 height=183></picture></figure></p><p>Quotes can change in two ways:</p><ul><li>Straight or curly</li><li>Single or double</li></ul><p>When to use which?</p><ul><li>Use a single straight quote for <em>foot</em> (the measurement) and double straight quote for <em>inch</em>.</li><li>Use opening and closing curly quotes for all other cases. When used as an apostrophe, make sure the quote points downward.</li><li>With numerical plurals, omit the apostrophe</li></ul><p><em>Why open and close?</em> This communicates more information. And design (and type) is all about communication, right? By using a matching pair, the reader is never left in doubt when a quote starts and ends.</p><p>I prefer double quotes in all cases. Single quotes are very easy to miss, especially on screens. At the same time, this means double quotes &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; the flow of text more, which might not be what you want.</p><p>Some fonts don&rsquo;t have the curly variant. If I know I need quotes (which is 99% of the projects), I disregard those fonts.</p><h2 id=parentheses-brackets--braces>Parentheses, Brackets & Braces</h2><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of parentheses, brackets and braces in text.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=TypographyCharactersParentheses.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of parentheses, brackets and braces in text." title="Example of parentheses, brackets and braces in text." width=1158 height=249></picture></figure></p><p>Many fonts bodge these characters. They are either thick, too thin, or too symmetrical. Try to use the best version of these characters you can find.</p><p>Additionally, the spacing isn&rsquo;t always satisfying. There shouldn&rsquo;t be too much space between the letters and the parentheses, nor too little. The reader shouldn&rsquo;t stop when they see a parenthesis and think, for a second, that the sentence has ended because there&rsquo;s so much space.</p><p>If the text within parentheses is italic (or otherwise styled), keep the parentheses themselves upright and normal. That is, unless this causes letters to collide with the parentheses.</p><p>As for their usage, parentheses are the most common. They indicate a comment or something that is somewhat important, but can be left out.</p><p>Brackets and braces are mostly for programming or scientific pieces. But what&rsquo;s the reason for that? It&rsquo;s because they are great for &ldquo;grouping&rdquo; pieces of text. You can also use them like that in your designs! Place brackets or braces <em>around</em> things to give them their own place in the hierarchy.</p><h2 id=diacritics--symbols>Diacritics & Symbols</h2><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Examples of fake and real diacritics.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=TypographyCharactersDiacritics.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Examples of fake and real diacritics." title="Examples of fake and real diacritics." width=1158 height=249></picture></figure></p><p>Diacritics, just as fake bolds, can be simulated by computers. As expected, choose a font with naturally supported diacritics instead.</p><p>English doesn&rsquo;t really use these. But almost all other languages <em>do</em>. If there is <em>any</em> chance your text might not stay English 100% of the time, pick a font that supports diacritics. You don&rsquo;t want give your text an awkward, different meaning.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>For example, <em>papa</em> is father in Spanish, while <em>papá</em> is a potato.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My native language is Dutch. At least 50% of computer issues, by me and those around me, stem from the fact that their devices were setup to use an English keyboard by default &mldr; which means you can barely type anything in Dutch.</p></div><p>In a sense, you can do the <strong>poor font design test</strong>! When checking out a font, these characters are usually missing or poorly designed (in terms of visuals or spacing):</p><ul><li>Parentheses</li><li>Brackets</li><li>Asterisk</li><li>Pilcrow (paragraph mark)</li><li>Section sign</li><li>Octothorp (hashtag; #)</li></ul><h2 id=ending-sentences>Ending Sentences</h2><p>Ending sentences with a regular dot will suffice most of the time. You can explore, however, rewriting a sentence to become a question. Why? This makes it shorter and more active. (See what I did there? 😉)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I will now try to explain why you shouldn&rsquo;t do A but B&rdquo;</p><p>can be rewritten to</p><p>&ldquo;Why should you do B instead of A?&rdquo;</p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Type Error:</strong> Never, ever, use multiple exclamation or question marks after each other. In fact, avoid using exclamation marks if you can. They are like bold font styles: great when used right, otherwise too attention-grabbing and in-your-face for their own good.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Type Error:</strong> Never use two spaces after a period. It&rsquo;s unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the text. I don&rsquo;t know why this is a thing. Same with adding space before or after a question mark.</p></blockquote><p>Another common problem is: *should punctuation (like a dot) come before or after quotes?"</p><p>The answer is: before &mldr; most of the time. If it&rsquo;s a whole sentence or phrase, keep punctuation within. Otherwise, follow regular rules.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He is a thief,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not to be trusted.&rdquo;</p><p>Notice the comma <em>before</em> the quote.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Yeah, they promised they would &ldquo;look into the issue&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Follow this rule (most of the time). => (Follow this rule most of the time.)</p><p>I try to write full sentences within parentheses, instead of using them partially in a sentence.
