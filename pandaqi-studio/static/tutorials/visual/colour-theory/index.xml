Whatever you make, it is going to have a colour. Websites, newspapers, magazines, movies&amp;mdash;they are all in their most primitive form a collection of colours.</description></item><item><title>Formats &amp; Definitions</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/formats-and-definitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/formats-and-definitions/</guid><description>What actually is colour? I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to start a philosophical rambling here. But stop and think about it for a minute.</description></item><item><title>RGB, CMYK &amp; Pantone</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/rgb-cmyk-pantone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/rgb-cmyk-pantone/</guid><description>The three words from the title represent the three main colour systems in the world. Any software you work in, any ink you bought or dye you used when painting, uses one of these systems.</description></item><item><title>Using the Colour Wheel</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/using-the-colour-wheel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/using-the-colour-wheel/</guid><description>I present to you: the most overused graphic for teaching colour theory! Understanding the basic concepts is great. But realize that almost none of the designs you see in real-life adhere to the colour wheel &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; perfectly.</description></item><item><title>Using the Colour Triangle</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/using-the-colour-triangle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/using-the-colour-triangle/</guid><description>Individual colours are said to be three-dimensional. When you take a colour, like red, you can modify it in three different directions&amp;mdash;to get bright red, dark red, soft red, red-pink, etcetera.</description></item><item><title>Harmonies &amp; Relationships</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/harmonies-and-relationships/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/harmonies-and-relationships/</guid><description>Finally, finally, you have all these principles under your belt that make harmonizing possible. In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;ll combine colors to get colour schemes.</description></item><item><title>Context</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/context/</guid><description>Colour is highly contextual.

Not based on logic, or randomness, or theory.</description></item><item><title>Usage within design</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/usage-within-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/usage-within-design/</guid><description>This course has mentioned nearly everything that has to do with pure colour theory. As I said at the start: it&amp;rsquo;s meant as a supplementary course.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/conclusion/</guid><description>Well done! You&amp;rsquo;ve learned all about colour theory. Another tool to add to your toolkit, now that you understand how colour works and why, and the main mistakes you need to avoid.</description></item></channel></rss>
