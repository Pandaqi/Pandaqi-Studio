Any software you work in, any ink you bought or dye you used when painting, uses one of these systems. There&rsquo;s no good or bad here. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>So let&rsquo;s see what they are and when it&rsquo;s best to use them.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Comparing the three main colour systems</span></figcaption><picture><img src=RGBvsCMYKvsPANTONE.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Comparing the three main colour systems" title="Comparing the three main colour systems" width=1563 height=625></picture></figure></p><h2 id=rgb>RGB</h2><p>As seen earlier, the letters represent <strong>red, green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong>. These are, strictly speaking, the only colours our eyes can see. It&rsquo;s only logical that people based a system on this. This colour system is used for websites and many media formats intended for that purpose.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Such as <code>.png</code>, which means Portable Network Graphics. There is <em>no</em> way to embed information from another colour system inside a png image.</p><p>I once tried creating a simple website for converting PDFs and Layout Documents to grayscale, CMYK, etcetera. Until I realized many of my goals were just <em>impossible</em>. Because most of the online world only supports the RGB model.</p></div><p>Colours are easy to create using this system. Red, green and blue are well-known colors. Mixing those gets you yellow, turqoise and pink/purple. All quite intuitive for most people.</p><p>This system is <strong>additive</strong>. Combining all colors (red, green and blue on top of each other) creates <strong>pure white</strong>.</p><p>It is therefore a system based on light. Multiple colours on top of each other create lighter and lighter versions. You can only get <em>brighter</em> by adding more colour!</p><p>This makes it ideal for computer <strong>screens</strong>. They start as <em>black</em>. Each pixel in your screen has three lights: red, green and blue. When multiple are on simultaneously, they create the illusion of a mixed color. And when all lights inside a pixel are on? Yes, that pixel is completely white.</p><h2 id=cmyk>CMYK</h2><p>The letters stand for <strong>cyan, magenta, yellow</strong> and <strong>black</strong>. Most software allows switching between RGB and CMYK.</p><p>CMYK is slightly harder to use (for you and your computer), but it&rsquo;s what <em>physical</em> media (such as printers) understand better. And it adds some other possibilities.</p><p>The system is <strong>subtractive</strong>. Combining all colors (cyan, magenta and yellow on top of each other) creates a solid <strong>black</strong>.</p><p>It is therefore a system based on ink. You start with a blank, white, light paper. And adding colours makes it darker and darker. You can only go <em>darker</em> with this system!</p><p>This makes it ideal for any <strong>printed media</strong>. They start with a white paper and put their content on top of that.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the issues this system adds. There are two ways to create black (or shades of grey):</p><ul><li>Combining all the colors: cyan + magenta + yellow</li><li>Using only the black value.</li></ul><p>But these two will lead to a <em>different</em> black! The first one is much <em>darker</em>. Because, remember, we can only get darker. So mixing all colours will be really dark. This is a <strong>deep black</strong>.</p><p>The other is called <strong>pure black</strong> and looks more like dark grey when printed.</p><p>I have self-published several books now. Greyscale pages are much cheaper than colour pages, obviously. So I used CMYK to control my black tones. Because when I used RGB, it would convert the black into a <em>deep</em> black, and add all those colors to it. Which made my book suddenly twice as expensive!</p><p><em>What does it matter which system you pick? Can&rsquo;t both create all colours?</em> Yes, they can. CMYK can still create the same set colours as RGB. But you only need to print a RGB document once, and see that the output looks <em>nothing</em> like it did on your screen, to know the value of CMYK.</p><p>CMYK is simply a model of the way physical ink creates colour. RGB is how digital colours are created. Use the right tool and you will get consistent and intuitive end results.</p><h2 id=pantone>Pantone</h2><p>The Pantone system is actually a system for naming colours for international and interdisciplinary use. They have indexed colours and given them names in the form of <strong>PMS</strong> .</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t index all those 10 million colours, obviously, but rather a subset of 400 colours that look good within any design and across different media types.</p><p>The colours are therefore less <em>pure</em>, but more <em>soft</em>, or a blend of different colours. You won&rsquo;t find a pure 100% red here, because it doesn&rsquo;t look great on its own, and surely not with other colours.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s the reason they are loved by lots of designers. Because they allow you to create a very colourful composition without any colours clashing or the whole project becoming way too cluttered.</p><p>While you can do the same without the system, it is recommended you take a look at it. You&rsquo;ll be able to find beautiful colours you can match and use for your design.</p><h2 id=are-black-and-white-colours>Are Black and White Colours?</h2><p>Knowing about these systems, we can try to answer this question.</p><p>In RGB, white is created by adding red, green and blue together. So it&rsquo;s made out of colour, which means <em>yes</em> it is a colour. In print, white is created by not putting any colour on a white page, so <em>no</em> it is the absence of colour.</p><p>In CMYK, black is created by adding cyan, magenta and yellow together. So it&rsquo;s made out of colour, which means <em>yes</em> it is a colour. In the real world, objects are black because they absorb all light and don&rsquo;t send out any light waves, so <em>no</em> black is the absence of colour.</p><p>Most importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Pure black or pure white is <em>rare</em>. Shades of grey are, on the other hand, absolutely everywhere. They are an equally important part of your colour scheme. Once we look at colour more in-depth, you&rsquo;ll see just how much shades of grey influence everything.</p><h2 id=colour-usage-in-different-media>Colour Usage in Different Media</h2><p>As explained, the reason for these different systems is the existence of different media: paper, canvas, computer screens, and more.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Screens optically mix flecks of different light together when viewed from a distance. If you get <em>really close</em> to your screen, you might be able to see the individual lights. They stop blending together.</p><p>On the other hand, ink is transparent and mixing occurs as colours show <em>through</em> each other. If you get really close to a piece of paper, it&rsquo;s not like the ink suddenly separates into different pure colours.</p></div><p>The way they create and display a colour is different, which can lead to inconsistencies across platforms. But you can soften the issue by also changing your <em>setup</em>.</p><p>In the previous chapter I explained different formats used to define a colour. These are used to tell the computer which one you want, or to define/explain what colorscheme you choose for a project.</p><p>I made it look as though they could all display the exact same colours, but that&rsquo;s not really true.</p><p>All of them can display the same <em>number</em> of colours, but the <em>range</em> of colours (which specific ones they can actually create) is different. This range is what we call a <strong>colour space</strong> or spectrum.</p><p>They exist for two reasons:</p><ul><li>A natural byproduct of how colors are defined. (Defining them through RGB or HSL simply leads to different colours that are possible.)</li><li>Again, medium and intention. A huge, glossy billboard you want to display in the city &mldr; will likely require a very different range of colours than a small muted book cover. Or, a cheap screen might only be able do display a small range of colours. They compensate by stretching this colour space.</li></ul><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Examples of colour spaces / gamuts.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=ColourTheoryGamuts.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Examples of colour spaces / gamuts." title="Examples of colour spaces / gamuts." width=1053 height=482></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Of course, there are many more colour spaces than these, but the ones I mentioned are the most common ones.</p></div><p>We can use something called <strong>metamerism</strong> to solve all these problems. It&rsquo;s another fun property of light: the <em>appearance</em> of colour changes based on its surroundings. So even though two colours might be the same, colours around it might make them seem different.</p><p>What we need, is a way to transform one colour space into another, using this property.</p><p>Introduce the <strong>gamut</strong>. These give us a way to translate between colour systems.</p><p>On the computer, they are described within <strong>ICC profiles</strong>. Any graphical software should allow you to use them. Such a profile holds the range of colours within a colour space, its darkest and lightest tones, and how those colours are distributed (the distance between pairs of subsequent colours).</p><p>I won&rsquo;t go into detail about how to use them, as it depends heavily on your software and project. I merely wanted to tell you they exist and why. If something doesn&rsquo;t look right when you print it, maybe you set the wrong ICC profile. If you feel like you can&rsquo;t get enough contrast in your colors, maybe your colour space is too limiting.</p><p>Most of the time, however, it&rsquo;s recommended to do your work in as large a space as possible. The step to transform the color space is only taken when outputting and testing the final design.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-visual secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-visual secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/formats-and-definitions/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Formats & Definitions</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/colour-theory/using-the-colour-wheel/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Using the Colour Wheel</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
