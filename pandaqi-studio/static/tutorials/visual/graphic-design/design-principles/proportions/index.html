This could be the length of a line compared to the length of another line, or the scale of a square compared to another square, or the height of a circle compared to the height of a square.</p><p>As you see, proportional relationships exist within an element itself, but mostly between all elements on the page. Every element automatically has a certain proportional relationship with all other elements in the design. Whether you like it or not, this happens automatically, because all elements have <em>some</em> size.</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, this means you need to <em>take control</em> and make conscious designs about your proportions!</p><p>Using a proportional scale helps choose the right size of any element within the design. It also helps balance designs, as you can back up your ideas with numbers that are balanced.</p><p>Proportions are therefore usually expressed in a mathematical sense: as a ratio between the lengths or sizes of elements. If we say the proportion between two lines is <code>1:2</code>, we mean the first line is exactly half as long as the latter. (And the other way around, <code>2:1</code>, the first line is exactly twice as long as the latter).</p><p>This chapter discusses the most well-known proportions. And why they are visually pleasing, or help your design some other way.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Overview of proportions in design.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DesignProportionsOverview.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Overview of proportions in design." title="Overview of proportions in design." width=1512 height=394></picture></figure></p><h2 id=the-golden-ratio>The Golden Ratio</h2><p>Most people have heard of this ratio, as if it were some magical thing you should always adhere too. Yes, the Golden Ratio <em>is</em> a beautiful proportion! It can be found all over classical art and nature.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s not the best ratio for every design. It&rsquo;s a great place to start. But if it doesn&rsquo;t fit, just try something else.</p><p>So, what is this Golden Ratio? It&rsquo;s the ratio between two segments such that the <em>ratio between the smaller segment and the larger one</em> is the same ratio as <em>between the the larger segment and the sum of both</em>.</p><p>In mathematical terms that becomes a proportion of <strong>1:1.618</strong>.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Proportions using the golden ratio.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DesignProportionsGoldenRatio.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Proportions using the golden ratio." title="Proportions using the golden ratio." width=1512 height=394></picture></figure></p><p>The golden ratio pops up everywhere in nature. Not only in the length of lines, but also the size of curves, number of leafs, seed patterns in the center of sunflowers, and so on. That&rsquo;s why we often perceive it as natural and comfortable.</p><p>Additionally, we feel it&rsquo;s balanced. It&rsquo;s literally defined by the fact that it preserves ratio between two differently sized elements! (Smaller to larger is same as larger to sum of both.)</p><h2 id=the-root-2-proportion>The Root 2 Proportion</h2><p>We all know a square has two sides of equal length. When you draw a diagonal line through such a square, the line length has proportion root 2. (You can find this by applying Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem.)</p><p>In mathematical terms, the proportion is <strong>1:1.414</strong>.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Proportions using Root 2</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DesignProportionsRoot2.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Proportions using Root 2" title="Proportions using Root 2" width=1512 height=394></picture></figure></p><p>What&rsquo;s special? Well, this means the ratio is maintained when the elements are divided in half. Forever.</p><p>Again, this means more balance in your design, as smaller and bigger elements will keep exactly the same ratio. Not surprisingly, this proportion is used for standard paper sizes (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, &mldr;)</p><h2 id=the-23-proportion>The 2:3 Proportion</h2><p>The <code>2:3</code> proportion is a result of the human fascination with things that come in threes. Similar to the <em>rule of three</em> in writing, it suggests anything that comes in triples is more visually pleasing.</p><p>In mathematical terms, the proportion is <strong>1:1.667</strong>.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Proportions using 2:3.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DesignProportionsTwoThirds.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Proportions using 2:3." title="Proportions using 2:3." width=1512 height=394></picture></figure></p><p>What&rsquo;s special? Anytime you have three of something and divide/scale it, the proportion stays 2:3. For example, if you have 3 cubes and want to divide them, all you can create is <em>one group of 1 element</em> and <em>one group of 2 elements</em>. Hence, 2:3.</p><p>As long as you rigorously stick to this proportion, this property makes it balanced as well.</p><h2 id=the-34-proportion>The 3:4 Proportion</h2><p>Lastly, the <code>3:4</code> proportion is a more workable alternative to the 2:3. It still uses that magical number three, but combines it with the four, which allows things to be easily put into squares and grids.</p><p>In mathematical terms, the proportion is <strong>1:1.334</strong>.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Proportions using 3:4.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DesignProportionsThreeFourth.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Proportions using 3:4." title="Proportions using 3:4." width=1512 height=395></picture></figure></p><p>What&rsquo;s special? It&rsquo;s easily divisible into multiple combinations, making it flexible to work with when constructing grids. Otherwise, this proportion is less balanced and seems less visually appealing than the others.</p><h2 id=how-to-apply-proportions>How to Apply Proportions</h2><p>There is no single best proportion. Pick the proportional scale you think is best for your specific design.</p><p>You also don&rsquo;t have to follow the scale exactly. By skipping multiple steps, you create a <strong>varied scale</strong>, which adds to the contrast and dynamics of your design.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Creating proportions using a varied scale.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DesignProportionsVariedScale.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Creating proportions using a varied scale." title="Creating proportions using a varied scale." width=1512 height=412></picture></figure></p><p>Applying proportions is a simple matter of performing these quick calculations, every time. When you place a new element on the page &mldr;</p><ul><li>Check with the size of another element (that should follow the same scale)</li><li>Multiply or divide it by the ratio of your proportional scale.</li><li>And you have your final size!</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Say you were using the golden ratio for your typography. Your biggest headline is 62pt, and you&rsquo;re satisfied with that.</p><p>Then, your second biggest headline could be 62 / 1.618 = 38pt big.</p><p>Furthermore, your body text could be 62 / 1.618 / 1.618 / 1.618 = 14pt big.</p><p>It&rsquo;s fast and simple, but it should provide you with a balanced and good-looking design.</p></div><h2 id=dont-forget-the-outside>Don&rsquo;t forget the outside</h2><p>Don&rsquo;t forget the outer dimensions of the medium you use! If your design is meant for an A4 paper, you&rsquo;ll already have the proportions of that paper you need to take into account.</p><p>It&rsquo;s often best to work with the proportions your medium gives you, instead of working against them. The other way around, if you have an amazing design but don&rsquo;t know what paper size to use, let the proportions decide!</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-visual secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-visual secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/balance/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Balance</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/space/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Space</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
