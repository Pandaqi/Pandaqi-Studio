It is the last section (out of three) for the course on Graphic Design.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchy</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/hierarchy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/hierarchy/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the fundamental visual elements and their properties. Let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the bigger picture: placing all the elements together within the same design&amp;mdash;without turning it into complete chaos.</description></item><item><title>Grouping</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/grouping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/grouping/</guid><description>Grouping is the first step for creating hierarchy. It serves to both combine and separate. As a process of combining, grouping transforms elements into larger elements.</description></item><item><title>Figure-Ground</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/figure-ground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/figure-ground/</guid><description>The first step towards ranking elements in your design, is establishing the figure-ground relationship. I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to the distinction between foreground and background several times already.</description></item><item><title>Layering</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/layering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/layering/</guid><description>Great! You&amp;rsquo;ve now established the figure-ground relationship. It&amp;rsquo;s time to establish the hierarchy between smaller groups of elements. I think it&amp;rsquo;s best to do this in different levels or layers.</description></item><item><title>Grid</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/grid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/grid/</guid><description>So far, you can establish figure-ground (foreground and background). Within those, you can create layers for each general &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo; of the hierarchy.</description></item><item><title>Contrast</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/contrast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/contrast/</guid><description>Contrast allows our eyes to see. Without it, everything would be the same, and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to distinguish different objects or elements in a design.</description></item><item><title>Alignment</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/alignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/alignment/</guid><description>Following contrast, alignment is the strongest principle. It does the same as contrast, but reversed and more general.</description></item><item><title>Proximity</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/proximity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/proximity/</guid><description>Together with alignment, proximity is the second strongest design principle.
Elements that are close together are perceived to be more related than elements that are farther apart.</description></item><item><title>Repetition</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/repetition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/repetition/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen the importance of repetition on a small scale, with patterns and alignment. Now we can take it one step further.</description></item><item><title>Balance</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/balance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/balance/</guid><description>The last of the five big principles is more of an umbrella principle. Balance talks about achieving balance between the previous four principles.</description></item><item><title>Proportions</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/proportions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/proportions/</guid><description>Proportion is a way of expressing how the magnitude of an element relates to that of another element. This could be the length of a line compared to the length of another line, or the scale of a square compared to another square, or the height of a circle compared to the height of a square.</description></item><item><title>Space</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/space/</guid><description>I intentionally left out any remarks about space in the previous chapter. People often forget the importance of space, even though it has many important applications.</description></item><item><title>Symmetry</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/symmetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/symmetry/</guid><description>The strongest principle of graphic design is balance, as it encompasses all the other principles. Balance and hierarchy, the magical duo of graphic design!</description></item><item><title>Tension &amp; Motion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/tension-and-motion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/tension-and-motion/</guid><description>These principles, tension and motion, have popped frequently throughout this course. They aren&amp;rsquo;t a necessary principle or element for a design to work, but they are often what makes a design dynamic and makes us feel like it comes to life.</description></item><item><title>Framing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/framing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/framing/</guid><description>In the chapter on proportions, I already stated the size of the media you use plays an important role.</description></item><item><title>Abstraction</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/abstraction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/abstraction/</guid><description>This course talked about mimicking the real world, quite often. Designs are appealing and clear, if they use human nature and physical principles we understand, instead of working against it.</description></item><item><title>Composition</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/composition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/composition/</guid><description>Hopefully you noticed that this course moved from the smallest possible pieces towards the biggest.
We started with basic elements (point, line, shape) Then continued with principles applicable to groups of elements And principles about larger areas or the whole general design And now we&amp;rsquo;re at the chapter that&amp;rsquo;s about the end product of every design: a composition.</description></item><item><title>The Design Process</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/the-design-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/the-design-process/</guid><description>In this course we have only discussed one topic at a time. The only remaining questions, for this final chapter, are therefore:</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/conclusion-what-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/conclusion-what-now/</guid><description>Pfew, that was a long course. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any more can be said about graphic design.
I also understand it might have been technical or theoretical at many points.</description></item></channel></rss>
