You&rsquo;ve learned how to use <strong>vanishing points</strong> to keep cubes in perspective. And how any other object can be put inside a cube for easy perspective.</p><p>If you want to draw more than one object, however, the perspective needs to be coherent. Two cubes right next to each other can&rsquo;t use completely different vanishing points, no matter how well-drawn. Additionally, the vanishing points an object uses can&rsquo;t be too close to each other or at wrong angles, as this creates an unrealistic, distorted perspective.</p><p>To make it easy to set up correct perspective for a complete drawing, a few rules have been invented.</p><h2 id=horizons>Horizons</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re standing in the desert, with nothing but (flat) sand in front of you. How then, is it possible that you can&rsquo;t see a tree standing six kilometres in front of you? I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing standing in the way to block your sight! Why do you only see sand?</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s because the earth isn&rsquo;t flat, but spherical. After about five kilometres, the surface of the earth has curved away and out of our sight. The place where this happens, is what we call the <strong>horizon</strong>: the line separating ground and sky.</p><p>In most scenes though, there will be many objects standing in the way&mdash;such as trees, buildings or people&mdash;which make the horizon less clear. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s still there, and it tells us something important about our view.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Of course, you can use a horizon that&rsquo;s not horizontal. But that&rsquo;s a stylistic choice that only applies in specific cases. Most of the time, don&rsquo;t fight human intuition.</p></div><p>The horizon is linked directly to the <strong>eye level</strong>. When you draw something, you&rsquo;re viewing the scene from a particular eye level, which simply means the place where your eyes are.</p><ul><li>A low eye level means you see things from below</li><li>A high eye level means you watch things from above.</li></ul><p>All you need is a <strong>well-placed horizon</strong> to communicate this eye level.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>How to communicate eye level of a drawing through a simple horizon line.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingPerspectiveHorizon.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="How to communicate eye level of a drawing through a simple horizon line." title="How to communicate eye level of a drawing through a simple horizon line." width=1280 height=450></picture></figure></p><h2 id=one-two-and-three-point-perspective>One, Two and Three Point Perspective</h2><p>In theory, you could have as many vanishing points as you want. But one, two or three are usually the best way to go. With that, you can create a simple &ldquo;grid&rdquo; in which your drawing takes place.</p><ul><li>Setup your horizon and vanishing points before you start.</li><li>Draw light &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; from all</li><li>Remember that vanishing points are where lines <em>converge</em> (or <em>vanish</em>). So, the guidelines will not be parallel, they will grow apart more and more as they get further.</li></ul><h3 id=one-point-perspective>One-Point Perspective</h3><p>One vanishing point is placed on the horizon line. Useful for very open scenes, such as a railway or landscape.</p><p>Okay, this determines what to do with angled lines, but what about perfectly horizontal and vertical lines? A new rule comes into play:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Parallel perspective property</strong>: Lines parallel or perpendicular to the horizon always stay the same.</p></blockquote><p>This is also true for two-point perspective.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of one-point perspective.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingPerspectiveOnePoint.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of one-point perspective." title="Example of one-point perspective." width=1024 height=400></picture></figure></p><h3 id=two-point-perspective>Two-Point Perspective</h3><p>Two vanishing points are used, both placed at a different point on the horizon line. Useful for when you look at the side or corner of an object.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of two-point perspective.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingPerspectiveTwoPoint.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of two-point perspective." title="Example of two-point perspective." width=1024 height=400></picture></figure></p><h3 id=three-point-perspective>Three-Point Perspective</h3><p>The same as two-point perspective, but with an extra vanishing point added somewhere above or below the horizon.</p><p>Useful for when you view something from a very low or high eye level. The rule about vertical lines staying the same isn&rsquo;t applicable anymore. (This third vanishing point causes a more distorted perspective where you lose that property.) Instead, they converge towards the third vanishing point.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of three-point perspective.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingPerspectiveThreePoint.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of three-point perspective." title="Example of three-point perspective." width=1024 height=400></picture></figure></p><h2 id=an-important-note>An Important Note</h2><p>You might have noticed that this way of creating perspective is ideal for cubes. Those have only parallel lines, so converging and creating the grid is easy!</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not true for any other shape. Some more advanced methods, such as four, five or six point perspective exist that turn your drawing into a sphere. But these still rely on the existence of parallel lines.</p><p>Instead, I want you to remember that we put lots of basic shapes inside boxes to make it easier to draw them. If you can draw a cube in perspective, you can draw anything in perspective!</p><p>Simply place the object inside a cube that matches the vanishing points. Subdivide the cube, if needed, to get the correct placement and proportions for what&rsquo;s within. Afterwards, remove the cube and the perspective should be perfect.</p><p>Lastly, vanishing points can be&mdash;and often will be&mdash;off-paper. In that case, draw arrows indicating the general placement of the vanishing point, and use those. If you work digitally, you can of course draw things <em>outside</em> the canvas you&rsquo;ll be exporting, and this isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><p>Draw something using one, two, or three-point perspective. Establish your horizon, establish your vanishing point(s), and draw random cubes that follow the guides you set out.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Exercise to practice overall perspective (one, two or three point).</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingPerspectiveExercise.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Exercise to practice overall perspective (one, two or three point)." title="Exercise to practice overall perspective (one, two or three point)." width=1024 height=400></picture></figure></p></div></div><div class="block-container style-visual secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-visual secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/drawing/coloring/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Coloring</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/drawing/texture/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Texture</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["A straight line representing your eye level (usually perfectly horizontal)","The position and orientation through which the world in your drawing is viewed","Perspective that uses a single vanishing point on the horizon","Perspective that uses two vanishing points on the horizon","Perspective that uses two vanishing points on the horizon, and one above or below","Lines angled in such a way that they all meet in the same point","In one- and two-point perspective, lines parallel or orthogonal to the horizon don't converge (but stay the same)"],terms:["Horizon","Eye level","One-point perspective","Two-point perspective","Three-point perspective","Converging lines","Parallel perspective property"],type:"terms"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
