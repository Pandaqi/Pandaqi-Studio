In a business meeting, clear drawings help visualize what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to say.</description></item><item><title>Tools &amp; Setup</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/tools-setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/tools-setup/</guid><description>We can&amp;rsquo;t draw with just our finger. Let&amp;rsquo;s get some tools set up. These days, there are two distinct ways to draw:</description></item><item><title>The Laws of Drawing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/laws-of-drawing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/laws-of-drawing/</guid><description>What makes a drawing good? Why is it that some people can draw a beautiful panda in ten minutes, while others struggle to draw a realistic box in an hour?</description></item><item><title>Lines</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/lines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/lines/</guid><description>Everything you draw is essentially a line. It&amp;rsquo;s not like you can create a three dimensional box by waving your pencil in the air.</description></item><item><title>Edges</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/edges/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/edges/</guid><description>Now that we know lines are the basis of every drawing, we understand the biggest problem: knowing which lines you should draw and which you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t draw.</description></item><item><title>Shapes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/shapes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/shapes/</guid><description>When multiple lines intersect to create a closed area, we call it a shape. When you look at an image closely, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than a bunch of shapes forming a visual illusion.</description></item><item><title>Rectangles</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/rectangles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/rectangles/</guid><description>The obvious first basic shape: the rectangle. I will use this name to refer to any shape that has four edges, to keep terminology simple.</description></item><item><title>Ovals</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/ovals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/ovals/</guid><description>I called this chapter ovals&amp;mdash;not circles&amp;mdash;because drawing perfect circles is rarely required in a drawing. Just as with rectangles, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter distorted and modified ovals when trying to draw 3D.</description></item><item><title>Construction &amp; Form</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/construction-form/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/construction-form/</guid><description>Now that you can draw the most important shapes, it&amp;rsquo;s time to dig deeper into that construction method. I already told you that you can use basic shapes to construct anything.</description></item><item><title>Cubes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/cubes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/cubes/</guid><description>Things in our world tend to be very cube-like. Our buildings are approximately cubes, our vehicles are approximately cubes, our smartphones and computers are cubes, the list goes on and on.</description></item><item><title>Spheres</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/spheres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/spheres/</guid><description>I explained how many drawings are cube-like. This mostly refers to (human-made) objects. Anything in nature, any living being, is more organic and will be more like a sphere.</description></item><item><title>Cylinders</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/cylinders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/cylinders/</guid><description>Let me tell you a secret. The favourite basic shape of the world is not the cube nor the sphere &amp;hellip; but a combination of both!</description></item><item><title>Pyramids &amp; Cones</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/pyramids-cones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/pyramids-cones/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the most important forms of all: cubes, spheres and cylinders. It&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the last two basic shapes, which are simpler and less common.</description></item><item><title>Intersections &amp; Organic Forms</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/intersections-organic-forms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/intersections-organic-forms/</guid><description>We are almost at the last phase of the drawing process: enrichment and detailing. But before we get there, we need to talk about the transition from those basic shapes to more complex and realistic shapes.</description></item><item><title>Detailing &amp; Enrichment</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/detailing-enrichment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/detailing-enrichment/</guid><description>Congratulations on making it this far! You&amp;rsquo;ve learned many fundamentals that already enable you to draw anything.
Create smooth, confident lines and curves Turn them into basic shapes in 2D Turn those into basic shapes in 3D Combine the basic shapes into anything And yet &amp;hellip; your drawings still look unrealistic and maybe boring.</description></item><item><title>Proportions</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/proportions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/proportions/</guid><description>Proportions are perhaps the second most important part of drawing. Because, once you know where you want to draw a line, you need to know how large the line should be.</description></item><item><title>Light</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/light/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/light/</guid><description>Without light we&amp;rsquo;d see, well, nothing. We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to distinguish between objects or even get a general sense of our surroundings.</description></item><item><title>Shading</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/shading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/shading/</guid><description>As previous chapter explained, shadows reveal light and form. Any light results in shadows elsewhere. Without them, the light would have no effect, and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see the world as clearly as we do.</description></item><item><title>Coloring</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/coloring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/coloring/</guid><description>Most drawings these days are in colour. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change much of your workflow or the principles behind the drawing, but it does require learning some colour theory, and how it interacts with shading your drawing.</description></item><item><title>Perspective</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/perspective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/perspective/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve already drawn many things in perspective. You&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to use vanishing points to keep cubes in perspective.</description></item><item><title>Texture</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/texture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/texture/</guid><description>With great lines and shading, you can now draw amazing objects. But only if they are smooth and solid!</description></item><item><title>Studies &amp; Reference</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/studies-reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/studies-reference/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you how to construct anything out of basic shapes and forms. I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you how to add realism and enrichment to your drawings.</description></item><item><title>The Right Mind-Set I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/the-right-mindset-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/the-right-mindset-i/</guid><description>Many people think they can&amp;rsquo;t draw. Or maybe they remember being awesome at drawing when they were young, but never draw anymore because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid to disappoint themselves.</description></item><item><title>The Right Mind-Set II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/the-right-mindset-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/the-right-mindset-ii/</guid><description>To make matters clear, and those statements from last chapter more concrete, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide you with a list of very useful guidelines.</description></item><item><title>Imagination &amp; Creativity</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/imagination-creativity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/imagination-creativity/</guid><description>Most of this course has been rules and guidelines which are generally best to follow. This means all your drawings might look quite alike.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/conclusion-what-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/conclusion-what-now/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve learnt everything! You are the Master of Drawing! Nah, I&amp;rsquo;m just kidding, of course. You&amp;rsquo;ve learnt all the fundamentals of drawing and probably a bit more than that.</description></item></channel></rss>
