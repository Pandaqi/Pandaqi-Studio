When you look at an image closely, you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s nothing more than a bunch of shapes forming a visual illusion. I&rsquo;m not talking about objects or parts of objects, I&rsquo;m only talking about pieces of a drawing that are visually different. A shadow, for example, is a shape as well, just as a highlight.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of how a real-life picture is also just a collection of shapes.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingShapesAreEverything.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of how a real-life picture is also just a collection of shapes." title="Example of how a real-life picture is also just a collection of shapes." width=1194 height=695></picture></figure></p><h2 id=drawing-from-real-life>Drawing from Real Life</h2><p>If you (only) want to draw from real life, we&rsquo;re already almost done here. I only need to explain a few things about shapes and techniques, and you&rsquo;re good to go. (You can draw confident lines. You can pick the right lines for the job. Everything is a shape made from lines. Done!)</p><p>I, however, think you want to be able to draw anything, not copy objects in front of you. The rest of the course is focussed on achieving that goal: drawing anything you can imagine.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about two common methods for drawing from real life: <strong>contouring</strong> and <strong>block-in</strong>.</p><h3 id=contouring>Contouring</h3><p>This sounds the simplest, but actually is the hardest. I can explain it with a few sentences. It might take years before you can look at something and immediately identify the contours.</p><p>Contouring simply means that you copy every shape you see directly to the paper. You don&rsquo;t need to know the structure behind the objects in your picture or how shading works. The individual lines you draw don&rsquo;t <em>mean</em> anything. You see the shape in front of you and you copy it. Only once you&rsquo;ve added all the shapes, will the drawing turn out like the real life object.</p><figure class="no-hover video"><figcaption class=side-note><span>Animation demonstrating the method of contouring, for drawing an object from real life.</span></figcaption><video width=100% controls>
<source src=DrawingContouring.webm type=video/webm>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></figure><h3 id=block-in>Block-in</h3><p>This method is a simplification of the contouring method. How? By reversing it.</p><p>Instead of drawing objects shape by shape, you draw the shapes around it (at the edges of the paper) where <em>nothing happens</em>. When done carefully, this eventually reveals the shapes you were trying to draw. The more often you refine your blocks, the smoother your shapes will be.</p><figure class="no-hover video"><figcaption class=side-note><span>Animation demonstrating the block-in method of drawing an object from real life.</span></figcaption><video width=100% controls>
<source src=DrawingBlockIn.webm type=video/webm>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></figure><h2 id=positive--negative-shapes>Positive & Negative Shapes</h2><p>The block-in method revealed an important principle. Any drawing is a set of so-called <em>positive</em> and <em>negative</em> shapes, balancing each other.</p><p>When you hold your pencil up in the air before your eyes, you see a pencil shape (obviously). Your focus is on the pencil, which is why it&rsquo;s called a positive shape. There is, however, something else you also (unconsciously) see: the space around the pencil. This space is mostly ignored by your brain, as it is blurred and empty, and therefore a negative shape.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of positive and negative space.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingNegativeSpaces.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of positive and negative space." title="Example of positive and negative space." width=784 height=504></picture></figure></p><p>Many people focus on drawing by trying to get the <em>positive</em> shapes right. They get all the attention! But if you&rsquo;re stuck, or you can&rsquo;t find a clear positive shape to use, it helps by focussing on the negative space instead. Mark all the space you certainly <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to use or that should <em>not</em> be filled. That&rsquo;s why these are also sometimes called <strong>trapped shapes</strong>.</p><p>As you can see, positive shapes are surrounded by negative shapes. Objects are surrounded by empty spaces without any object. When it comes to drawing, both of these shapes are important.</p><h2 id=the-four-rules-of-shape>The Four Rules of Shape</h2><p>It&rsquo;s possible that &ldquo;just draw the shapes as you see them&rdquo; is a bit overwhelming. I will therefore list the four rules of shape, which are always a good starting point.</p><ol><li><strong>Start Large</strong>. Draw large shapes first, then smaller shapes. Start with a general outline of each object, or maybe even a general outline of multiple objects at the same time. Squinting your eyes or rotating the image can help notice the largest of forms and shapes.</li><li><strong>Enrich</strong>. Distinguish between those major shapes by adding details and shading. Look for shapes that enrich what you already have, such as highlights, shadows, reflections, patterns, or textures. All of these are also shapes by themselves, although not always as obvious or simple as you think shapes to be.</li><li><strong>Connect.</strong> Tie shapes together to simplify the drawing, and make your life easier. You might think this adds to the confusion, but it actually greatly reduces it. Instead of adding all sorts of small scribbly lines and subtle tone differences, everything is unified and the viewer automatically interprets it the right way.</li><li><strong>Think &ldquo;Negative&rdquo;</strong>. When you see a trapped shape, draw it. Trapped shapes inherently reveal the positive shapes.</li></ol><p>Note that points 2â€“4 are in no particular order. As illustrated with the drawing below, you can apply them in any way you like.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of applying the 4 rules of shape.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingRulesOfShape.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of applying the 4 rules of shape." title="Example of applying the 4 rules of shape." width=1500 height=400></picture></figure></p><h2 id=imaginative-drawing>Imaginative Drawing</h2><p>You&rsquo;re surely eager to know how you can draw anything that pops into your head. For this, the only &ldquo;method&rdquo; available is called <strong>construction</strong>.</p><p>Everything can be constructed out of basic shapes. A laptop is nothing more than a rectangle with some details. A roll of biscuits is a cylinder. A light bulb is a sphere/ball with a smaller cylinder at the bottom.</p><p>By deconstructing your idea into basic shapes, you get a clear path to drawing it.</p><p>Because basic shapes are easy to learn and to draw, like <em>rectangles</em> and <em>ovals</em>. I&rsquo;ll also include some variations on those, like <em>ellipses</em>, <em>trapezoids</em>, <em>egg-like shapes</em>, and more. Next chapters will tell you all about those!</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>A quick example on construction and drawing from imagination</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingFromImagination.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="A quick example on construction and drawing from imagination" title="A quick example on construction and drawing from imagination" width=1100 height=1024></picture></figure></p><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><p>After such a general and abstract chapter, there aren&rsquo;t really exercises to be done. All I can say is: if you have the time, find an interesting object, and try drawing it using the methods I provided. Especially try to see and draw the negative shapes. Go wild!</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-visual secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-visual secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/drawing/edges/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Edges</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/drawing/rectangles/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Rectangles</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["Drawing outlines and visible edges of an object as you see them","Drawing blocks of negative space around an object to reveal its form","Drawing big shapes first, maybe multiple objects as one, then the smaller ones","Making shapes come to live by adding details (such as shading or texture)","Merging shapes together to keep the drawing simple and clean","Focusing on the empty space around objects, instead of merely the positive space"],terms:["Contouring","Block-in","Start large","Enrich","Connecting","Thinking negative"],type:"terms"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
