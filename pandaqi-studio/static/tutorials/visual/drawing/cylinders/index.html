The favourite basic shape of the world is not the cube nor the sphere &mldr; but a combination of both! The cylinder can be found everywhere. It&rsquo;s often an even better shape to approximate form than a cube. A tree trunk is a bunch of cylinders, as well as its branches. The human body is best approximated with a cylinder, as well as most animal spines. Really, they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p><h2 id=whats-a-cylinder>What&rsquo;s a Cylinder?</h2><p>A cylinder is what happens when you add depth to a circle ( = extend a circle in the z-direction). The top and bottom sides are flat circles. In between those is a tube connecting them. It&rsquo;s basically a bunch of flat circles stacked on top of each other. This means:</p><ul><li>Use ellipses for the top/bottom</li><li>Use straight lines for the part in between</li></ul><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>How to draw a basic cylinder.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingBasicCylinders.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="How to draw a basic cylinder." title="How to draw a basic cylinder." width=1200 height=450></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Yes, this means that a cylinder is just a circle in &ldquo;perfect top-down view&rdquo;, and just a rectangle in &ldquo;perfect side view&rdquo;.</p></div><h2 id=cylinders-in-perspective>Cylinders in Perspective</h2><p>As usual, the straight lines should converge into the distance. This automatically means the side that is <em>furthest away</em> should be represented by the <em>smallest ellipse</em> (of the two).</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to make a distinction here between the <em>size</em> of an ellipse and its <em>degree</em> (or <em>width</em>).</p><p>The side further away is smaller&mdash;we learned that from cubes and vanishing points. But, because of its different position, we&rsquo;re also looking at it <em>from a slightly different angle</em>! So the degree should change as well.</p><p>I hope the image clarifies this more.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>How to draw cylinders in perspective, using ellipse foreshortening.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingCylindersInPerspective.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="How to draw cylinders in perspective, using ellipse foreshortening." title="How to draw cylinders in perspective, using ellipse foreshortening." width=1200 height=450></picture></figure></p><h2 id=putting-cylinders-in-boxes>Putting Cylinders in Boxes</h2><p>As usual, there&rsquo;s always the option of drawing a cube around it. Simply draw your cube like you normally would, nothing fancy, but make sure to <em>draw through</em> it. This means that you draw the lines at the back, which you normally don&rsquo;t see, as well.</p><p>Now turn the front and back face into the top/bottom of a cylinder. Just draw an ellipse inside.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>An example of using a box to draw cylinders in perspective.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingCylindersInBoxes.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="An example of using a box to draw cylinders in perspective." title="An example of using a box to draw cylinders in perspective." width=1080 height=750></picture></figure></p><p>You&rsquo;ve probably noticed that some of my ellipses are rotated. That&rsquo;s good, because it is very important!</p><p>We&rsquo;ve thus far only used vanishing points as guidelines for drawing rectangular shapes. But we can also use them for ellipses and circular shapes.</p><blockquote><p>Make sure that the <em>minor axis</em> of the ellipse converges at the same vanishing point as the parallel box lines.</p></blockquote><h2 id=contour-lines>Contour Lines</h2><p>The contour lines for the cylinder are somewhat unique. They have two different sets.</p><ul><li>In the rectangular direction, we have nothing but straight lines.</li><li>In the other direction, we have nothing but smaller and smaller ellipes.</li></ul><p>Together, all these lines form a nice grid for you to see how the form of your cylinder works.</p><p>Like constructing spheres, it&rsquo;s important to change the degree of the ellipse when moving in three-dimensional space.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of contour lines on cylinders; creating two seperate grid-like shapes</span></figcaption><picture><img src=DrawingContouredCylinders.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of contour lines on cylinders; creating two seperate grid-like shapes" title="Example of contour lines on cylinders; creating two seperate grid-like shapes" width=1360 height=450></picture></figure></p><h2 id=exercise>Exercise</h2><p>Not surprisingly, these exercises should also be done as often as possible. My university notebooks are filled with cylinders :p</p><h3 id=simple-cylinders>Simple Cylinders</h3><p>Draw a cylinder in side view. (Not <em>perfect</em> side view, but slightly angled or distorted.) This means that all you need is two ellipses parallel to each other, and two lines connecting them.</p><figure class="no-hover video"><figcaption class=side-note><span>A simple exercise to get comfortable drawing any cylinder.</span></figcaption><video width=100% controls>

Use one, two or three vanishing points (whatever you like). Now draw the cylinder inside it. (If possible, use erase/hide the cube afterwards. So you can see how nice the perspective of the cylinder is now.)</p><figure class="no-hover video"><figcaption class=side-note><span>Advanced exercise, using cubes to create cylinders in perspective.</span></figcaption><video width=100% controls>
<source src=DrawingCylindersPerspectiveExercise.webm type=video/webm>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></figure><h3 id=cylinders-with-connections>Cylinders with Connections</h3><p>As usual, an exercise to combine all you&rsquo;ve learned into something slightly more interesting than a basic shape.</p><p>Draw a cylinder. Add the contour lines. Now, at random spots, connect cubes or other cylinders to it.</p><p>Make sure to follow those contour lines. Don&rsquo;t forget the rules of perspective on the shapes you connect to it! When in doubt, check the tree in the image at the start of this chapter: it makes heavy use of (distorted) cylinders.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-visual secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-visual secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/drawing/spheres/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Spheres</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/visual/drawing/pyramids-cones/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Pyramids & Cones</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{actions:["Draw a cylinder in perspective?","Draw a cylinder in perfect op or bottom vie?","Rotate the cylinder's ellipses correctly?","Differentiate between the two faces of the cylinder?"],options:["Put the cylinder into a well-drawn cube","A regular circle","Align the minor axis with the vanishing point","Draw the ellipse furthest away smaller and with a different degree"],type:"actions"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
