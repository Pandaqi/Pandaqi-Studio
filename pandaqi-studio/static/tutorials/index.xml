That&amp;rsquo;s why any support for these has to come from a nifty little package called hyperref.</description></item><item><title>Space</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/space/</guid><description>I intentionally left out any remarks about space in the previous chapter. People often forget the importance of space, even though it has many important applications.</description></item><item><title>Studies &amp; Reference</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/studies-reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/studies-reference/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you how to construct anything out of basic shapes and forms.

You&amp;rsquo;ve read and worked through the whole course. The hard part is over.
Why? Because any language you&amp;rsquo;ll use in the future will have the things I mentioned.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conclusion/</guid><description>This concludes the course about learning to code.
Hopefully, I was able to ignite a spark. That&amp;rsquo;s why I learned to code, so long ago.</description></item><item><title>Determiners</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/determiners/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/determiners/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve mastered the basics of English language &amp;hellip; almost.

They aren&amp;rsquo;t a necessary principle or element for a design to work, but they are often what makes a design dynamic and makes us feel like it comes to life.</description></item><item><title>The Right Mind-Set II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/the-right-mindset-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/the-right-mindset-ii/</guid><description>To make matters clear, and those statements from last chapter more concrete, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide you with a list of very useful guidelines.</description></item><item><title>Clock &amp; Dates</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/clock-and-dates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/clock-and-dates/</guid><description>Denoting time is one of the oldest functions of a language.

The main purpose of LaTeX was to easily write clear and beautiful (scientific) papers or lasting documents for global consumption.</description></item><item><title>Abstraction</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/abstraction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/abstraction/</guid><description>This course talked about mimicking the real world, quite often. Designs are appealing and clear, if they use human nature and physical principles we understand, instead of working against it.</description></item><item><title>Common Mistakes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/common-mistakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/common-mistakes/</guid><description>In this course, I&amp;rsquo;ve often left remarks about the best way to write things. I find this important. Language is about communication, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how to improve that communication as much as possible.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/conclusion-what-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/conclusion-what-now/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve learnt everything!

We started with basic elements (point, line, shape) Then continued with principles applicable to groups of elements And principles about larger areas or the whole general design And now we&amp;rsquo;re at the chapter that&amp;rsquo;s about the end product of every design: a composition.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/conclusion/</guid><description>Congratulations!

The only remaining questions, for this final chapter, are therefore:</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/conclusion-what-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/graphic-design/design-principles/conclusion-what-now/</guid><description>Pfew, that was a long course. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any more can be said about graphic design.
I also understand it might have been technical or theoretical at many points.</description></item></channel></rss>
