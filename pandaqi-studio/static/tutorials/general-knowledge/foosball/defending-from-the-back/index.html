If you take away all the possibilities for the opponent to score, well, you only need to score <em>one</em> goal to win! And in foosball, every moment the other team has the ball, you should be defending.</p><p>Many people make the mistake thinking that only the <em>goalkeeper + defenders</em> are for defence. They rely completely on those to save every shot. But truth is, those two just can&rsquo;t save every shot. Plus, the earlier you intercept the ball, the earlier you can start attacking.</p><p>What does this mean? The person holding the midfield and attackers has an <em>equally important</em> defensive position as the person holding the goalkeeper and defenders. If the midfielders are positioned in a certain way, the defender must position themselves somewhere <em>else</em>. Otherwise they both defend the same thing&mdash;they both plug the same hole in defence, leaving all other holes wide open.</p><p>Below I will show you different situations in the game and the best way for the defending player to behave / move. The attacking player&rsquo;s duties will be discussed next chapter.</p><h2 id=defending-in-general>Defending in general</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re holding the defending rods, you should always be alert. Wherever the ball is in the field, there&rsquo;s always a good chance it will come flying towards goal.</p><p>Your goal as a defender is: any ball that comes near your 2-rod (the defenders) should be stopped and controlled there.</p><p>Any shot that isn&rsquo;t a goal, will hit the wall next to your goal or hit your keeper and bounce off. Which means &mldr; you have one chance to control it, and that&rsquo;s the role of your 2-rod.</p><blockquote><p>Any ball that passes your 2-rod (towards your goal), should be controlled before it goes back to the midfield again.</p></blockquote><p>The opponent has <em>one</em> chance to shoot. After that, your 2-rod should have the ball.</p><blockquote><p>Cover the easiest shots. These are &ldquo;open shots&rdquo;: when you&rsquo;re able to draw a line from the ball directly into your goal.</p></blockquote><p>This way you <em>force</em> your opponent to try a more difficult shot. Which will, most of the time, fail.</p><h2 id=defending-against-opponents-backline>Defending against opponent&rsquo;s backline</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s say the ball is around midfield or further up the field.</p><h3 id=in-front-of-goal>In front of goal</h3><p>Is the opponent&rsquo;s position within the range of your goal? Then a straight shots available. You know what to do: defend those.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t make the mistake of just placing your men directly in the shot line. You have <em>two</em> rods. You can cover a wider area:</p><ul><li>Place your men about one cm apart</li><li>Aligning that <em>gap</em> with the straight shot the opponent can make.</li><li>This gap looks like an open shot, but is too small for a ball to actually go through it.</li></ul><p>Now the opponent <em>has</em> to do something else. It has to move out of the way and go around your block.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of defending straight shots from opponent&rsquo;s backline.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=Foosball08.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of defending straight shots from opponent&rsquo;s backline." title="Example of defending straight shots from opponent&rsquo;s backline." width=568 height=284></picture></figure></p><h3 id=at-the-edge>At the edge</h3><p>Is the ball to the edge of the table? The only open shot is an <em>angled</em> shot towards your goal. The corner of the goal nearest to the ball, is called the <em>near corner</em>. The one on the other side is called the <em>far corner</em>.</p><p>You should always defend near corner. It&rsquo;s the easier shot and the faster shot. A shot in the far corner, <em>if</em> placed correctly, gives you more time to react.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of defending angled shots from opponent&rsquo;s backline.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=Foosball09.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of defending angled shots from opponent&rsquo;s backline." title="Example of defending angled shots from opponent&rsquo;s backline." width=569 height=284></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The vague dark green men in the picture show the best setup for if the ball is on the lower part of the table.</p></div><p><em>I see you&rsquo;re rotating the men?</em> This depends on your qualities and playing style.</p><p>If your toe points forward, you have a bigger range of shots you intercept. But! If you hit the ball, it most likely bounces away.</p><p>If your toe points backward, any ball you deflect will more likely stay in your control.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I prefer rotating the 2-rod <em>backward</em>, and the keeper <em>forward</em>. Balls that bounce off the keeper will go to my 2-rod anyway, so that&rsquo;s fine.</p><p>This also allows you to leave a larger <em>gap</em> between them when it comes to angled shots.</p><p>In a sense, you have to ask yourself the question: are my reflexes quick enough to make up for that loss of range?</p><p>And always ask yourself: what <em>can</em> the opponent do? From the defensive line, the most common options are:</p><ul><li>Pass to midfield</li><li>Push/pull the ball a bit and shoot angled. (Because of the pulling, the ball&rsquo;s momentum is already angled, which makes this shot easier.)</li></ul><p>With the setup shown above, many shots are guarded. But you still need to keep an eye open for these kind of shots. Those shots are usually a bit slower, so if you see one coming you should have enough time to move one of your men to that ball.</p><p>Any other shot: simply do not move your defences. Trust that there is no way in, unless you <em>know</em> the attacker is creative or can take crazy shots.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I can&rsquo;t count the number of times goals were scored because someone <em>panicked</em>. They actually had the shot saved, but frantically moved out of the way.</p></div><h2 id=defending-against-opponents-attackers>Defending against opponent&rsquo;s attackers</h2><p>Now, let&rsquo;s ay the ball is on the opponent&rsquo;s 3-rod (attackers). Things get a little bit trickier.</p><p>The distance between the 3-rod and your goal is not so large anymore, which makes a lot of &rsquo;easy&rsquo; shots available.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The options are largest for the middle man. As such, a somewhat capable attacker will automatically bring the ball to the middle man. Be prepared for that.</p></div><p>The techniques described above are still the best way to defend. But now you need to step it up a notch. With two key improvements:</p><ul><li><em>Great</em> reflexes and prediction of the game.</li><li>Psychological defense.</li></ul><p>Why the reflexes? The attacker will likely constantly change the placement of their men and the ball. You need to instantly know what to do and setup your defences correctly.</p><p>But, a better way to defend is &mldr;</p><blockquote><p>Never let your attacker control you. You control the attacker.</p></blockquote><p>This is called psychological defence. It takes some experience&mdash;and a bit of poker face&mdash;to get used to it.</p><p>What usually happens when the attacker receives the ball on the 3-rod? Something like this:</p><ul><li>They get the ball</li><li>They control the ball</li><li>They look at an opening in your defence</li><li>They set up the ball</li><li>They shoot.</li></ul><p>While they get the ball and control it, you need to get your defensive men in the best positions (as described above). Then the attacker will look at your defence.</p><p>Now it&rsquo;s your job to estimate when the attacker is done looking at your defence &mldr;</p><p>&mldr; because once your opponent has seen your defence, he probably won&rsquo;t look again and will start executing the right shot.</p><p>That will give you an opportunity to switch positions. And repeat. Constantly switch your position <em>slightly</em>. Any time you think the attacker is comfortable or confident, change it again.</p><p>Pretend to leave something open. Defend using the rules above for 90% of the game, but sometimes suddenly switch to some completely different configuration. Make the attacker unsure.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>How to defend against the attacker rod.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=Foosball10.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="How to defend against the attacker rod." title="How to defend against the attacker rod." width=568 height=284></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>You can obviously combine this with trash talk or something similar. Not required, of course. Something simple like &ldquo;score it then, score it in the near corner, I&rsquo;ll leave it open for you&rdquo; can do wonders.</p></div><h2 id=an-example>An example</h2><p>An attacker receives the ball at their middle men.</p><p>You know: cover the straight shot. Position your keeper and 2-rod to leave a gap just small enough to stop the straight shots.</p><p>The attacker has checked out your defence and saw that a straight shot is hopeless. But he spotted the upper corner is <em>just</em> out of your reach.</p><p>They subtly switch hand position, or stop looking.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the moment when you subtly move your keeper to cover that other side. And your defender a little bit upwards to make it look like the straight shot is still covered, just in case.</p><p>Hopefully, the attacker doesn&rsquo;t reconsider the straight shot again, and just hopelessly rams the ball against the exact place your keeper is now.</p><p>The reverse is also possible: make it look like a very easy shot can be made, but in reality have it covered. An example of this could be where you leave a certain shot <em>just</em> open, but your hand is ready to clamp down and instantly shut the opening. When when the attacker shoots, you quickly close it.</p><p>Again, this is mostly <em>psychology</em> and <em>prediction</em>. You could be wrong. You could close a gap, but the opponent shot somewhere else anyway, and now they scored. The trick is, of course, to be <em>right</em> more often than you&rsquo;re <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>Most players don&rsquo;t even think this far ahead. They just think &ldquo;shoot, shoot, shoot&rdquo;. These tricks will be enough to throw anyone off their game.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-general-knowledge secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-general-knowledge secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/general-knowledge/foosball/shooting/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Shooting</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/general-knowledge/foosball/defending-from-the-front/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Defending from the front</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
