Of course, you have 8 of them, and they are at the front of the battlefield.</p><p>But why are they so special or important?</p><p>Because they are worth so little, but can do so much. A chain of pawns is the ideal defence, because no player wants to sacrifice their pieces (which are worth more) just to break through.</p><p>A pawn that reaches the back rank can be promoted to the most valuable piece in the game: the queen.</p><p>A group of pawns focussed on the center can seriously limit your opponent&rsquo;s movement options.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why you should always strengthen your <strong>pawn structure</strong>. And break the enemy&rsquo;s pawn structure.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll first introduce the concept of <em>pawn islands</em>. Then I&rsquo;ll discuss three types of pawns you <strong>do</strong> want to have, and two types you <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> want to have.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Overview of pawn structure in chess.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=ChessPawnStructure.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Overview of pawn structure in chess." title="Overview of pawn structure in chess." width=825 height=500></picture></figure></p><h2 id=pawn-islands>Pawn Islands</h2><p>Pawn islands are groups of pawns, isolated from each other. A pawn is isolated if there&rsquo;s no pawn in the 8 squares around it. The rule here is:</p><blockquote><p>The fewer pawn islands, the better.</p></blockquote><p>A group of pawns will always be able to guard each other, or attain such a position within one or two moves. It therefore creates an impenetrable fortress on that part of the board.</p><p>On the other hand, if a pawn of yours is lonely, it is often unwise and hard to guard it. It will be captured easily. The best pawn structure is one consisting of a maximum of 2â€“3 islands.</p><p>The most ideal structure is one where all pawns are <strong>connected</strong> and / or <strong>chained</strong>.</p><h2 id=connected-pawns>Connected Pawns</h2><p>Pawns are connected if they stand right next to each other. They not only threaten the four squares in front of them, the squares they occupy are also considered <strong>strong squares</strong>.</p><p><em>Why?</em> Because if one of them is threatened, it only takes a single move to solve the problem. Step one pawn forward, and now you have <em>chained pawns</em>.</p><h2 id=chained-pawns>Chained Pawns</h2><p>Pawns are chained if they are offset diagonally, such that every pawn is defending another. This creates a chain that starts from the pawn that is most to the front, and ends with one pawn in the heart of your defence.</p><p>Chained pawns are actually <em>weaker</em> than connected ones.</p><ul><li>They threaten fewer squares</li><li>They leave a diagonal gap.</li><li>That one pawn at the heart is an overworked piece.</li></ul><p>As such, at least ensure you guard that last pawn in the chain very well. If that one falls, the whole structure crumbles and your defence is almost lost.</p><p>As such, <em>don&rsquo;t</em> chain pawns unless you <em>have to</em>. By keeping pawns connected, you keep your options open, and the opponent guessing. Chaining pawns prematurely actually shows your hand and reduces your options.</p><h2 id=passed-pawns>Passed Pawns</h2><p>Passed pawns are pawns that won&rsquo;t get into trouble if they walk right into the opponent&rsquo;s defence. There is no enemy pawn on their file or the ones right next to it. An opponent will rarely sacrifice a piece for a pawn, which means passed pawns are relatively safe and can do a lot of damage if used properly.</p><h2 id=double-pawns>Double Pawns</h2><p>We speak of double pawns if there is more than one pawn (of yours) on the same file. This can happen over the course of the game when a pawn captures something.</p><p>Double pawns are <em>dreadful</em>. The pawn at the back is completely blocked by the one in the front. It&rsquo;s almost useless, as it also can&rsquo;t defend the pawn in front of it. They also leave vertical gaps in your defence.</p><p>They are only good if you have double pawns in the center or near the opponent&rsquo;s back line. There, they can wreak havoc with the four squares they threaten.</p><h2 id=isolated-pawns>Isolated Pawns</h2><p>Isolated pawns are lonely pawns. They can&rsquo;t receive support from your other pawns (because they are more than one file away), but they also can&rsquo;t just walk through your opponent&rsquo;s defence because they <em>do</em> have a pawn that can block it.</p><p>You <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> want to have these.</p><p>It usually means you will lose that pawn, somewhere during the game, and won&rsquo;t be able to gain anything from it.</p><h2 id=pawn-majorities>Pawn Majorities</h2><p>In the endgame, having a <strong>pawn majority</strong> becomes very important. If you have more pawns than your opponent at the kingside/queenside, you can simply burst through their pawn structure by force. This weakens the opponent&rsquo;s defence. And if you&rsquo;re lucky, you can promote your leftover pawns or use them for checkmate.</p><p>In general, you want to keep your pawn structure strong and intact during the opening and middle game. But, if you find a way to safely advance your pawn into enemy territory, you should do it. An advanced pawn can restrict the opponent&rsquo;s options and aid in devastating attacks.</p><p>Also, timing is crucial in advancing your pawns. If you start the game by advancing all of them &mldr; you might create an intricate pawn structure, but there&rsquo;s acres of space behind it and not much to guard the weakest links in the chain.</p><p>Only advance a pawn if it can be done safely, which sometimes means one or two pawns enter the game very, very late.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-general-knowledge secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-general-knowledge secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/general-knowledge/chess/openings/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Openings</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/general-knowledge/chess/light-dark-square-tactic/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Light-Dark Square Tactic</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
