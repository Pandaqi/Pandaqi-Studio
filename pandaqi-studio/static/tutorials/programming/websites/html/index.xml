To create even a basic website, you need to learn multiple &amp;ldquo;computer languages&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>What is HTML?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/what-is-html/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/what-is-html/</guid><description>HTML means HyperText Markup Language. Well, what does that mean?
It&amp;rsquo;s a markup language, not a coding language. That means it structures content you give it, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t add &amp;ldquo;logic&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Tags &amp; Elements</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/tags-elements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/tags-elements/</guid><description>Earlier, I explained how HTML is a markup language. It marks parts of your content as being something. Like you&amp;rsquo;d use a marker pen to highlight important parts of a textbook.</description></item><item><title>Semantics</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/semantics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/semantics/</guid><description>Many courses on HTML don&amp;rsquo;t talk about this, or leave it until the end. I put it at the start because it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely the most important thing to learn right now.</description></item><item><title>Page Structure: Head &amp; Body</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/page-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/page-structure/</guid><description>Every piece of content has two major parts: the content itself, and information about the content. For example, a video has the video itself, but also a title, thumbnail, upload date, etcetera.</description></item><item><title>Blocks</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/blocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/blocks/</guid><description>Last chapter, we learned about the first and biggest &amp;ldquo;structure&amp;rdquo; in every HTML document: head and body. Now let&amp;rsquo;s go one step further, to the second largest subdivision you&amp;rsquo;ll create.</description></item><item><title>Paragraphs &amp; Headings</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/paragraphs-headings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/paragraphs-headings/</guid><description>Most of the internet consists of text. Even primarily image or video based websites, like YouTube, still have loads of text.</description></item><item><title>Lists</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/lists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/lists/</guid><description>Most people think of lists as a visual thing. They think about bullet points in a PowerPoint presentation, or a grocery list with an arrow in front of each item.</description></item><item><title>Text Formatting</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/text-formatting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/text-formatting/</guid><description>Moving on, we&amp;rsquo;ve now reached pretty much the smallest elements you can give meaning. These are all inline elements, added around small pieces of content.</description></item><item><title>Code Formatting</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/code-formatting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/code-formatting/</guid><description>Once you try to format something related to computers or code, you run into an issue. Your webpage is code, but its content is also code.</description></item><item><title>Comments</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/comments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/comments/</guid><description>Like any computer language, HTML provides the ability to leave comments. Such comments are are completely ignored by the computer&amp;mdash;they are for you, the programmer.</description></item><item><title>Attributes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/attributes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/attributes/</guid><description>This course has moved from our biggest tags to the smallest ones. But even those are quite limited: you&amp;rsquo;ve only seen about ~20 tags up to this point, that&amp;rsquo;s not enough to describe all possible content!</description></item><item><title>URLs</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/urls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/urls/</guid><description>Before we can talk about links, I need to explain how a URL works. Most people only know URLs from the long strings of symbols in the address bar of your browser.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/links/</guid><description>The internet isn&amp;rsquo;t called the world wide web for no reason. From the start, it was designed to be an inter connected network of servers.</description></item><item><title>Figures</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/figures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/figures/</guid><description>The next few chapters will all explain essential elements for displaying media (images, audio, video, &amp;hellip;). Though not required&amp;mdash;nothing is &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; in HTML&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to nest all such elements inside a &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt; element.</description></item><item><title>Images</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/images/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/images/</guid><description>Images are very straightforward. To add one, use the &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag (which is a void element). Without anything else, it obviously doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what image to load.</description></item><item><title>The Picture Element</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/the-picture-element/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/the-picture-element/</guid><description>The &amp;lt;picture&amp;gt; element allows specifying multiple versions of an image. The browser loads the best one, based on your requirements.</description></item><item><title>Audio</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/audio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/audio/</guid><description>In the old days of the internet, adding audio or video was a pain in the behind. But for a good 10+ years now, these elements are supported everywhere and very, very simple to use.</description></item><item><title>Video</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/video/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/video/</guid><description>The video tag is very similar to the Audio tag. That&amp;rsquo;s why this chapter will be very short.</description></item><item><title>Tables</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/tables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/tables/</guid><description>As expected, the &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; element is meant for content that is a table. Tables are complicated, however, so it requires a lot of other tags to add the proper structure.</description></item><item><title>Forms I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/forms-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/forms-i/</guid><description>Forms in HTML are used to collect user input (and submit it). Interactivity is a huge part of webpages and the internet, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ll spend several chapters on this topic.</description></item><item><title>Forms II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/forms-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/forms-ii/</guid><description>Last chapter taught you the overall structure of a form: how to create one, how to label inputs, and how to submit the data.</description></item><item><title>Input I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/input-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/input-i/</guid><description>In the previous chapters, I already showed a few ways to use the &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; tag. For example, you use it for the submit button of a form, but also a basic empty text field.</description></item><item><title>Input II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/input-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/input-ii/</guid><description>Continuing on last chapter, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about some more types you can set on the &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; element. These are less common, with the most specific (and thus least common) ones all the way at the end.</description></item><item><title>Head I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/head-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/head-i/</guid><description>At the start of this course, twenty chapters ago, I introduced the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;. Everything after that only handled elements for the body.</description></item><item><title>Head II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/head-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/head-ii/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the other web languages, CSS and JavaScript, many times during this course. I never mentioned how you actually include those other languages in your webpage, once you&amp;rsquo;ve written code for them.</description></item><item><title>Entities</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/entities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/entities/</guid><description>You are almost at the end of the HTML course. Hopefully, you&amp;rsquo;ve already tried to built a few websites to test your skills and practice them.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/conclusion/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve seen all that HTML has to offer. (Barring some very specific and niche elements or ideas.) The language hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much over the past 10+ years.</description></item><item><title>Miscellaneous</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/miscellaneous/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/html/miscellaneous/</guid><description>I wanted to talk about a few more elements that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit anywhere else. (And which were too simple or short to get their own dedicated chapter.</description></item></channel></rss>
