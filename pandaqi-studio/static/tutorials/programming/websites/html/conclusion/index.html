(Barring some very specific and niche elements or ideas.) The language hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the past 10+ years. It doesn&rsquo;t need much more, nor can it lost much more. As such, once you have this basic grasp of HTML, you can safely move on and never look back.</p><p>As I mentioned at the start, however, simply reading about something doesn&rsquo;t teach much. You have to <em>do</em> something with the knowledge, practice it, and use it in practical ways.</p><p>Most websites are <em>not</em> built from scratch, by writing the HTML for each page, by hand. Fortunately not! Countless tools exist to simplify your life. They allow you to create a few <em>templates</em> which are re-used across all websites. They allow you to write a little bit of code, which is then exported into a lot of (correct) HTML.</p><p>Some tools don&rsquo;t require you to know HTML, though you might need it for more advanced ideas.</p><p>Most tools <em>do</em> require this knowledge of HTML, at least enough to use and debug the tool.</p><p>So don&rsquo;t think your time learning HTML is wasted. It is most certainly not. If you have any interest in web development, HTML is crucial knowledge, and now you have it.</p><p>Below I will list a few tools to build websites faster. Then I will end with a list of courses you should try next, which obviously starts with those languages CSS and JavaScript I&rsquo;ve mentioned hundreds of times.</p><h2 id=markdown>Markdown</h2><p>Most written content follows the same structure. You have headings, paragraphs, perhaps a few images or links, and that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>Writing a complete HTML page for each article would be annoying.</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s slow and takes a lot of typing to get all the elements right.</li><li>The articles are much harder to read, with all the HTML in the way.</li><li>If you ever wanted to transform the articles to a different format, you&rsquo;d need to waste even more time pulling out all the HTML you put in!</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s why Markdown was invented. (Or similar higher-level markup languages.)</p><p>All tutorials on this website, and probably 95% of the pages across all my websites, are written in Markdown.</p><p>It provides simple symbols to mark up text articles. Then, you can feed that into another tool, and it will quickly transform it into a correct HTML page. For example,</p><ul><li><code># Lala</code> means it is a <code>&lt;h1></code></li><li><code>## Lala</code> means it is a <code>&lt;h2></code></li><li>Regular text automatically becomes paragraphs</li><li><code>[Pandaqi](https://pandaqi.com)</code> makes a link</li><li><code>![Some alt text](path/to/image.png)</code> adds an image</li></ul><p>Markdown is so simple, that you&rsquo;ve already learned it now. What if you need more? What if you need something else?</p><p>Tada: you just use regular HTML! You&rsquo;ve already learned everything you need to know. For basic articles, use fast and easy Markdown. If you need anything else, you now have the tools to write your own bit of HTML that does exactly what you want.</p><p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend creating content in this format. In the end, these are just text files that are <em>very</em> easy to read and digest. You can easily copy-paste them, reuse them in other tools down the road, or change them with any old text editor you can find.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This comes from somebody who wrote his first tutorials, blog posts, and more in a variety of different formats. Think of Microsoft Word, a Wordpress Blog, and more. All of those mean that your content is embedded in their <em>system</em>. Which means it is EXCRUCIATINGLY hard to extract or re-use in a different way.</p></div><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>In the future, I might create a (very) short course on how to use Markdown. But it&rsquo;s not a big priority, as there are many AWESOME websites that interactively teach you Markdown already.</p></div><h2 id=static-site-generators>Static Site Generators</h2><p>This is the next step. What do I use to transform that Markdown into this beautiful website you&rsquo;re seeing here? I use a <em>static site generator</em>.</p><p>There are many. Jekyll, Octopress, Pelican, Hugo, you can look them all up.</p><p>I use Hugo. It&rsquo;s&mdash;to me&mdash;by far the fastest, best maintained, and easiest to use.</p><ul><li>I create a few templates. These are HTML files with, for example, the header of the website, the footer, etcetera.</li><li>Then I simply write my tutorials in Markdown. They are automatically placed inside the template for an &ldquo;article&rdquo;. This means that all the HTML stuff gets out of my way. I only need to write it <em>once</em>, and it&rsquo;s used for <em>all pages</em>.</li><li>I can also create &ldquo;shortcodes&rdquo;. These are, again, HTML files that do one specific thing. For example, I have a shortcode for one code example on this website.</li><li>Within my Markdown files, I can just type &ldquo;hey, use that shortcode, and fill it with this example code&rdquo; &mldr; and it does all that for me.</li></ul><p>As such, I only need to write HTML whenever I design a <em>new</em> website and have to create all my templates and shortcodes. After that, I can focus 100% on the creation of content, knowing the system will export some beautiful HTML at the end.</p><p>At least, that&rsquo;s how &ldquo;static&rdquo; site generators work. You build the website on your PC. When you&rsquo;re ready, you <em>export</em> it, and you get one folder filled with <code>.html</code> files. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> the folder you upload to your server, whenever you want to update your website.</p><p>The &ldquo;static&rdquo; means that, once uploaded, your website doesn&rsquo;t <em>do</em> anything anymore.</p><p>The alternative is a website with a <em>database</em>. But that requires multiple other languages, which is why I&rsquo;m not including that option in this conclusion.</p><h2 id=where-to-go-now>Where to go now?</h2><p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend following these courses, in this order.</p><ul><li><a href=../../css/>CSS</a>: for styling your webpage. Add color, change font, position everything correctly, and so forth.</li><li><a href=../../javascript>JavaScript</a>: for interaction and execution on your webpage. Create games, web apps, animations, whatever.</li><li><a href=../../php/>PHP</a>: for a <em>dynamic</em> (not static) website, which can change a page on the server before it is send to a user.</li><li><a href=../../sql/>SQL</a>: to be used in tandem with PHP, this language actually queries the database in useful ways.</li><li><a href=../../canvas/>Canvas</a> and <a href=../../svg/>SVG</a>: these are used to dynamically create graphics on the web. For example, they are instrumental in the creation of web <em>games</em>.</li></ul><p>In the future, I might focus more courses on that Hugo framework I explained, or similar frameworks. If I forgot to update this list, shoot me an email.</p><p>It might feel overwhelming that you need <em>multiple</em> languages to build a modern, completely functional website. I get it. I want to remind you that the alternative would be that <em>everything</em> (markup, styling, code, databases) was taught in ONE course, in the SAME language. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be even more overwhelming?</p><p>Building websites isn&rsquo;t easy. Like anything, it&rsquo;s hard enough to be worth learning and getting good at. But the fact that they split it into many smaller languages, actually makes it easier to digest. You can focus on one thing at a time. You can take a break after finishing a new course.</p><p>You can already build 5 websites just using your HTML knowledge, and only start learning CSS once you&rsquo;re comfortable.</p><h2 id=farewell>Farewell</h2><p>With that said, I bid thee farewell!</p><p>That sounds dramatic. I guess I get overly attached to courses I&rsquo;m writing, after spend <em>many hours</em> on them :p</p><p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s it for HTML. I hope to see you at the CSS and JavaScript courses, or any other course here. If you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this course, let me know. If you haven&rsquo;t enjoyed it, also let me know what you think could be improved.</p><p>As always, keep <em>building websites</em> and <em>doing stuff</em>! That&rsquo;s how you learn. That&rsquo;s actually the fun part.</p><p>Keep learning,</p><p>Pandaqi</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-programming secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-programming secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/programming/websites/html/entities/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Entities</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/programming/websites/html/miscellaneous/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Miscellaneous</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
