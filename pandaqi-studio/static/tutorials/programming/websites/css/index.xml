It&amp;rsquo;s the language used to style websites. To give them a certain visual design and appearance.</description></item><item><title>Linking CSS &amp; HTML</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/linking-css-and-html/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/linking-css-and-html/</guid><description>CSS cannot stand on its own. It merely styles something that already exists. As such, you need content first&amp;mdash;something to style&amp;mdash;and then connect the two.</description></item><item><title>The Only Syntax</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/the-only-syntax/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/the-only-syntax/</guid><description>Despite its size, CSS is an extremely simple language. All of it follows the same syntax! Once you learn this simple structure, you know how to write 99% of CSS.</description></item><item><title>The Basic Selectors</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/basic-selectors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/basic-selectors/</guid><description>Before we can style anything, we first need to select the thing we want to style. This chapter explains a handful of basic selectors&amp;mdash;the simplest ones that you&amp;rsquo;ll use the most often&amp;mdash;so we can quickly start with actually creating designs.</description></item><item><title>Inheritance &amp; Layers</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/inheritance-and-layers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/inheritance-and-layers/</guid><description>The previous chapters explained how to select a specific element. It also taught the basic syntax for adding styles to them, although we haven&amp;rsquo;t really explored that part yet.</description></item><item><title>Values I: Units</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/values-i-units/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/values-i-units/</guid><description>When in school, you probably had an angry physics teacher at one point. You wrote down the answer to the question: &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Values II: Colors</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/values-ii-colors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/values-ii-colors/</guid><description>In a language all about (visual) design, color obviously plays a huge role. I considered leaving this for later, using only basic color names like &amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo; in all my examples.</description></item><item><title>The Well-Styled Web Page</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/the-well-styled-web-page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/the-well-styled-web-page/</guid><description>Next chapter we will finally start building an actual website and learning all the different CSS properties. As promised at the start, this will be from BIG to SMALL.</description></item><item><title>The Box Model</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/the-box-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/the-box-model/</guid><description>Previous chapter taught you that CSS views everything on the page as a box. A rectangle with a certain size and location.</description></item><item><title>Positioning</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/positioning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/positioning/</guid><description>Last chapter explained how CSS boxes automatically grow, but also how you can control those dimensions (to some extent).</description></item><item><title>Columns</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/columns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/columns/</guid><description>Previous chapters explained how to determine the size and position of one element. Usually, though, you want to do both at the same time, for multiple elements.</description></item><item><title>Flexbox</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/flexbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/flexbox/</guid><description>Flexbox is the next concept to learn that decides both where to place multiple elements and their size at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Grid</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/grid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/grid/</guid><description>The introduction of the CSS grid module was a major milestone. It is extremely powerful, versatile and useful. It gives finetuned control over the size and position of all elements within the grid.</description></item><item><title>Masks &amp; Clipping</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/masks-and-clipping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/masks-and-clipping/</guid><description>A few chapters ago, I explained &amp;ldquo;the box model&amp;rdquo; and ways to change its dimensions. This is extremely useful &amp;hellip; but it still looks like a box.</description></item><item><title>Filter</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/filter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/filter/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re almost done with our chapters about the biggest decisions in your design. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how to change the dimensions of an element and its overall shape.</description></item><item><title>Transform</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/transform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/transform/</guid><description>Last chapter mentioned we had two more properties to go that could do massive changes to your design with just one line.</description></item><item><title>Background</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/background/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/background/</guid><description>Over the years, the name background has become somewhat misleading. Yes, of course, these properties will help you set a background (color or image) for your CSS element.</description></item><item><title>Gradients</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/gradients/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/gradients/</guid><description>If you thought the examples from last chapter were crazy, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a treat. CSS natively supports creating gradients, which has been a never-ending source of tricks and creative designs ever since.</description></item><item><title>Text I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/text-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/text-i/</guid><description>Perhaps this was the chapter you&amp;rsquo;d been waiting for. I can understand that, but hopefully you agree now that changing properties of the text is a minor change, relatively speaking.</description></item><item><title>Text II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/text-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/text-ii/</guid><description>The previous chapter introduced many basic ways to manipulate how text is displayed on your website. I glossed over one major change, however, which is &amp;hellip; the actual font!</description></item><item><title>Border</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/border/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/border/</guid><description>When I explained the box model&amp;mdash;quite some chapters ago by now&amp;mdash;one of the four properties was the border. By default, this is invisible, which allowed me to ignore it until now.</description></item><item><title>Lists</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/lists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/lists/</guid><description>One element that receives a lot of default styling is the list. Without doing anything, browsers will add bullets in front of items and shift them a bit to the right.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/links/</guid><description>Links are another element that receives quite some styling by default. When you learned HTML, you probably noticed that (hyper)links automatically get a border underneath them.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo-Classes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/pseudo-classes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/pseudo-classes/</guid><description>The word &amp;ldquo;pseudo-class&amp;rdquo; is, in my eyes, needlessly convoluted and intimidating. Its application and syntax are actually very simple.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo-Elements</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/pseudo-elements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/pseudo-elements/</guid><description>Last chapter, I remarked how I found the name pseudo-classes a bit unhelpful. This chapter, however, might shed some light on why they chose that name.</description></item><item><title>Transitions &amp; Animations</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/transitions-and-animations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/transitions-and-animations/</guid><description>At this point in the course, you have seen pretty much every major part of CSS. You should be able to create good-looking websites with that and almost any design you envisioned.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/variables/</guid><description>You have written (or studied) a lot of CSS by now. And you might have noticed an annoying issue: a lot of repetition.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Selectors</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/advanced-selectors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/advanced-selectors/</guid><description>At the start of this course, I mentioned that I only explained the basic selectors to you. As a quick refresher, here they are again.</description></item><item><title>Counters</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/counters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/counters/</guid><description>We are now entering the territory of CSS functionality that you might or might not need. Depending on your designs and content, these chapters might be crucial to you &amp;hellip; or mean nothing.</description></item><item><title>Math Functions</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/math-functions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/math-functions/</guid><description>Let me tell you a secret. Throughout this course, you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen that CSS has many functions. Any time a syntax involved parentheses (()), you were calling some built-in CSS function.</description></item><item><title>Media Queries</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/media-queries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/media-queries/</guid><description>Near the start of the course, I briefly mentioned the @media syntax for so-called media queries. I explained how they allow you to enable/disable CSS rules only for specific media.</description></item><item><title>Web to Print</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/web-to-print/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/web-to-print/</guid><description>This chapter will talk about specific CSS properties and syntax to style a page for print. These only go into effect when you visit a webpage and try to print it.</description></item><item><title>Forms &amp; Input</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/forms-and-input/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/forms-and-input/</guid><description>Forms and input are tricky. Most of it is completely handled by browsers: their functionality, checking input validity, even what they look like.</description></item><item><title>Tables</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/tables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/tables/</guid><description>Last chapter talked about the endless default styling of forms and input, which needs a multitude of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style yourself.</description></item><item><title>Text III</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/text-iii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/text-iii/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of this course. This chapter just has some minor properties related to text. The next one has even more properties that only apply in very specific situations.</description></item><item><title>Interactivity</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/interactivity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/interactivity/</guid><description>Honestly, this chapter contains the leftovers. Things that I deem important enough to explain and teach, but didn&amp;rsquo;t really belong anywhere else.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/websites/css/conclusion/</guid><description>Congratulations! You did it! This is the final chapter in the CSS course. You&amp;rsquo;ve learned the basic syntax, most of the properties, many gotchas and practical tips for building websites.</description></item></channel></rss>
