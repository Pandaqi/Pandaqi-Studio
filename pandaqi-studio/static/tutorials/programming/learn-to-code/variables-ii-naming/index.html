But can you use <em>any</em> name for your variable? The answer is <strong>no</strong>, but it&rsquo;s close.</p><p>The same key rules exist in all programming languages. Because they are a direct result of how a computer works.</p><p>How does it know you&rsquo;re typing variable? And not a calculation? Or a number? Or one of those keywords (like <code>say</code>)?</p><p>It can only decipher this (quickly) by establishing a few rules. Variables <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> &mldr;</p><ul><li>&mldr; start with a number. (But can use them later on.)</li><li>&mldr; contain a special symbol, like a <em>space</em>. (Some languages might have a few exceptions.)</li><li>&mldr; be named <em>exactly</em> like an existing keyword. (Try it. Try creating a variable named &ldquo;say&rdquo;.)</li></ul><p>This is how the computer knows the difference between &ldquo;this text is a variable&rdquo; and &ldquo;this text is something else&rdquo;.</p><p>In general, just use regular letters (lowercase or uppercase) and you&rsquo;re fine.</p><h3 id=cases>Cases</h3><p>But if you can&rsquo;t add spaces, how do you keep things readable? We often want multiple words or parts in our variable names.</p><p>For this, we invented several different &ldquo;cases&rdquo;.</p><ul><li><strong>camelCase</strong> = capitalize every word except the first</li><li><strong>PascalCase</strong> = capitalize every word</li><li><strong>snake_case</strong> = add an underscore (<code>_</code>) between words, all lowercase</li><li><strong>kebab-case</strong> = add a dash (<code>-</code>) between words, all lowercase</li></ul><p>The last one is rare, as the minus sign is usually reserved for subtraction. For my language, I thought camelCase was the best, so that&rsquo;s what my examples use.</p><h2 id=in-practice>In practice</h2><p>Once named, you can use your variable everywhere and however you want. As you saw in the examples, whenever we type the name again, it <em>recognized</em> it. The computer just grabs its current value and uses that.</p><p>What does this mean for the practical world? How would you use variables?</p><p>In this course, I also want to nudge you towards <em>good</em> programming habits. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you this now:</p><blockquote><p>Naming variables is the most important skill in coding</p></blockquote><p>Or <em>one of</em> the most important. I mean that in all seriousness.</p><p>Think back to the analogy. If your code is filled with jars labeled &ldquo;Butterfly&rdquo; while they could actually contain <em>any other insect</em>, your code will crash and burn. Working on it becomes a confusing chore. What is where? What&rsquo;s the latest value of this one thing?</p><p>You might say: &ldquo;<em>well then, I&rsquo;ll just give everything a generic name!</em>&rdquo; All jars are labeled &ldquo;insect&rdquo;.</p><p>The computer can only have one jar called insect. Each variable name can only appear once. When re-used, it overwrites the previous value. So what, you&rsquo;re going to call them &ldquo;insect1&rdquo;, &ldquo;insect2&rdquo;, and so on?</p><p>Now you might say: &ldquo;<em>well then, I&rsquo;ll give everything an extremely specific name!</em>&rdquo; This jar is called &ldquo;Butterfly with red wings and long antennas caught on September 3rd&rdquo;.</p><p>I wish you good luck writing that in camelCase&mdash;every single usage üòâ</p><p>As usual, the solution is down the middle.</p><blockquote><p>Use many variables that say&mdash;in one to three words&mdash;exactly what they contain.</p></blockquote><h3 id=example-bad>Example: bad</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s do an exercise. Look at the code below. The variables have short names with simple English words. Nice, right? But do you have any idea what the data actually <em>means</em>?</p><div class=data-transformation-container><div class=data-transformation><div class=icon><img class=no-hover src=/tutorials/icon/data_transformation.svg></div><div class=from>Two Numbers</div><div class=arrow>&nbsp;=>&nbsp;</div><div class=to>Number</div></div></div><figure class="pq-bamboo no-hover" data-disabled data-fbresult=true data-fblog=true data-fbkeyword=true data-fbvalue=true data-fbparser=true data-fbcomment=true data-folded=false><div class=bamboo-fold>Click to unfold (and show solution)</div><div class=code-block><textarea class=code-block-input>

This code is for an online multiplayer game. Each game is played on a new <em>server</em> with a <em>group</em> of 4 players: 2 versus 2.</p><p>The problem it tries to solve: how many servers do we need to keep online?</p><p>Without my explanation, you&rsquo;d have never known this.

Like <code>num</code> for number. Or <code>ev</code> for event. As long as they are clear and unique, that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p><p>Naming variables also depends on personal preference or your project. For example, you might change the first variable to <code>numPlayersOnline</code> if your game also supports <em>offline</em>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to accidentally steer the wrong way here.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You might think <code>players</code> is enough. But it&rsquo;s not. Players could mean <em>anything</em>! Is it a list with all the players? Is it the username of each player? No, we want the <em>number</em> of players.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Similarly, <code>groupSize</code> is better than just <code>group</code>.

Not just its <em>size</em>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Some people add the type into the name. If your code converts a string to a number, you might have two variables: <code>resultString</code> and then <code>resultNumber</code>. However, only do this when <em>necessary</em>. Most of the time, a variable is clearly one type at a glance.</p></div><p>Be as specific as needed, but not more.</p><p>Now, if you change the number of players to, say, <code>10</code>, your code will run fine. But the output is actually bad. How do you activate &mldr; 2 and a half server?</p><p>Next chapters talk about common keywords for manipulating data even further. Such as <em>rounding</em> that sad half server to a whole one!</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-programming secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-programming secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/variables-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Variables</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conditionals-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Conditionals I</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
