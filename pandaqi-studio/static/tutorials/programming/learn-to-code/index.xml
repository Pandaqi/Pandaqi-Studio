A problem to solve&amp;mdash;or a puzzle, that sounds more fun.
Say you&amp;rsquo;re making a game.</description></item><item><title>Data Types</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/data-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/data-types/</guid><description>Data types will always be your first step into any programming language&amp;mdash;or any problem. That&amp;rsquo;s not surprising: you already know that coding is just &amp;ldquo;changing data&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/variables-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/variables-i/</guid><description>Alright, you can now define data (bool, number, string) and do some calculations. But once you have your result, you want to store it somewhere.</description></item><item><title>Variables II: Naming</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/variables-ii-naming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/variables-ii-naming/</guid><description>Previous chapter introduced you to the wonderful world of giving names to everything. But can you use any name for your variable?</description></item><item><title>Conditionals I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conditionals-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conditionals-i/</guid><description>What you&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is already very powerful. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ve played around with the examples, tried writing your own little programs.</description></item><item><title>Conditionals II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conditionals-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conditionals-ii/</guid><description>Last chapter introduced turning everything into a bool. And then using that to determine if we want to execute a group of code or not.</description></item><item><title>Numbers</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/numbers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/numbers/</guid><description>This chapter is probably most fun if we use an example throughout. (Otherwise, numbers easily become abstract and, well, boring.</description></item><item><title>Strings</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/strings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/strings/</guid><description>String transformations are more fun and specific than the ones for numbers. But they are also more varied, with a huge number of possible things you might want to do.</description></item><item><title>Comments &amp; Space</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/comments-and-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/comments-and-space/</guid><description>Human language uses a lot of space. We put a space between every word! We put space around text in a book.</description></item><item><title>Loops I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/loops-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/loops-i/</guid><description>A crucial principle in programming is &amp;ldquo;DRY&amp;rdquo;: Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself. That&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of a computer: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind executing the same task 1000 times for you.</description></item><item><title>Loops II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/loops-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/loops-ii/</guid><description>Last chapter introduced you to loops. It also teased a different way to play with how many (or which) iterations are executed.</description></item><item><title>Bags I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/bags-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/bags-i/</guid><description>Loops really start to shine when you combine it with repeated data: a bag full of values. They&amp;rsquo;re like twins.</description></item><item><title>Bags II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/bags-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/bags-ii/</guid><description>Last chapter teased the idea of naming the elements inside your bag. Like we give names to things in the real world.</description></item><item><title>Bags III</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/bags-iii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/bags-iii/</guid><description>What can we do so far? We can define a bag and get what&amp;rsquo;s inside. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all you can do with a bag.</description></item><item><title>Machines I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-i/</guid><description>Congratulations! You&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at the final boss of programming. Not necessarily because it&amp;rsquo;s hard, but because it&amp;rsquo;s the most important and powerful tool.</description></item><item><title>Machines II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-ii/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to define (or &amp;ldquo;create&amp;rdquo;) a machine and how to tell it to do something. But just like our coffee machine needs beans to create coffee, most machines you write will need some input.</description></item><item><title>Machines III</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-iii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-iii/</guid><description>As you know by now, I am fond of recreating functionality yourself. Even if a language supports something (with an easy keyword), I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great exercise to try and code it yourself.</description></item><item><title>Machines IV</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-iv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/machines-iv/</guid><description>This is the last chapter with exercises / examples for machines. As you noticed, machines get more chapters than any other topic!</description></item><item><title>Debugging</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/debugging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/debugging/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a secret. As a programmer, you actually don&amp;rsquo;t spend most of your time programming. Instead, most of the time you are reading or fixing code in a process called debugging.</description></item><item><title>Data Manipulation I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/data-manipulation-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/data-manipulation-i/</guid><description>In these two chapters, I want to give a few slightly more &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; ways for manipulating data. Again, every programming language will have these.</description></item><item><title>Data Manipulation II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/data-manipulation-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/data-manipulation-ii/</guid><description>In the Strings chapter, I promised some more &amp;ldquo;bag-like&amp;rdquo; operations to do on strings. They can be extremely important or not important at all, depending on your project.</description></item><item><title>Where to go now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/where-to-go-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/where-to-go-now/</guid><description>Well done! You&amp;rsquo;ve read and worked through the whole course. The hard part is over.
Why? Because any language you&amp;rsquo;ll use in the future will have the things I mentioned.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/conclusion/</guid><description>This concludes the course about learning to code.
Hopefully, I was able to ignite a spark. That&amp;rsquo;s why I learned to code, so long ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
