A problem to solve&mdash;or a <em>puzzle</em>, that sounds more fun.</p><p>Say you&rsquo;re making a game. You want the character to <strong>jump</strong> when the player presses spacebar. It won&rsquo;t happen magically. Hey, that&rsquo;s a puzzle we need to solve!</p><p>How do you get that character to jump? How do you know when the player presses spacebar? <em>How do you tell the computer how to solve this problem?</em></p><p>And that&rsquo;s where programming (or coding) comes in.</p><p>It provides a language, a <em>grammar</em>, for communicating your idea with the computer. For telling it what &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; means, or what &ldquo;spacebar&rdquo; means. The computer doesn&rsquo;t know! It&rsquo;s just a calculator! It only knows numbers and arithmetic.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I once heard a fun quote about this. &ldquo;Which one is smarter, a shoe or your smartphone?&rdquo; The answer &mldr; it&rsquo;s a tie. They&rsquo;re both equally dumb.</p></div><h2 id=the-coding-loop>The coding loop</h2><p>This means programming <em>always</em> has the following steps. You &mldr;</p><ul><li>Find your problem</li><li>Ask <strong>input</strong>: the information you need. (What&rsquo;s the status of that spacebar key?)</li><li>Turn it into numbers</li><li>Get <strong>output</strong>: convert the numbers into what you wanted to do. (How much should the player move upwards?)</li><li>Apply that to solve your problem!</li></ul><p>The formal term for this is <strong>&ldquo;data transformation&rdquo;</strong>. It just means you get some numbers as <em>input</em>, <em>change</em> them, then do something with that <em>output</em>. Because numbers are &ldquo;data&rdquo;. And &ldquo;transform&rdquo; is just another word for change.</p><p>As you read this course, you&rsquo;ll see that coding is just this loop over and over. And I&rsquo;ll give more tips about how to code <em>well</em>, now that you know about data transformations.</p><p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll remind you about this every time. Whenever I introduce a new idea or syntax, I&rsquo;ll add a little icon (<span style=display:inline><img style=max-height:1em;max-width:1em src=/tutorials/icon/data_transformation.svg></span>) and state the data transformation happening.

See if you can add more tasks to the list.</p><h2 id=example-3>Example 3</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s finish this chapter with a more challenging example. Let&rsquo;s try to write code for our &ldquo;player jumping&rdquo; example. (Like in a platformer game, such as Mario.)</p><p>Try to figure out the general idea&mdash;before reading the code. Think about the data transformation: what information do you put in? And how do you need to change it?</p><p>Sometimes it helps to make it more specific: what <em>exactly</em> do we want as output? Can we turn that into a <em>number</em>?</p><p>Jumping means going <em>up</em>, vertically, right? This means the computer needs some concept of <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em>. Fortunately, any software will have that by default. They are called the <strong>x-axis</strong> (horizontal) and the <strong>y-axis</strong> (vertical).</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not enough. What is <em>up</em>? The computer doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;it knows nothing. We need to <em>tell</em> it what we think is &ldquo;up&rdquo;. In our case, let&rsquo;s say that <em>higher numbers</em> means up. (So Y = 5 is more up than Y = 4.)</p><p>Now we&rsquo;ve turned our problem into <em>numbers</em>!</p><p>To make the player go up when spacebar is pressed, we also need this data:</p><ul><li>Where the player is <em>now</em>. We can&rsquo;t go &ldquo;higher than we are&rdquo; if we don&rsquo;t know where we are now!</li><li>Whether spacebar is pressed: either yes or no. In coding, this is often called <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></li></ul><p>Any &ldquo;game engine&rdquo; will have a simple function to check whether a key is pressed. (Or the mouse used, or a joystick moved, etcetera.)</p><p>Our wanted <em>output</em> is this new position of the player. What is this? It&rsquo;s their <em>old</em> position plus the <em>change</em>.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Data transformation for solving the problem &ldquo;make the player jump when spacebar pressed&rdquo;</span></figcaption><picture><img src=problem_solving_platformer.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Data transformation for solving the problem &ldquo;make the player jump when spacebar pressed&rdquo;" title="Data transformation for solving the problem &ldquo;make the player jump when spacebar pressed&rdquo;" width=992 height=424></picture></figure></p><p>Bringing it together, the code might look like this.</p><figure class="pq-bamboo no-hover" data-disabled data-fbresult=true data-fblog=true data-fbkeyword=true data-fbvalue=true data-fbparser=true data-fbcomment=true data-folded=false><div class=bamboo-fold>Click to unfold (and show solution)</div><div class=code-block><textarea class=code-block-input>

So let me tell you what I&rsquo;m working on <em>right now</em>. An actual, real-life, application of the ideas above.</p><h3 id=getting-a-random-word>Getting a random word</h3><p>I publish games under the <a href=https://pandaqi.com>Pandaqi</a> name. Lately, I had many ideas for <em>word games</em>.</p><p>Which gave me a problem: how do I get a random list of English words a player could draw / use?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s identify our data transformation.</p><ul><li><strong>Input</strong>: a big wall of text</li><li><strong>Change</strong>: convert the text into individual words</li><li><strong>Output</strong>: tell the player this selected word</li></ul><p>Where do we get our input? You probably just said: a dictionary. But &mldr; a paper dictionary obviously wouldn&rsquo;t do. Nor would an online website. Computers don&rsquo;t understand clicking, buttons and interfaces.</p><p>Computers calculate and see patterns, that&rsquo;s all. So they&rsquo;ll only understand the words if I give them in a predictable <em>pattern</em>.</p><p>I ended up creating a new text (<code>.txt</code>) file for each category of words. Within, I wrote every word on <em>its own line</em>. Then I can use code to detect when a new line starts: what follows will be a single word.</p><p>Tada! Now my code transforms the data correctly. It takes a file (input), cuts them into individual words (change), then gives me one random word from that list (output)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few weeks building this dictionary. Others have had the same idea &mldr; but I couldn&rsquo;t use theirs. My games have more specific requirements, such as words being easy enough that even a child would understand.</p><p>As you code more, you&rsquo;ll see this is often the case. Copy-pasting somebody else&rsquo;s code can be the solution. But your <em>problem</em> to solve is often (slightly) different, which means coding your own solution is better in the long run.</p><h3 id=generating-images>Generating images</h3><p>Similarly, I&rsquo;ve created board games where you can <em>randomly generate</em> a board! (Such as <a href=https://pandaqi.com/timely-transports>Timely Transports</a> or my first word game <a href=https://pandaqi.com/keebble>Keebble</a>.)</p><p>The data transformation is clear.</p><ul><li><strong>Input</strong>: the settings a player wants to use. (Number of players, paper size, difficulty, etcetera.)</li><li><strong>Change</strong>: convert these to visual marks on the page. (For example, place a &ldquo;starting square&rdquo; for each player.)</li><li><strong>Output</strong>: the final graphics as an image to download / print</li></ul><p>Look at any digital project with this perspective. You&rsquo;ll start to notice the data transformations making it all happen. Once you have an intuition for that, you&rsquo;re already 90% a professional programmer.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Next chapter will dive into actual code writing.
