It&amp;rsquo;s built on top of TeX, one of the first systems created to mark up documents.</description></item><item><title>Basic Syntax I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/basic-syntax-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/basic-syntax-i/</guid><description>Because LaTeX is a markup language, the majority of your file will simply be regular text. Therefore, something is needed to tell the computer when a piece of text is actually a command.</description></item><item><title>Basic Syntax II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/basic-syntax-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/basic-syntax-ii/</guid><description>Continuing on last chapter, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some more general syntax. These will become more and more important as you get deeper into working with LaTeX.</description></item><item><title>Spaces &amp; Reserved Characters</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/spaces-and-reserved-characters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/spaces-and-reserved-characters/</guid><description>Like most markup languages, LaTeX collapses whitespace. When it encounters multiple spaces, it reduces them to a single one.</description></item><item><title>Basic Structure</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/basic-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/basic-structure/</guid><description>Every document starts with the same few basic commands. Like telling Microsoft Word that you want the paper a specific size, Latex also benefits from knowing what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.</description></item><item><title>Document Classes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/document-classes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/document-classes/</guid><description>Document classes aren&amp;rsquo;t something to &amp;ldquo;understand&amp;rdquo;. You just need to know what&amp;rsquo;s out there and what options you have.</description></item><item><title>Sectioning</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/sectioning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/sectioning/</guid><description>The first step in creating any structured project is sectioning: dividing the text into sections, subsections and paragraphs. This creates hierarchy and clarity.</description></item><item><title>Counters</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/counters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/counters/</guid><description>As you&amp;rsquo;ve seen in last chapter, LaTeX automatically keeps separate counters for every type of section. What&amp;rsquo;s really nice is that it does the same for nearly everything&amp;mdash;tables, figures, table of contents, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Semantics &amp; Custom Macros</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/semantics-and-custom-macros/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/semantics-and-custom-macros/</guid><description>Before I start introducing command after command, I want to talk about something fundamentally important: semantics. Semantics means separating your markup and layout.</description></item><item><title>Text Formatting</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/text-formatting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/text-formatting/</guid><description>These first few chapters discussed very much the global workings and overall concepts in LaTeX. How to approach a new document, how to structure a project for success, etcetera.</description></item><item><title>Languages &amp; Special Characters</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/languages-and-special-characters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/languages-and-special-characters/</guid><description>Alright, we know LaTeX will justify text, hyphenate words, and generally try to make spacing and text look as good as possible.</description></item><item><title>Footnotes, References &amp; Citations</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/footnotes-references-citations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/footnotes-references-citations/</guid><description>Any scientific or documented piece requires footnotes, references, and citations. Luckily, LaTeX was mainly created for these purposes, which means it has very good support.</description></item><item><title>Alignment &amp; Simple Environments</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/alignment-and-simple-environments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/alignment-and-simple-environments/</guid><description>This chapter will talk about some very simple environments that are quite important. They are nothing fancy or complicated.</description></item><item><title>Fonts</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/fonts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/fonts/</guid><description>LaTeX has its own default font&amp;mdash;Computer Modern&amp;mdash;which looks great everywhere and in any size. It will be completely fine for most use cases.</description></item><item><title>Lists</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/lists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/lists/</guid><description>Even if your paragraphs are of the highest typographical quality, some things are better expressed using lists. As the name implies: they are ideal for listing numerous things.</description></item><item><title>Spacing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/spacing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/spacing/</guid><description>These default lists and settings are great. But it&amp;rsquo;s easily possible that you need different amounts of space between items, or more horizontal distance between label and item text.</description></item><item><title>Lengths</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/lengths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/lengths/</guid><description>Last chapter discussed the various ways you can add or remove extra space at any moment. This chapter will talk about the other side of that coin: the basic lengths that are applied throughout the whole document.</description></item><item><title>Tables I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/tables-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/tables-i/</guid><description>Tables are an invaluable tool for presenting data in a clean way. But they always come with a few complications.</description></item><item><title>Tables II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/tables-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/tables-ii/</guid><description>Last chapter introduced the basic concepts needed for a table. But we&amp;rsquo;re still stuck with a few tiny disadvantages.</description></item><item><title>Floats &amp; Protection</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/floats-and-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/floats-and-protection/</guid><description>The subjects from the title are completely unrelated. But they were too short to receive their own chapter, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss both at once.</description></item><item><title>Multiple Columns</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/multiple-columns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/multiple-columns/</guid><description>Columns aren&amp;rsquo;t natively supported by LaTeX. I know, that strange typesetting language keeps throwing curveballs.
But they are easily included with the help of the package multicol.</description></item><item><title>Hyperlinks &amp; URLs</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/hyperlinks-urls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/hyperlinks-urls/</guid><description>At the time TeX was introduced, hyperlinks and URLs weren&amp;rsquo;t as mainstream as they are now. That&amp;rsquo;s why any support for these has to come from a nifty little package called hyperref.</description></item><item><title>Figures &amp; Images</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/figures-and-images/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/figures-and-images/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen the table environment. It does nothing more than contain a table and any metadata, such as a caption or reference.</description></item><item><title>Special Pages I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/special-pages-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/special-pages-i/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already briefly seen the title page and table of contents at the start of every document. But there are more special pages that are usually included in LaTeX documents.</description></item><item><title>Special Pages II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/special-pages-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/special-pages-ii/</guid><description>Continuing on last chapter, here are the two other quite important special pages. The main purpose of LaTeX was to easily write clear and beautiful (scientific) papers or lasting documents for global consumption.</description></item><item><title>Pages Layouts &amp; Margin</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/page-layouts-and-margin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/page-layouts-and-margin/</guid><description>Until now we&amp;rsquo;ve silently accepted the size of the margins LaTeX decides. Not anymore! Let&amp;rsquo;s look changing the amount of white space around your document.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion: what now?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/latex/conclusion/</guid><description>Congratulations! You&amp;rsquo;re a LaTeX wizard now ✨
You&amp;rsquo;ve seen and played with the fundamentals of LaTeX. Even some slightly advanced topics.</description></item></channel></rss>
