I find this important. Language is about communication, so let&rsquo;s see how to improve that communication as much as possible.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve told you:</p><ul><li>To use active voice, instead of passive.</li><li>To modify words so they are easy to read or pronounce</li><li>To pick the <em>shortest</em> way of writing something. (Usually by picking the right verb and tense, plus using a lot of referencing.)</li></ul><p>This article continues that thought. It&rsquo;s about common <em>mistakes</em>, but also about simply <em>writing better</em>. Communicating better. Using the right words for the right job. Many expressions mentioned here are grammatically correct&mdash;maybe even popular&mdash;but should be restricted to speech.</p><p>Because what&rsquo;s the point of learning a language &mldr; if you only use it for vague and imprecise communication?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve sorted the mistakes on type. You can disagree with me on these topics! It&rsquo;s merely advice. My thoughts on how to communicate better.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The book <em>Elements of Style</em>&mdash;which I highly recommend&mdash;was the inspiration for this article.</p></div><h2 id=intensifiers>Intensifiers</h2><p>This category holds words that intensify other words. And explains why they are often a bad idea.</p><h3 id=absolutely>Absolutely</h3><p>Often redundant when used to emphasize adjectives. Either someone is honest, or he isn&rsquo;t. Absolutely honest doesn&rsquo;t make him more honest.</p><p>This is a general rule: instead of using &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; to intensify something, try to find a <em>stronger</em> verb or noun. &ldquo;Absolutely cold&rdquo; is simply &ldquo;freezing&rdquo;. &ldquo;Absolutely scary&rdquo; is &ldquo;frightening&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=amazing>Amazing</h3><p>Overused. Omit it, or at least find a more fitting synonym. If everything is amazing, nothing is.</p><h3 id=certainly>Certainly</h3><p>Used too often to intensify any and every statement. Remembe rthe general rule: find <em>one</em> word that says what you want precisely.</p><h3 id=really>Really</h3><p>Similar to &ldquo;<em>very</em>&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t use it to modify an adjective, verb or adverb. (At least, not often.) Find a stronger version of the word instead.</p><h3 id=so>So</h3><p>Avoid using it as an intensifier (<em>so good</em> or <em>so strong</em>).</p><h3 id=very>Very</h3><p>Use sparingly to exaggerate nouns. If emphasis is necessary, find a strong word.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Very tired => morose</li><li>Very happy => ecstatic</li><li>Very good => skillful, expert, unparalleled, whatever</li></ul></div><h2 id=unnecessary>Unnecessary</h2><p>These words are fine, but often <em>unnecessary</em>. Removing them makes communication only shorter and clearer.</p><h3 id=always>Always</h3><p>If you say something, it is by default <em>always true</em>. For example: &ldquo;When you add 2 and 2, you get 4.&rdquo;</p><p>There is <em>no need</em> to say: &ldquo;When you add 2 and 2, you ALWAYS get 4.&rdquo;</p><p>Similarly, &ldquo;I always go to the gym on Wednesdays&rdquo; is the same as simply &ldquo;I go to the gym on Wednesdays&rdquo;.</p><p>As such, this word can be removed 99% of the time.</p><h3 id=as-to-whether>As to whether</h3><p>Just <em>whether</em> is sufficient.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I like your idea. As to whether we should spend so much money on it, though &mldr;</p><p>I like your idea. Whether we should spend so much money on it, though &mldr;</p></div><h3 id=case>Case</h3><p>Usually unnecessary in these cases:</p><ul><li>Instance of a thing occurring</li><li>Usual state of affairs</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>In many cases, the houses had been destroyed => Many houses had been destroyed.</p></div><h3 id=character>Character</h3><p>Often redundant and used out of habit only.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Acts of a hostile character => Hostile acts</p></div><h3 id=clever>Clever</h3><p>Overused. Best restricted to ingenuity displayed in small matters. If something is really clever, it should <em>show</em> through the consequences or writing about it.</p><h3 id=dependable>Dependable</h3><p>A needless substitute for <em>reliable</em> or <em>trustworthy</em>.</p><h3 id=fact>Fact</h3><p>Use this only of actual facts, matters capable of direct verification. Never use this for matters of judgment, however incontestable they may be.</p><p>The phrase &ldquo;The fact is &mldr;&rdquo; can also be removed if you&rsquo;re not actually talking about a <em>verifiable fact</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The fact is that writing is hard. => Writing is hard to me.</p></div><h3 id=factor>Factor</h3><p>Overused. Can often be replaced by something more direct or definite.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Superior preparation was the biggest factor for his win. => He won by preparing better</p></div><h3 id=feature>Feature</h3><p>Like factor, it usually adds nothing to a sentence.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The homepage featured several images of toys. => The homepage shows images of toys.</p></div><p>To be avoided in the advertising sense of <em>offer as a special attraction</em>.</p><h3 id=he-is-a-man-who>He is a man who</h3><p>A common type of redundant expression. Of course, it has variations. &ldquo;She is a woman who&rdquo;, &ldquo;They are a child who&rdquo;, &ldquo;It is a country that&rdquo;, and more.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>England is a country which I like => I like England.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He is a man who likes to play games => He likes to play games</p></div><h3 id=honestly>Honestly</h3><p>Often used to add emphasis. But it should be avoided, for it implies that the rest of your statements weren&rsquo;t honest!</p><p>It&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;I will <em>lie</em> now&rdquo; and then continuing like nothing happened. Scrap it.</p><h3 id=just>Just</h3><p>Only use it for its original meaning (as a noun): <em>equitable, fair, even-handed</em> or <em>impartial</em>.</p><p>If used otherwise, it has no clear meaning and makes your sentences weaker.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>It is just cool to see fireworks => It&rsquo;s cool to see fireworks.</p></div><h3 id=literally>Literally</h3><p>Literally means something should be understood <em>exactly as it is said</em>. Figuratively means something should be understood <em>as a metaphor or figure of speech</em> for something else.</p><p>In most cases, people use the wrong one. In almost all cases, using it is unnecessary anyway.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He was literally dead with fatigue.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Hmm. Is he dead now? No. Then it&rsquo;s not <em>literally.</em></p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He was almost dead with fatigue.&rdquo; => &ldquo;He was very tired&rdquo; => &ldquo;He was exhausted.&rdquo;</p></div><h3 id=maybe>Maybe</h3><p>Communicates uncertainty. It is, therefore, great for questions or suggestions.</p><p>Any other time, it doesn&rsquo;t help in any way to add lots of insecurity to what you write. Remove it.</p><h3 id=nature>Nature</h3><p>Often redundant, just like <em>character</em>. Or more specific statements need to follow to explain it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Acts of a hostile nature => Hostile acts</p></div><h3 id=never>Never</h3><p>See &ldquo;always&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=oftentimes>Oftentimes</h3><p>Archaic. Use <em>often</em>.</p><h3 id=respectively>Respectively</h3><p>May usually be omitted. The reader assumes that the order in which you wrote the sentence, is the order you intended.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I swapped module A and B for module C and D, respectively.</p><p>We already assume that A swapped for C and B swapped for D. No need to add &ldquo;respectively&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The books are listed under the names of their respective authors => The books are listed under the names of their authors</p></div><p>In some kinds of formal writing (such as geometrical proofs) it is necessary for clarity. But it doesn&rsquo;t add much otherwise.</p><h3 id=student-body>Student body</h3><p>A needless expression, just <em>students</em> is enough.</p><h3 id=stuff>Stuff</h3><p>Casual and generic. A placeholder for when the writer doesn&rsquo;t know the actual word or phrase. If you don&rsquo;t bother finding out or explaining the details, don&rsquo;t reference something at all.</p><h3 id=system>System</h3><p>Frequently used without necessity. Like &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, <em>anything</em> can be a system, right?</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>They have adopted the commission system of government. => They have adopted government by commission.</p></div><h3 id=that>That</h3><p>Superfluous most of the time. Reread every sentence with <em>that</em> and see if you can leave it out.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He saw that the bird was eating => He saw the bird was eating.</p></div><p>Don&rsquo;t use it with people. They are not objects! The proper word is <em>who</em>.</p><h3 id=things>Things</h3><p>See &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=misspelling--misuse>Misspelling & Misuse</h2><h3 id=all-right>All right</h3><p>Alright has become more popular, but two separate words is technically correct. Used in familiar speech in the sense of <em>&ldquo;Agreed&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo;</em> or &ldquo;<em>Okay</em>&rdquo;. Avoid using it for anything else.</p><h3 id=bid>Bid</h3><p>Takes the infinitive without <em>to</em>. The past tense is <em>bade</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I bade him to do it => I bade him do it</p></div><h3 id=due-to>Due to</h3><p><strong>Correctly</strong> used when saying <em>because of</em> and then a particular noun.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Losses due to bad policy.</p></div><p><strong>Incorrectly</strong> used in adverbial phrases. (So, a seperate sentence giving a reason for the main sentence.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She lost the game, due to carelessness.</p></div><h3 id=effect>Effect</h3><p>As noun, means <em>result.</em></p><p>As verb, means to <em>bring about</em> or <em>accomplish.</em></p><p><strong>Not</strong> the same as <em>affect</em>: that means <em>&ldquo;to influence&rdquo;</em>.</p><p>Too often used as a vague substitute when discussing art or creative endeavours. Vagueness is bad.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The painter used very delicate effects. => What does this mean!? Be more precise.</p></div><h3 id=etc--etcetera>Etc. / etcetera</h3><p>Equivalent to <em>and the rest</em> or <em>and so forth</em>. Should therefore not be used for people. Or if the reader could be left in doubt as to what &ldquo;the rest&rdquo; could be.</p><p>Best used to shorten a list which has already been given in full. Or to replace unimportant words at the end of a quotation.</p><p>It is <strong>incorrect</strong> to end lists starting with <em>such as</em> or <em>for example</em> with &ldquo;<em>etc.</em>&rdquo;.</p><p><em>Why?</em> It&rsquo;s a bit weird to start a list of examples, and then just say: &ldquo;hey, you should just imagine how the other examples go!&rdquo;</p><h3 id=irregardless>Irregardless</h3><p>It&rsquo;s not a word. Regard<em>less</em> already means <em>without</em> regard.</p><h3 id=less>Less</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve stated this earlier in the course. I&rsquo;ll state it again because it&rsquo;s such a frequent error.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t replace it with <em>fewer</em>. <em>Less</em> only applies to uncountable nouns and comparing quantities.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Five is less than ten.</li><li>There were less holes in my garden than last year => There were <em>fewer</em> holes in my garden than last year</li><li>His troubles are less than mine => means his troubles are <em>smaller in size</em></li><li>His troubles are fewer than mine => means his troubles are <em>smaller in number</em></li></ul></div><h3 id=kind-of>Kind of</h3><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> use it as substitute for &mldr;</p><ul><li><em>Rather</em> (before adjectives and verbs)</li><li><em>Something like</em> (before nouns)</li></ul><p>Restrict it to its actual meaning. Kind means <em>type</em> or <em>embodiment</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He plays guitar with a strange kind of passion.</p></div><p>The same is true for <em>sort of</em>.</p><h3 id=one-of-the-most>One of the most</h3><p>Avoid beginning paragraphs with this kind of phrase. It takes many words, yet it&rsquo;s cliché, vague and meaningless.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The guitar is one of the most universally played instruments. => The guitar is a popular instrument.</p></div><p>It&rsquo;s not wrong. I just don&rsquo;t like those phrases with many words which can be removed.</p><h3 id=phase>Phase</h3><p>Means <em>stage of transition or development</em>. Does not mean <em>aspect</em> or <em>topic</em>.</p><h3 id=to-possess>To possess</h3><p>Don&rsquo;t use it as a substitute for the simpler verbs <em>have</em> or <em>own</em>. It needlessly complicates a sentence.</p><h3 id=to-state>To state</h3><p>Don&rsquo;t use it as a substitute for the specific <em>say</em> or <em>remark</em>. Restrict it to the sense of: <em>express fully or clearly</em>.</p><h3 id=while>While</h3><p>Don&rsquo;t use it as a substite for &ldquo;<em>and&rdquo;</em> or &ldquo;<em>but&rdquo;</em>. Instead, split the sentence in two, or use a semicolon.</p><p>Using it for &ldquo;<em>although&rdquo;</em> fine, if this doesn&rsquo;t lead to ambiguity or absurdity.</p><p>It&rsquo;s best to restrict it while to the sense of <em>during the time that</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I walked to the park, while Susan danced the tango</li><li>I walked to the park; Susan danced the tango</li><li>I walked to the park. Susan danced the tango.</li></ul></div><h3 id=whom>Whom</h3><p>A (slightly archaic) conjugation of <em>who</em> when it&rsquo;s the (in)direct object of a sentence.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>To whom should I address this letter?</p></div><p>Often incorrectly used for <em>who</em> before <em>he said</em> or similar expressions.</p><h2 id=clarification>Clarification</h2><h3 id=as-good-or-better>As good or better</h3><p>Rearrange the sentence so that &ldquo;<em>or better</em>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;<em>if not better</em>&rdquo;) is at the end. It&rsquo;s easier to read and understand.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>This is as good or better than that => This is as good as that, or better</p></div><h3 id=claim>Claim</h3><p>With object, means <em>lay claim to</em>. Don&rsquo;t use as a substitute for <em>declare, maintain</em> or <em>charge</em>.</p><h3 id=compare>Compare</h3><p>The preposition makes the difference.</p><ul><li>To <em>compare to</em> is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as different</li><li>To <em>compare with</em> is to point out differences between objects regarded as similar</li></ul><h3 id=consider>Consider</h3><p>When followed by <em>&ldquo;as&rdquo;</em> means <em>&ldquo;believe to be&rdquo;</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The report is considered <strong>as</strong> an example of good scientific journarling.</p></div><p>Otherwise means <em>&ldquo;examined&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;discussed&rdquo;.</em></p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He considered the writings on the wall.</p></div><h3 id=fix>Fix</h3><p>Colloquial (in American English) for <em>arrange, prepare</em> or <em>mend</em>. It&rsquo;s used, more and more, on <em>everything</em>. And when you use one word for everything, communication loses meaning.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I fixed the internt issues => I (re)solved the internet issues.</p><p>Hey, let me fix that for you => Hey, let me help you with that.</p></div><p>Restrict it to its original meaning: <em>to fasten, make firm</em>.</p><p>Or, as a noun (fixed), it means <em>rigid</em> or <em>immovable</em>.</p><h3 id=however>However</h3><p>Comes first in the sentence when it means &ldquo;<em>in whatever way</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>to whatever extent</em>&rdquo;.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>However hard you try, it won&rsquo;t happen.</p></div><p>Place it after the subject or verb otherwise.

But it&rsquo;s usually written as one word: <em>nearby</em>.</p><p><em>Near (at hand)</em>, however, is as good, if not better.</p><p>Not so nice as an adjective. I prefer <em>neighbouring</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We walked from our house to a nearby cottage. => We walked from our house to a neighbouring cottage.</p></div><p>Use &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; if something is <em>right next to</em> something else.</p><h3 id=one-hundred-and-one>One hundred and one</h3><p>Retain the <em>&ldquo;and&rdquo;</em> in this and similar expressions. Don&rsquo;t be tempted to write &ldquo;one hundred one&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=people>People</h3><p><em>The people</em> is a political term. They create political support or opposition.</p><p><em>The public</em> is the right word otherwise. Artistic appreciation or commercial support comes from &ldquo;the public&rdquo;.</p><p>Some people prefer using &ldquo;persons&rdquo; after a plural number, instead of &ldquo;people&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m on the fence about that.</p><h3 id=viewpoint>Viewpoint</h3><p>Don&rsquo;t use it for <em>view</em> or <em>opinion</em>.</p><p>I prefer <em>point of view</em>. But <em>viewpoint</em> has become more common and accepted. For example, when a book is told from the perspective of someone, they are called a &ldquo;viewpoint character&rdquo; now.</p><h3 id=went>Went</h3><p>Don&rsquo;t use <em>went</em> for every action in your story. Consider more definite statements, such as walked, ran, drove, cycled.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He went to the bar.
