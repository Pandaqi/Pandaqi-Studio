Only two more chapters. This one will talk about the many simple but <em>crucial</em> words for making everything work.</p><p>I could have sneakily spread them all throughout the course. (And I did, a bit, in the examples.) But I think that would have made it too messy and confusing. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m presenting it as one group here.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Determiners</strong> are placed in front of a noun to make clear to what it <em>refers</em></p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p><strong>My</strong> hat, <strong>these</strong> people, <strong>a few</strong> birds, <strong>ten</strong> children, <strong>other</strong> options, &mldr;</p></div><p>Determiners have 9 subcategories. Fortunately, 5 of them have already been discussed:</p><ul><li><strong>Definite article:</strong> <em>the</em></li><li><strong>Indefinite article:</strong> <em>a, an</em></li><li><strong>Possessive determiners:</strong> <em>my, your, his, her, its, our, their</em></li><li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> <em>a few, a little, much, many, most, some, any, enough, a lot of</em></li><li><strong>Numbers</strong>: <em>zero, one, two, three, four, &mldr;</em></li></ul><p>The others are explained in this article.</p><h2 id=demonstratives>Demonstratives</h2><p>Demonstratives have two separate functions:</p><ul><li>Referring to a noun mentioned earlier (in the sentence or paragraph).</li><li>Showing placement or position of something.</li></ul><p>They are placed before the noun. If the noun was mentioned previously, they can be used <em>on their own</em>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>-</th><th>Close by (&ldquo;here&rdquo;)</th><th>Far away (&ldquo;there&rdquo;)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Singular & Uncountable</em></td><td>This</td><td>That</td></tr><tr><td><em>Plural</em></td><td>These</td><td>Those</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>&ldquo;<strong>This</strong> book is really good.&rdquo; (Probably holding the book in your hand, or it&rsquo;s really close.)</li><li>&ldquo;Are your shoes new? I like <strong>those</strong> colors!&rdquo; (Pointing to their shoes; far away.)</li><li>&ldquo;What are <strong>these</strong> black spots in my food!?&rdquo; (The food is right in front of you; close by)</li><li>&ldquo;I know you lied. <strong>This</strong> isn&rsquo;t about <strong>that</strong>.&rdquo; (They stand on their own; refer to the previous sentence.)</li></ul></div><p>Use &ldquo;close by&rdquo; if you could hold something in your hand, and &ldquo;far away&rdquo; if you would point to it instead. With abstract concepts&mdash;not something in the real world&mdash;you can choose what to use.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Using demonstratives to show position.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=demonstratives.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Using demonstratives to show position." title="Using demonstratives to show position." width=950 height=454></picture></figure></p><p>Even when <em>referring</em>, you still follow the <em>close by/far away</em> rules. If you <em>just</em> mentioned something, it is &ldquo;close by&rdquo;. If you mentioned something further back, or something more abstract, it is &ldquo;far away&rdquo;.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I like birds very much. It&rsquo;s this obsession that keeps me awake at night.&rdquo;</p><p>The obsession is of the speaker himself, so very close to him: <strong>this</strong>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He is more into lions. That&rsquo;s no problem, they are cool too.&rdquo;</p><p>His obsession is away from the speaker, so <strong>that</strong>.</p></div><h2 id=numbers>Numbers</h2><p>Numbers are placed before the noun. The noun, of course, needs to be in plural form if the number is higher than one. I already gave the table of numbers at <a href=../nouns-counting/>Nouns: counting</a>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I would like <strong>one</strong> burger and <strong>two</strong> smoothie<strong>s</strong>.</p></div><p>But those are just the numbers on their own. You probably know numbers are more important than that.</p><p>They can be used in some other ways, which require extra rules.</p><h3 id=ranking>Ranking</h3><p>The <em>ranking numbers</em> are used to show that something is in a certain order. For example, when you play a competition, people are ranked based on how well they did. Somebody will <em>win</em> and come <em>first</em>. Someone else comes <em>second</em>. And so forth.</p><p>The first three ranking numbers are irregular. (Hopefully you see this pattern: the more common and useful a part of English is, the more likely it is <em>irregular</em>.)</p><ul><li>1st = First</li><li>2nd = Second</li><li>3rd = Third</li></ul><p>After that, you form ranking numbers with: <strong>number</strong> + <strong>-th</strong>.</p><ul><li>4th = Fourth</li><li>5th = Fifth</li><li>10th = Tenth</li><li>20th = Twentieth</li><li>100th = Hundredth</li></ul><p>As you can see, sometimes the number is <em>slightly</em> changed to make the ending easier to read. (It&rsquo;s fifth, <strong>not</strong> fiveth.) There is no clear rule for this: you will learn the special cases over time.</p><h3 id=more-difficult-numbers>More difficult numbers</h3><p>All numbers so far were nice. They were &ldquo;whole numbers&rdquo; or &ldquo;integers&rdquo;.</p><p>What if we want to write a <em>fraction</em>, like 3/4? Or 1/3?</p><p>Use this construction: <strong>numerator</strong> (first number) + <strong>denominator as rank</strong> (second numer).</p><p>If the numerator is greater than 1, it means we have <em>multiple pieces</em> of the fraction. So the denominator becomes plural and gets an extra <strong>"-s"</strong></p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>1/3 = One third</li><li>2/3 = Two third<strong>s</strong></li><li>4/5 = Four fifths</li></ul></div><p>But we can go even further. How do we say 3.5? Or 6.29? Or any number with a dot and some <em>decimals</em> behind it?</p><p>In this case, we call that dot a <strong>point</strong>. And then we simply write all the numbers, one by one, in full.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>0.6632 => point six six three two</p></div><h3 id=zero-is-special>Zero is special</h3><p>Zero has always been a special number. It, therefore, has four ways to say it:</p><ul><li><strong>Zero</strong> if within a regular number</li><li><strong>O</strong> (just the letter <em>o</em>) when part of a <em>year</em>, <em>address</em>, <em>time</em> or <em>temperature</em></li><li><strong>Nil</strong> when reporting (sports) scores</li><li><strong>Nought</strong> used in scientific formulas and descriptions. Not used in the USA.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>The soccer game ended two to nil.</li><li>The summer of 1902 (nineteen-o-two) was strange.</li><li>If we add a<sub>0</sub> (a-nought) and b<sub>0</sub> (b-nought), we get &mldr;</li></ul></div><h2 id=distributives>Distributives</h2><p>These <em>distribute</em> a noun among a group. In other words, they say <em>what part of the group</em> applies to the sentence.</p><p>It has four different types:</p><ul><li><strong>Each</strong> and <strong>every</strong>: all members of a group, as individuals => <em>Each of them wanted a piece of cake.</em></li><li><strong>All:</strong> the group as a whole => <em>All employees thought the company was doing well.</em></li><li><strong>Half:</strong> only 50% of the group => <em>Half of the citizens were against the proposal</em>.</li><li><strong>Both, either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>: when talking about two groups or a pair => <em>Both parties agreed te the contract. You and I, we both like the same things.</em></li></ul><h2 id=difference-words>Difference Words</h2><p>These point out that two things are <em>different</em>. This means something must come before it. You must mention a certain group, and then, in a later sentence, you can point to <em>a different group</em> with these words.</p><p>It has only three variants:</p><ul><li><strong>Another:</strong> for singular countable nouns. => <em>Another week went by, this time without another attack.</em></li><li><strong>Other:</strong> for the rest of the singular nouns => <em>Other people think you are a liar.</em></li><li><strong>Others:</strong> for plural nouns => <em>I will ask the others what they think.</em></li></ul><h2 id=pre-determiners>Pre-Determiners</h2><p>These are placed before an adjective to modify it.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Yes, the adjective modifies the noun, and a pre-determiner modifies the adjective. Language is all about modifying the basic building blocks that you have.</p></div><p>Place them before the <strong>article</strong> (a/an/the). These are very <em>vague</em> and are mostly decoration, or to show an opinion. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>Such</strong> and <strong>what</strong>: to express surprise or other emotions.</li><li><strong>Rather</strong> and <strong>quite:</strong> slightly intensifies the adjective. Can be positive or negative; that depends on the adjective itself.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li><strong>What</strong> a lovely dress!</li><li>We&rsquo;ve had <strong>such</strong> a good time in the cinema.</li><li>That&rsquo;s <strong>quite</strong> a lovely dress.</li><li>He is <strong>rather</strong> angry about the decision.</li></ul></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Most of these words are not that essential. You could get by without them. But they <em>shorten</em> many sentences and simplify referencing things. They also add <em>flair</em> and <em>decoration</em> to your communication.</p><p>It feels better to hear &ldquo;You are <em>such</em> a good listener&rdquo;. Instead of just &ldquo;You are a good listener&rdquo;.</p><p>It reads better to say &ldquo;I am against the idea, but the <em>others</em> might like it&rdquo;. Instead of &ldquo;I am against the idea, but <em>the members of the group excluding myself</em> might like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Use these words for that purpose.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/adverbs/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Adverbs</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/cheat-sheet/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Cheat Sheet</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["Word placed before specific nouns","Word placed before a singular noun","Word used to show a noun belongs to a pronoun","Word used to count (without numbers)","Word used to show something is in a specific order","Word used to reference earlier nouns; or show physical placement","Word used to say to what part of a group a noun applies","Word used to indicate an alternative to something mentioned before","Word used to modify adjectives, instead of nouns",'Word placed before "not"',"Word placed before pronouns","Word placed in the heading of an article","Word used when giving instructions or showing how something needs to be done"],terms:["Definite Article","Indefinite Article","Possessive Determiners","Quantifiers","Ranks","Demonstratives","Distributives","Difference Words","Pre-Determiners"],type:"terms"},{blanks:["tables are sturdy","phone looks expensive","birds are fast","day goes by","member knows the password","place wins 1,000 dollars","place wins 100 dollars","nice weather today"],options:[["These","This","That","One"],["That","These","A few"],["Those","That","Another"],["Another","Other","Some","These"],["Each","All","Some","Those"],["First","Oneth","Secondth","Fourd"],["Second","Twoth","Thirth","Firsth","Fifed"],["Such","All","That","Every","One"]],sentence:"$B $1",type:"blanks"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
