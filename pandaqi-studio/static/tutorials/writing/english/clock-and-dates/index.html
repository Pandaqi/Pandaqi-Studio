You know what that means by now: <em>irregularity</em>.</p><p>The way English talks about dates and time, for example, is completely dissimilar to how my own language (Dutch) talks about it. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to do an article on it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important and ubiquitous. But you won&rsquo;t quickly grasp it by reading random English text.</p><h2 id=time-display>Time display</h2><p>Because of the digital age, most people are now used to 24-hour clocks.</p><p>These are written as: <strong>hours:minutes</strong> The hours go from 00-24. The minutes from 00-60.</p><p>English, however, commonly divides the day into two halves of 12 hours.</p><ul><li>The first half is called &ldquo;AM&rdquo;: after midnight.</li><li>The second half is called &ldquo;PM&rdquo;: pre midnight, or <em>before midnight</em></li></ul><p>Midnight is the point at which the new day starts. So it isn&rsquo;t that strange to use it as the division point.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>13:56 would be 1:56 PM.</li><li>08:29 would be 08:29 AM.</li><li>22:12 would be 10:12 PM</li></ul></div><h2 id=times-of-day>Times of day</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of what each time of day is called.</p><ul><li>Anything until around 12:00 is <em>morning</em>.

When the sun goes down again, it&rsquo;s called <em>dusk</em> or <em>sunset</em>.</p><h2 id=clock>Clock</h2><p>To communicate this time, you can simply say it out loud. &ldquo;05:30 PM&rdquo; is &ldquo;five thirty PM&rdquo;.</p><p>But that often isn&rsquo;t ideal. Especially when working with a <em>physical clock</em>, we switch to a different method.</p><p>Full hours are called <strong>&lt;hour> o&rsquo;clock</strong>. This is an abbreviation of &ldquo;on the clock&rdquo;.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>It&rsquo;s 5 o&rsquo;clock.
