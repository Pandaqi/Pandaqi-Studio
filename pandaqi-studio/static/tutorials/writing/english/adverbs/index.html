They can be <em>formed</em> out of anything and <em>applied</em> to nearly everything. They are the last piece of our puzzle. The last question to answer.</p><ul><li>The subject and object (nouns + adjectives) answer the question <strong>Who?</strong></li><li>The verb answers the question <strong>What?</strong></li><li>Relative clauses usually answer the question <strong>Why?</strong></li></ul><p>Adverbs try to answer the remaining questions: <strong>When?</strong> <strong>Where?</strong> and <strong>How?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Adverbs</strong> modify a verb, adjective or other adverb. They can be a <em>word</em> or a <em>phrase</em>.</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>He lived <strong>happily</strong> ever after.</li><li>She <strong>angrily</strong> threw away her food.</li><li>The test went <strong>very well</strong>.</li></ul></div><p>You can find adverbs by rephrasing a sentence in interrogative form:</p><blockquote><p>Mark loudly sang the beautifully composed song there.</p></blockquote><ul><li>How did Mark sing? <strong>Loudly</strong></li><li>How was the song composed? <strong>Beautifully</strong></li><li>Where did Mark sing? <strong>There</strong></li></ul><p>As you can see, adverbs are everywhere. But they rarely stand on their own in a sentence. They modify what already exists.</p><ul><li>If they modify a verb, they are usually placed after it.</li><li>If they modify an adjective, they are placed in front of it.</li><li>If they are a phrase, it&rsquo;s usually pushed to the end of the sentence</li></ul><h2 id=forming-adverbs>Forming Adverbs</h2><p>Adverbs are constructed from <em>adjectives</em>. So start with an adjective.</p><p>Because adjectives end in all sorts of letters, however, there are <em>many</em> rules for this. Remember that these rules merely exist to make the word easier to read and speak. If a word sounds fine using just the first rule, it&rsquo;s probably fine.</p><p>In most cases, add a <strong>-ly</strong> behind it and you&rsquo;re done.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Quick => Quick<strong>ly</strong></p></div><p>The adjective ends in an <strong>-y</strong>?

By now, you know English likes replacing that &ldquo;y&rdquo; with an &ldquo;i&rdquo; when something comes after it.</p><p>And indeed, you <em>can</em> do that with the <em>comparative</em> and <em>superlative</em> form. Add <strong>-ier</strong> and <strong>-iest</strong> to the end.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She spoke gentlier than him. They sang loudliest of all.</p></div><p>However! This leads to long or clunky words with many syllables. As such, the most common (and better) approach is to use the other rule for comparing: just place <strong>more</strong> and <strong>most</strong> in front.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Slowly => More slowly => Most slowly</p></div><p>Very short adverbs, especially the irregular ones that don&rsquo;t change, are <em>always</em> formed in the usual way:</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Fast => Faster => Fastest</p></div><h2 id=relative-adverbs>Relative Adverbs</h2><p>Adverbs can help glue a short sentence to another one.</p><p>The full way to write this uses <strong>(in/at/on/for) + which</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>A rain storm happened on the day <strong>on which</strong> she was born</li><li>We don&rsquo;t know the reason <strong>for which</strong> he left.</li></ul></div><p>Often, you can shorten such a sentence. Do this with <em>relative adverbs</em>: <strong>where, when</strong> or <strong>why</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>A rain storm happened on the day <strong>when</strong> she was born</li><li>We don&rsquo;t know the reason <strong>why</strong> he left.</li></ul></div><p>If the glue sentence is simple enough, you can leave it out entirely.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>A rain storm happened on the day she was born.</li><li>We don&rsquo;t know the reason he left.</li></ul><p>That last sentence is quite common, but <em>not recommended</em>. It introduces vagueness. &ldquo;The reason he left&rdquo; could also mean that he left behind a note stating a reason. It feels like this sentence misses a word, and it does.</p></div><h2 id=interrogative-adverbs>Interrogative Adverbs</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the big questions: <em>who, what, where, when, why</em> and <em>how</em>.</p><p>Now we can give them a name: <em>interrogative adverbs</em>.</p><ul><li>Place them at the beginning of a sentence.</li><li>Switch the subject and verb</li><li>And you have a question!</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li><strong>How</strong> often do you shave?</li><li><strong>Where</strong> did he suddenly come from?</li><li><strong>What</strong> time is it?</li></ul></div><p>The word <em>how</em> is a bit abstract. There are four typical ways in which it is used:</p><ul><li>When it means <em>in what way.</em> => <em>How do you repair a bike?</em></li><li>To ask about degree/severeness of an adjective => <em>How old do you think he is?</em></li><li>To ask about degree/frequency of an action => <em>How fast did he run!?</em></li><li>With <em>much</em> and <em>many</em> to ask about quantity => <em>How much time did you put into this assignment?</em></li></ul><h2 id=english-remarks-again>English remarks, again</h2><p>Early on, I mentioned the tendency of English to include (opinionated) remarks. Just a tiny word or sentence, surrounded by a comma (<code>,</code>) or dash (<code>–</code>), to give some judgement or viewpoint on a sentence.</p><p>Now we can complete the circle on this. They are <em>commenting adverbs</em>. They come at the start or the end. Sometimes, but rarely, they appear directly around the main verb.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li><strong>Clearly,</strong> she doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talking about. (The writer&rsquo;s opinion is that <em>she</em>, the subject, doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s doing.)</li><li>They are the ones to blame, <strong>obviously</strong> (The writer is so sure of their opinion, that they have to mention it is obvious.)</li><li>He has <strong>undoubtedly</strong> prepared well.</li></ul></div><h2 id=adverbials>Adverbials</h2><p>When an adverb is a <em>phrase</em> or <em>clause</em>, some like to call it an <em>adverbial</em>. (To make this distinction clear.)</p><p>In this case, it has the same function: modify the sentence. But it&rsquo;s a phrase because we simply need <em>multiple words</em> to do so.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He was still sick. => why? => He was still sick <strong>from dinner last Friday</strong>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She played soccer. => When? => She played soccer <strong>when she was young</strong>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>They spoke. => How? => They spoke <strong>in an angry voice</strong>.</p></div><p>You can turn the order around. &ldquo;When she was young, she played soccer.&rdquo; But this isn&rsquo;t recommended. Because it makes the sentence harder to read: the subject + verb now come at the <em>end</em>. They are the most important parts and should be communciated early!</p><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to modify adjectives into adverbs. You&rsquo;ve learned where to place them, when they can shorten a sentence, and when you can omit them altogether.</p><p>All that&rsquo;s left is learning the types of adverbs available. Again, see this as a <em>reference</em>. Don&rsquo;t try to memorize this. Just skip through, come back when you&rsquo;re looking for a specific word to use.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t list all adverbs. (That&rsquo;d be impossible. There are thousands and thousands of them!) It lists the different groups, the common words in them, and where to place them in a sentence.</p><h3 id=adverbs-of-place>Adverbs of Place</h3><p>Most common are <strong>here</strong> (something nearby) and <strong>there</strong> (something far away).</p><p>Those are usually placed at the end of the sentence or after prepositions. When put at the front, they are an exclamation or receive emphasis.</p><p>In the <a href=../pronouns/>Pronouns</a> chapter we also discussed the important <strong>everywhere, anywhere, somewhere</strong> and <strong>nowhere</strong>.</p><p>In the <a href=../prepositions/>Prepositions</a> chapter you already saw them categorized by <em>time</em>, <em>place</em> and <em>movement</em>. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that <strong>some prepositions can be an adverb as well!</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Word</th><th>Used as adverb</th><th>Used as preposition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>around</em></td><td>He came around very often those days.</td><td>It was placed around the hearth.</td></tr><tr><td><em>behind</em></td><td>He was falling behind the others.</td><td>He hid behind the rocks.</td></tr><tr><td><em>down</em></td><td>He fell down.</td><td>She ran down the road.</td></tr><tr><td><em>in</em></td><td>He decided to jump in to save the situation.</td><td>The postman dropped letters in the mailbox.</td></tr><tr><td><em>off</em></td><td>I want to get off at the next stop.</td><td>He fell off the balcony.</td></tr><tr><td><em>on</em></td><td>They cycled on for a few more hours.</td><td>She placed all her books on the table.</td></tr><tr><td><em>over</em></td><td>She turned over twice before falling asleep.</td><td>The picture still hangs over my bed.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It doesn&rsquo;t work in all cases. Adverbs and prepositions are clearly distinct word types. They simply have some overlap in this important area.</p></div><h3 id=adverbs-of-time>Adverbs of Time</h3><p>There are three adverbs of time: <em>how long > how often > when (exactly)</em>.</p><p>If you use multiple, they should always be in that order.</p><p><strong>Time follows place in a sentence</strong>. Unless you intend to emphasize one of them. (Which is used in poems, novels or speeches.) But keep it simple and straightforward otherwise.</p><p><strong>How long:</strong> <em>often, never, always, seldom, rarely, frequently, regularly, usually, once a week, monthly, &mldr;</em></p><p><strong>How often:</strong> <em>all day, for weeks, for years, since Tuesday, &mldr;</em></p><p><strong>When:</strong> <em>yesterday, tomorrow, today, later, now, last year, next year, &mldr;</em></p><p>The word <strong>yet</strong> is used in questions and negative sentences: if something hasn&rsquo;t happened, but is expected to happen.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Have you finished that project <strong>yet</strong>?</p></div><p>The word <strong>still</strong> expresses continuity. It is mostly used in positive sentences. It is placed before the main verb. But if the main verb is an <em>auxiliary verb</em>, it comes <em>after</em> it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>*I still like the same songs.
*He is still in love with you.</p></div><h3 id=adverbs-of-manner>Adverbs of Manner</h3><p>Adverbs of manner tell how something happened. &ldquo;Manner&rdquo; is another word for &ldquo;the way the action happens&rdquo;. Most adverbs that modify a <em>verb</em> fall in this category.</p><p>For example: <em>well, quickly, patiently, greedily, softly, beautifully, angrily, roughly, &mldr;</em></p><p>You can always place an <em>adverb of manner</em> at the end of a sentence, so it modifies the action of the whole sentence.</p><p>But &mldr;</p><ul><li>If the sentence is long, or has many verbs, place the adverb <em>behind the verb to which it applies</em>. This avoids confusion.</li><li>If the sentence has an object (direct or indirect), place the adverb in front of that. Again, to avoid confusion.</li></ul><p>Some adverbs always come immediately after the verb: <em>well, badly, hard</em> and <em>fast</em>.</p><h3 id=adverbs-of-degree>Adverbs of Degree</h3><p>These tell us about the intensity or degree of an action. They are placed directly before whatever they are modifying.</p><p>The adverb <strong>very</strong> makes an adverb or adjective stronger. The word <em>too</em> says there is a problem (things have gone too far). The word <em>very</em> simply states a fact.</p><p><strong>Not very</strong> is used to reverse this: instead of making something stronger, it makes it weaker.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>It was very bad => It wasn&rsquo;t very good</p></div><p>The adverb <strong>too</strong> can have two very different meanings:</p><ul><li>Same as <em>also</em>. Placed at the end => <em>I like swimming <strong>too</strong>!</em></li><li>Same as <em>excessively</em>. Place before what it modifies => <em>Am I <strong>too</strong> fat?</em></li></ul><p>The adverb <strong>enough</strong> comes <em>after</em> what it modifies. It means something like &ldquo;to the necessary degree&rdquo;.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>He didn&rsquo;t do enough to pass the exam.</li><li>But it was enough for me.</li><li>Now I have enough points to get my diploma.</li></ul></div><p>This can also express a quantity: <em>as much/many as necessary</em>.</p><p>It is often followed by <em>for someone</em>, <em>for something</em> or <em>&ldquo;to&rdquo;+infinitive</em>.</p><h3 id=adverbs-of-certainty>Adverbs of Certainty</h3><p>Express how certain we feel about an event or action.</p><ul><li>Always put before the main verb.</li><li>Unless that verb is some form of <strong>to be</strong>.</li></ul><p>These are: <em>certainly, definitely, probably, undoubtedly, surely</em></p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I definitely like pizza.</li><li>You are definitely a hero.</li><li>They will surely find the answer.</li></ul></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/adjectives/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Adjectives</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/determiners/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Determiners</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{general:["She shouted in an angry way","I was quick to go inside","You spoke in a beautiful way","They jumped at the same time a car passed by"],options:[["She shouted angrily","She shouted angryly","It can't be rewritten","She shouted angly"],["I went inside quickly","I went inside quickest","I was inside in a quickly way","I was quickly to go inside"],["You spoke beautifully","You spoke in a beautifully way","A beautiful way, you spoke"],["They jumped when a car passed by","They jumped timely for a car pass by","They jumpily timed a car passing by","It can't be rewritten"]],sentence:"Shorten the sentence using an adverb; $1",type:"general"},{general:["He could play guitar well","She went to the shop","She often went to the shop when she was younger","They easily passed the test","We carry this great burden"],options:[["Yes","No"],["No","Yes"],["Yes","No"],["Yes","No"],["No","Yes"]],sentence:"Does this sentence have an adverb(ial)? $1",type:"general"}]</script></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
