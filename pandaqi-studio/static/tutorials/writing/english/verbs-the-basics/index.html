Hopefully you agree that was time well spent. You know exactly</p><ul><li>How to write the subject (or object) of a sentence</li><li>How to refer to other nouns (<a href=../pronouns/>Pronouns</a>)</li><li>How to glue them together (<a href=../prepositions/>Prepositions</a>).</li></ul><p>Now let&rsquo;s learn the other part of the formula: <em>verbs</em>. The actual thing the subject is <em>doing</em> in the sentence.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Verbs</strong> describe the action of a sentence. They communicate what the subject does.</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-verbs-are-defined>How verbs are defined</h2><p>Verbs consist of a &ldquo;stem&rdquo; or a &ldquo;base&rdquo;. This part of the verb stays the same, while other parts change. The way a verb changes is called a <em>conjugation</em>.</p><p>Why would a verb change?</p><ul><li>To match the <em>subject</em>. (If there are multiple nouns in the sentence &mldr; to which one does the verb belong?)</li><li>To communicate the <em>timing</em> of the action. (Did it happen in the past? Is it a prediction for the future? Is it currently happening?)</li></ul><p>If you look up a verb in the dictionary, you find this base form, with the word <code>to</code> before it. That&rsquo;s called the <strong>infinitive</strong>.</p><p>This version describes the action <em>in general</em>. You might know it from a famous Shakespeare quote &mldr;</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>To be or not to be &mldr; üé≠</p></div><p>It talks about &ldquo;being&rdquo;. The concept of existing. But there&rsquo;s no subject, nobody is <em>doing</em> that existing.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>To think üß†, to see üëÄ, to eat üòã, to hear üëÇ, &mldr;</p></div><p>This syntax is therefore <em>rarely</em> used. (When are <em>you</em> ever talking about the general idea of existing? Or walking? Or eating?)</p><p>But if you replace the <code>to</code> with a subject &mldr; you&rsquo;re suddenly creating sentences!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>To see => I see a cat. (üëÄ üê±)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>To hear => You hear music. (üëÇ üé∂)</p></div><h2 id=subject>Subject</h2><p>The verb changes based on the subject.</p><p><em>Why?</em> To show the connection. If you read a noun, and the verb doesn&rsquo;t match it, you know that noun is <em>not</em> the subject of the sentence!</p><p>English, though, has <em>way</em> simpler rules than other languages. The benefits are reduced, but it&rsquo;s easier to learn.</p><p>The verb stem stays identical for all pronouns. (Both 1<sup>st</sup> person, 2<sup>nd</sup> person, and 3<sup>rd</sup> person.)</p><p>Except for 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular: he / she / it. Then the rules are identical to how you create <em>plural nouns</em>.</p><ul><li>The third person gets an <strong>-s</strong> behind the verb stem.</li><li>But if the verb already ended with an s-like sound, add <strong>-es</strong> instead</li><li>And if the verb ends with an <strong>-y</strong> (with no vowel before it), replace it with <strong>-ies</strong></li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I see a cat => He see<strong>s</strong> a cat.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You carry books => She carr<strong>ies</strong> books.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We see a cat. They carry books. It feel<strong>s</strong> strange.</p></div><h2 id=time>Time</h2><p>Actions are closely linked to time. An action might already have been completed. Or it&rsquo;s currently going on. Or you might say you are <em>going to</em> do something in the <em>future</em>.</p><p>All these different formats are called <strong>verb tenses</strong>.</p><p>All examples so far have used the easiest and most used tense: <strong>simple present</strong>.</p><p>Its syntax is indeed <em>simple</em>. And it happens in the <em>present</em>, so not in the past or future. But its <em>meaning</em> is often misunderstood. You will understand this once we get to that chapter.</p><p>The other tenses are <em>equally simple</em>. They only need slight changes to the verb stem. English has a very regular grammar &mldr; so it must <em>compensate</em> somehow.</p><p>It uses <strong>auxiliary verbs</strong> to do that. Those are &ldquo;helper verbs&rdquo; added to other verbs to change their meaning. These are very important&mdash;and also very irregular and tough to memorize.</p><p>So let&rsquo;s take a break here. Next chapter will tell you all about them!</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/prepositions/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Prepositions</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-helpers/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Verbs: helpers</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["A different way to write a verb, so it matches the sentence","A timing in which a sentence can be","The basic form of a verb, found in the dictionary","Combining multiple verbs","Actions talking about infinity","Verbs that add tension to a sentence","A verb that never changes"],terms:["Conjugation","Tense","Infinitive"],type:"terms"},{blanks:["I","You","He","He","They"],options:[["see","sees","see's"],["see","sees","see's"],["sees","see","see's"],["carries","carry","carrys"],["carry","carrys","carrs","carrie"]],sentence:"$1 $B a book",type:"blanks"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
