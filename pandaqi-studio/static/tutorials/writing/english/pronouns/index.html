This means they are still <em>nouns</em>. But they are part of a special group that follows the same rules. They are used very often, because they make your communication shorter and more direct.</p><p>Why? As the name &ldquo;pro&rdquo; implies, it <em>replaces</em> an existing noun. You take out a longer word and replace it with the short pronoun that refers to it.</p><p>This does mean that the pronoun <em>changes</em> based on what it refers to. There&rsquo;s no other way to learn these than reading and writing a lot, until you know all the variations.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Pronouns</strong> replace nouns. They are shorter words, referring to a noun used earlier. They avoid repetition and shorten sentences. Be careful, though, that it&rsquo;s still obvious <em>what</em> they refer to.</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Long version: &ldquo;Paul saw something in the dark. The thing Paul saw in the dark was Paul&rsquo;s own shadow.&rdquo;</p><p>Pronoun version: &ldquo;Paul saw something in the dark. It was his own shadow.&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=personal-pronouns>Personal pronouns</h2><p>Below is the full table of pronouns. The rest of the article explains what each column means. I give the information at once, so you can see the patterns (to help memorize it), and because its more succinct.</p><p>We distinguish three cases:</p><ul><li><strong>1<sup>st</sup> person:</strong> when referring to yourself</li><li><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> person:</strong> when referring to the person <em>to whom</em> you&rsquo;re speaking</li><li><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> person:</strong> when referring to someone (or something) else not in the conversation</li></ul><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visual of what 1st, 2nd and 3rd person means, both singular and plural</span></figcaption><picture><img src=first_second_third_person.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visual of what 1st, 2nd and 3rd person means, both singular and plural" title="Visual of what 1st, 2nd and 3rd person means, both singular and plural" width=950 height=454></picture></figure></p><p>This system is present in every language. Though many languages have some overlap. In this case, the 2<sup>nd</sup> person <em>singular</em> and <em>plural</em> are almost identical.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>French is the same. In Dutch, the 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular female and plural are identical.</p></div><h3 id=singular>Singular</h3><table><thead><tr><th>-</th><th>Subject</th><th>Object</th><th>Reflexive</th><th>Possessive</th><th>Possessive Adjective</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1<sup>st</sup></td><td>I</td><td>me</td><td>myself</td><td>my</td><td>mine</td></tr><tr><td>2<sup>nd</sup></td><td>you</td><td>you</td><td>yourself</td><td>yours</td><td>your</td></tr><tr><td>3<sup>rd</sup> male</td><td>he</td><td>him</td><td>himself</td><td>his</td><td>his</td></tr><tr><td>3<sup>rd</sup> female</td><td>she</td><td>her</td><td>herself</td><td>hers</td><td>her</td></tr><tr><td>3<sup>rd</sup> neutral</td><td>it</td><td>it</td><td>itself</td><td></td><td>its</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Mark is a liar. <strong>He</strong> keeps breaking promises.</p><p>My dog is a cutie. <strong>It</strong> happily runs to me whenever I get home.</p><p>This laptop is broken. <strong>It</strong> just won&rsquo;t work!</p></div><h3 id=plural>Plural</h3><table><thead><tr><th>-</th><th>Subject</th><th>Object</th><th>Reflexive</th><th>Possessive</th><th>Possessive Adjective</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1<sup>st</sup> person</td><td>we</td><td>us</td><td>ourselves</td><td>ours</td><td>our</td></tr><tr><td>2<sup>nd</sup> person</td><td>you</td><td>you</td><td>yourselves</td><td>yours</td><td>your</td></tr><tr><td>3<sup>rd</sup> person</td><td>they</td><td>them</td><td>themselves</td><td>theirs</td><td>their</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My friends are amazing. <strong>They</strong> organized a surprise party!</p><p>It&rsquo;s too expensive for my family. <strong>We</strong> cannot afford it.</p><p>Facebook keeps changing their policies. <strong>They</strong> should figure it out for once!</p></div><h3 id=humans-vs-the-rest>Humans vs the rest</h3><p>This system probably developed, again, because our sentences need a subject and a verb. Most <em>actions</em> that happen, do so because a <em>person</em> does them. So we developed a system where you can specifically refer to all sorts of people. (And groups of people.)</p><p>Any actions taken by non-humans will use the 3<sup>rd</sup> person neutral form (<code>it</code>).</p><p>Over time, the 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural (<code>they</code>) therefore developed into a neutral form for <em>everything</em>.</p><p>In English, you can refer to anything with &ldquo;they&rdquo; and it will sound fine. But I still recommend being more specific with your language, where possible.</p><p>Gender is often used to express a special bond with a non-human subject. Us&mdash;weird humans&mdash;really like putting our own humanity into everything, I guess ðŸ™ƒ</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>This is my boat.

The man gave a book to <strong>her</strong>.</p></div><h2 id=reflexive-pronouns>Reflexive Pronouns</h2><p>It has two types: <em>reflexive</em> and <em>intensive</em>. They use the same word, though their function is different.</p><p><strong>Reflexive</strong> pronouns are used if the <em>object</em> is the same as the <em>subject</em>. You&rsquo;re reflecting on something you did to yourself!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She hit <strong>herself</strong> with a tennis racket. We blame <strong>ourselves</strong> for the failure.</p></div><p><strong>Intensive</strong> pronouns are used if you want to <em>intensify</em> the subject of the sentence. They stress the importance of the subject&mdash;they repeat it. But it can be removed or left out without changing the meaning of the sentence.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I baked these cakes <strong>myself</strong>. They <strong>themselves</strong> told me what I did was fine.</p></div><h2 id=possessive-adjectives>Possessive Adjectives</h2><p>These pronouns provide an alternative for showing a possessive relationship between two nouns. This method is usually shorter.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Jack went to Jack&rsquo;s house (long!) => Jack went to <strong>his</strong> house (short!)</p></div><p>They are placed <strong>before</strong> the noun to which they belong. Remember that these <em>don&rsquo;t</em> follow the rules of possessive form. They already show possession on their own.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>The dog broke <strong>its</strong> leg.</li><li>They went to <strong>their</strong> school.</li><li>I can&rsquo;t find <strong>my</strong> shoes.</li></ul></div><h2 id=possessive-pronouns>Possessive Pronouns</h2><p>These are also possesive. But use them <strong>after</strong> the noun to which it belongs.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Long version: &ldquo;Jack was a nice guy. This house was Jack&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p><p>Short version: &ldquo;Jack was a nice guy. This house was <strong>his</strong>.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The candy was <strong>mine</strong>. The book was <strong>hers</strong>.</p></div><p><em>Why after the noun?</em> This stresses the importance of the word. Look at the sentence above. &ldquo;The candy was mine&rdquo; is not about the candy, it&rsquo;s about the fact it is <em>your</em> candy. By placing it after the noun, <em>who</em> possesses it becomes more important than the noun itself.</p><p>The other type (<em>possessive adjectives</em>) is more common though. It&rsquo;s also how most people expect a possession to be expressed.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/nouns-possessive/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Nouns: Possessive</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/indefinite-pronouns/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Indefinite Pronouns</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["Word that prevents repetition of a noun by replacing it with something shorter","Word used when it's the subject of a sentence","Word used when it's the object of a sentence","Word used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same","Word used to show a noun belongs to another noun","Word used to replace a noun that is a physical object","Word used for actions that involve mirrors","Word used before a noun to make it stronger"],terms:["Pronoun","Subject pronoun","Object pronoun","Reflexive pronoun","Possessive pronoun"],type:"terms"},{general:["Jack has a computer","We have a deal","I won an award"],options:[["his computer","him computer","he computer","himself computer"],["our deal","we deal","us deal","ours deal"],["an award of mine","an award my","an my award","an award myself"]],sentence:"Pick the right option. $1, it is ...",type:"general"},{general:["I hit yourself","Don't talk to we like that!","Them read your books","She stopped herself"],options:[["no, use 'you'","no, use 'yours'","yes"],["no, use 'us'","no, use 'ours'","yes"],["no, use 'they'","no, use 'yours'","no, use 'their'","yes"],["yes","no, use 'hers'","no, use 'her'"]],sentence:"Is this sentence correct? $1",type:"general"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
