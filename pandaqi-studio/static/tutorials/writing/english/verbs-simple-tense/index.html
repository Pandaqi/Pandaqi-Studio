I don&rsquo;t like that approach. Verbs are easier to learn when grouped by <em>type</em>.</p><p>Why? The reason verb tenses are put in the same group (by name), is because they <em>are</em> almost the same. Both functionally ( = what they do) and syntactically ( = how to write them).</p><p>Each of the next chapters will, therefore, explain one group of verb tenses with the same name.</p><ul><li>Simple</li><li>Continuous</li><li>Perfect</li><li>Conditional</li><li>Gerund & Participle</li><li>Infinitive</li><li>(Passive Voice)</li></ul><p>Within most groups exist three variants. One for for each timing: present, past and future.</p><p>This first chapter is about the one you already know: <em>simple present</em>. It&rsquo;s part of the <em>simple tenses</em>. The chapters after it follow the same structure: introduce a tense, then give the three variants for it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Simple</strong> tense is for <em>starting</em> actions. (Which could also mean a general truth or habit you&rsquo;ll likely start or have started.)</p></blockquote><h2 id=why-simple>Why &ldquo;simple&rdquo;?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s called that way because it is the simplest of them all when it comes to <strong>grammar</strong>.</p><p>When it comes to <strong>meaning</strong>, though, there are some caveats. Every tense in English has some specific differences that you should know and understand. It&rsquo;s easy to write a sentence that <em>sounds</em> right, but is actually the wrong tense for what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p><p>Simple tenses describe general or repeatable truths. Like appointments, repeated actions/habits, instructions, etcetera.</p><p>The simple tense does <strong>not</strong> describe actions while they are happening. The &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; tense does that, as the name implies.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I work as a nurse (üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è) => this is a general truth about your job; you&rsquo;re not necessarily <em>currently at work, being a nurse</em></p><p>I am working, don&rsquo;t bother me! => this is a different tense; you are <em>currently doing that work action</em></p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>This tutorial is almost entirely written in the present simple. Because it contains many general truths and instructions on how to write English.</p></div><h2 id=about-sentences-and-time>About sentences and time</h2><p>The time of a sentence is really important. That&rsquo;s why verbs have so many variations: to convey all different ways an action can happen over time.</p><p>At the same time, we only have two ways to indicate time: <strong>verb</strong> and <strong>time nouns</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I am sad on Mondays (üò•) => the part &ldquo;on Mondays&rdquo; indicates the time this sentence talks about</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I will jump to the other side (ü¶ò) => the verb <strong>will</strong> indicates this is future tense, so the time of the sentence is somewhere in the future</p></div><p>When choosing the right tense for your sentence, you need to ask yourself: &ldquo;in what <em>time</em> is this sentence situated?&rdquo;</p><p>For example, if a sentence starts with &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo;, now the <em>whole sentence</em> happens at that point in time. The reader knows: &ldquo;everything in this sentence is in the past, and takes place <em>yesterday</em>&rdquo;</p><p>Try to view tenses this way. It&rsquo;s not about modifying only a <em>verb</em>. It&rsquo;s about the time of the <em>whole sentence</em>. The verbs and nouns should <em>match</em> each other with their timing.</p><p>Keep this in mind. It will help solve many issues.</p><h2 id=simple-present>Simple Present</h2><p>You&rsquo;ve already learned how to construct the simple present. Use the verb stem (infinitive without <code>to</code>) for everyone. For third person singular, add an <strong>"-s"</strong> (like making nouns plural).</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I <strong>work</strong> in Manchester. (üßë‚Äçüíº)</li><li>The exam <strong>starts</strong> at 10 AM. (üìòüïô)</li><li>They <strong>try</strong> to build a synagogue. (üèóÔ∏èüïç)</li><li>When you <strong>come</strong> home, there will be food in the fridge. (üè†, üßÜ)</li></ul></div><p>It&rsquo;s used for:</p><ul><li>General truths: unchanging situations, emotions, or wishes</li><li>Giving instructions or directions</li><li>Repeatable truths: habits and repeated actions</li><li>Expressing fixed arrangements/appointments in the present or future.</li><li>Expressing a future time. (Only after specific words: <em>after, before, as soon as, until, when</em>.)</li></ul><h2 id=simple-past>Simple Past</h2><p>For this, we need to change the verb stem to its &ldquo;past&rdquo; form.</p><ul><li>Add <strong>"-ed"</strong> to the end</li><li>If the verb already ends in <strong>"-e"</strong>, only add a <strong>"-d"</strong></li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Her mother <strong>died</strong> last year. (To die => died)</li><li>We <strong>lived</strong> in Canada in 1985. (To live => lived)</li><li>They <strong>talked</strong> about it yesterday. (To talk => talked)</li></ul></div><p>It&rsquo;s used for:</p><ul><li>Something that happened frequently in the past. (<em>She often walked home alone.</em>)</li><li>A definite point in time. (<em>They made the arrangements last week</em>)</li><li>An indefinite point in time. (<em>We decided against it long ago</em>)</li></ul><p>The &ldquo;point in time&rdquo; is important. Even when indefinite, the sentence still happens at a fixed point in time. &ldquo;We decided against it long ago&rdquo;, means the whole sentence is put into the time period of &ldquo;long ago&rdquo;.</p><p>This is different than a sentence with <em>no</em> time indication at all. (&ldquo;We have decided against it&rdquo;: the decision has already been made in the past, but when? Never said. That&rsquo;s a different tense.)</p><p>Remember the chapter about modal verbs and contractions! If a modal verb is present, you should put <em>the modal verb</em> into its past form, but the main verb stays normal.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Her mother <strong>didn&rsquo;t die</strong> last year.</li><li>We <strong>didn&rsquo;t live</strong> in Canada in 1985</li></ul></div><h2 id=irregular-verbs>Irregular verbs</h2><p>Earlier, you learned how to write auxiliary verbs in the past. And they didn&rsquo;t follow the rule above. They were different all the time.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I am happy => I was happy (‚ùå I amed happy)</li><li>They do the work => They did the work (‚ùå They doed the work)</li><li>We have a chance => We had a chance (‚ùå We haved a chance)</li></ul></div><p>This is called an &ldquo;irregular verb&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t follow the regular rules. Almost every language has them.</p><p>Why? These are some of the earliest verbs. Used in almost every sentence, used for very common day-to-day tasks and expressions. Their tenses evolved <em>before</em> regular grammar rules.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>You might compare it to the <em>irregular nouns</em>. Those that don&rsquo;t follow the normal rules when they become plural: mouse => mice, man => men, tooth => teeth.</p></div><p>This irregularity only happens for the past. Because that is the tense where the verb is actually <em>modified</em> (by placing that <strong>-ed</strong> after it). Many other tenses use those auxiliary verbs, which means the main verb needs no changing.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll learn these by reading English a lot. Below are common ones:</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I speak English => I <strong>spoke</strong> English when I was at university</li><li>We eat dinner => We <strong>ate</strong> dinner last night</li><li>She holds flowers => She <strong>held</strong> flowers</li><li>I fall down => I <strong>fell</strong> down</li><li>They drink too much => They <strong>drank</strong> too much</li></ul></div><p>In general, they are shorter than regular past verbs. They usually only change one <em>vowel</em> in the verb, or switch two letters around.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Languages slowly lose these irregular verbs. I think that&rsquo;s a shame. If possible, use them. Because they are short and clear, and add variety to the language. It <em>is</em> possible for regular verbs to become irregular over time, but quite rare.</p></div><h2 id=simple-future>Simple Future</h2><p>In the simple future, the verb stays in regular form for all people. Instead, place the auxiliary verb <strong>will</strong> before it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>He will never agree.</li><li>Will you marry me?</li><li>It will rain tomorrow</li><li>They&rsquo;ll give you a ticket.</li><li>She won&rsquo;t be happy with that news.</li></ul></div><p>It&rsquo;s used to:</p><ul><li>Predict a future event.</li><li>Express a spontaneous decision. (<em>I will become a programmer!</em>)</li><li>Express willingness. (Or unwillingness, when negated.)</li><li>Give orders, when addressing someone or a group directly (with
<strong>you</strong>).</li><li>Give an invitation, with <strong>you</strong> in interrogative form ( = a question).</li><li>Make an offer, suggest something or ask for advice/instructions. (It&rsquo;s preferred to use <strong>shall</strong> then: <em>Shall I buy a rose for you?</em>)</li></ul><p>The future usage is easy to understand. But why the other uses? Why is this used to &ldquo;give orders&rdquo;? It is, again, a bit of passive-agressive English language.</p><p>By saying &ldquo;you <em>will</em> go home now and grab your jacket&rdquo;, you are saying:</p><ul><li>I am so certain you follow my commands</li><li>That this will indeed happen in the near future</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s an undertone of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you dare make my future prediction wrong; so obey me&rdquo;</p><p>You should view this tense in that light. Same for the spontaneous decision: you feel good and confident that this statement will become true in the future. That&rsquo;s when you use this tense. (<em>I will start eating better and lose weight!</em>)</p><h2 id=questions>Questions</h2><p>When asking questions, you&rsquo;ll use the simple tense <em>most</em> of the time.</p><p><em>Why?</em> Let&rsquo;s say someone is doing something right now. You can see that happening. It is right in front of you, in the present. Why would you need to ask a question about it?</p><p>Questions are likely not about that, but about those general truths, concepts or habits. Hence, the simple tense is used.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Do you play soccer? => Doesn&rsquo;t ask if the other is playing soccer <em>right now</em>. Asks if they regularly practice the sport.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Are you playing soccer? => <em>This</em> asks if the other is playing soccer <em>right now</em>. It uses the continuous tense, so let&rsquo;s learn that now!</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-contractions/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Verbs: contractions</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-continous-tense/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Verbs: continuous tense</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["A tense for general truths or habits in the now; or planned events","A tense for actions that happened before now, at an (in)definite point","A tense for actions that will happen later; or an instruction, invitation or suggestion","Verbs that don't follow the default rules for specific tenses","Verbs that follow the default rules for specific tenses","A tense for giving something to someone else","A tense used for predicting the future","A tense for when the outcome of an action is already known","A tense used for when the outcome of an action is simple to understand"],terms:["Simple Present","Simple Past","Simple Future","Irregular verbs"],type:"terms"},{general:["I work at the bakery","They eat dinner","We feel sick"],options:[["I worked at the bakery","I works at the bakery","I will work at the bakery"],["They ate dinner","They eated dinner","They eat dinner","They'll eat dinner"],["We felt sick","We feels sick","We feeled sick"]],sentence:"Turn this sentence into the past; $1",type:"general"},{general:["You have a diploma","She sees the monkeys at the zoo","You are all late!"],options:[["You will have a diploma","You had a diploma","You haven't a diploma"],["She will see the monkeys at the zoo","She saw the monkeys at the zoo","She can see the monkeys at the zoo"],["You will all be late!","You were all late!","You will all late!"]],sentence:"Turn this sentence into the future; $1",type:"general"}]</script></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
