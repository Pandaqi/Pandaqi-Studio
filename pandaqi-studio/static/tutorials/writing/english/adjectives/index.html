You have learned all about the two basic blocks of English language: <em>nouns</em> and <em>verbs</em>. You should be able to read and write any basic sentence&mdash;with any time or intention.</p><p>At the very start, though, I also mentioned two advanced concepts. Something I called &ldquo;modifiers&rdquo; that can change what a word means and give more detail.</p><p>You could say: &ldquo;Two girls walk down the street. One finds a wallet.&rdquo;</p><p>But then we&rsquo;d all be wondering: what do the girls look like? Which of them finds the wallet? How can we distinguish them? What does the street look like? Where are they?</p><p>Adjectives help <em>specify</em> nouns by adding detail. Like: &ldquo;A <strong>short</strong> and a <strong>tall</strong> girl walk down <strong>main</strong> street. The tall one finds a <strong>green</strong> wallet.&rdquo;</p><p>There are two big groups of modifiers:</p><ul><li>Adjectives: change <em>nouns</em></li><li>Adverbs: change <em>verbs</em></li></ul><p>This chapter and the next will discuss both. Let&rsquo;s start with adjactives.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Adjectives</strong> modify or describe nouns</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Red 🔴, green 🟢, sleepy 💤, loud 📢, forbidden ⛔, bright 🔆, hot 🌡️, boring, beautiful, tall, short, nice, friendly, best, great, &mldr;</p></div><h2 id=placement>Placement</h2><p>There are two ways to place adjectives:</p><ul><li><strong>Before the noun</strong>: Yesterday, I placed a <em>small</em> table in my <em>big</em> house.</li><li><strong>After verbs of being or perception:</strong> My house is <em>big</em>. The table seems <em>small</em>. The room <em>feels</em> cramped.</li></ul><p>Adjectives don&rsquo;t change their form based on the gender or number (singular/plural) of the noun to which they belong. They always stay the same.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Yes, we&rsquo;ve seen those verbs of being and perception many times now. They are a special class of verbs that allow these special grammar constructions, which are short and useful. In many cases, a rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to all verbs, but only this specific class.</p></div><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The adjectives <em>involved, present</em> and <em>concerned</em> can appear behind the noun. But that changes their meaning.</p></div><h2 id=comparing>Comparing</h2><p>Humans love to compare. We&rsquo;re simply very good at comparing and recognizing patterns. As such, grammar for comparisons is available in nearly any language.</p><p>Comparisons are written based on their result. They can be <em>equal</em>, <em>different</em> (&ldquo;unequal&rdquo;), or have one <em>clear winner</em>.</p><p>This is the <em>only</em> situation in which an adjective changes how its written. Namely, we need the <em>comparative</em> and <em>superlative</em> version. (Those are explained below.)</p><ul><li>Equal; <strong>as + adjective + as</strong> => <em>Jack is as tall as Jim</em></li><li>Unequal; <strong>not as + adjective + as</strong> => <em>Jack is not as tall as Jim</em></li><li>Unequal; <strong>less + adjective + than</strong> => <em>Jack is less tall than Jim</em></li><li>Unequal; <strong>comparative adjective + than</strong> => <em>Jack is taller than Jim</em></li><li>Clear winner; <strong>the + superlative adjective</strong> =><em>Jack is the tallest of the two.</em></li></ul><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Using the comparative and superlative adjective on giraffes</span></figcaption><picture><img src=comparative_superlative.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Using the comparative and superlative adjective on giraffes" title="Using the comparative and superlative adjective on giraffes" width=950 height=253></picture></figure></p><h2 id=comparative--superlative>Comparative & Superlative</h2><p>How do you form this special adjective syntax? It depends on the number of syllables in a word.</p><h3 id=one-syllable>One syllable</h3><p>Add <strong>-er</strong> for comparative and <strong>-est</strong> for superlative.</p><p>If the adjective ends with a <em>single vowel + consonant</em>, you need to double the consonant.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Tall (🦒) => Tall<strong>er</strong> (🦒🦒) => Tall<strong>est</strong> (🦒🦒🦒)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Sad (😥) => Sad<strong>d</strong>er (😥😥) => Sad<strong>d</strong>est (😥😥😥)</p></div><h3 id=two-syllables>Two syllables</h3><p>Some of these use the same pattern as above. (Use &ldquo;-er&rdquo; for comparative, &ldquo;-est&rdquo; for superlative.)</p><p>But for some, you&rsquo;ll immediately notice it becomes hard to read or pronounce. In that case, you don&rsquo;t modify the adjective, but place a helper word in front: <strong>more + adjective</strong> for comparative, and <strong>most + adjective</strong> for superlative.</p><p>If you are not sure, you can always play safe and use that system.</p><p>Adjectives ending in <strong>-y</strong> need to replace it with an <strong>-i</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Happy (🤗) => Happier (🤗🤗) => Happiest (🤗🤗🤗)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Tilted => More tilted => Most titled</p></div><h3 id=three-syllables>Three syllables</h3><p>These adjectives always follow the pattern of adding <em>most</em> and <em>more</em> in front. (Changing the adjective to add something would make them <em>too long</em>.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Important => More important => Most important</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Beautiful => More beautiful => Most beautiful</p></div><h3 id=irregular>Irregular</h3><p>Like verbs and nouns, the <em>most important</em> or <em>most common</em> ones are irregular. They don&rsquo;t follow these rules and must be memorized.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Normal Adjective</th><th>Comparative</th><th>Superlative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>good</td><td>better</td><td>best</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>worse</td><td>worst</td></tr><tr><td>little</td><td>less</td><td>least</td></tr><tr><td>much</td><td>more</td><td>most</td></tr><tr><td>far</td><td>further / farther</td><td>furthest / farthest</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=quantities>Quantities</h2><p>At the start of this course, we talked about <em>countable</em> and <em>uncountable nouns</em>.</p><p>If you want to compare <em>quantities</em>, this is important again.</p><table><thead><tr><th>-</th><th>A = B</th><th>A = B</th><th>A > B</th><th>A &lt; B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Countable</em></td><td>many</td><td>few</td><td>more</td><td>fewer</td></tr><tr><td><em>Uncountable</em></td><td>much</td><td>little</td><td>more</td><td>less</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The first &ldquo;A = B&rdquo; is when two nouns are equal and <em>numerous</em>. There are a bunch of them. There&rsquo;s no shortage.</p><p>The second &ldquo;A = B&rdquo; is when two nouns are equal and <em>scarce</em>. They are almost depleted. You don&rsquo;t count many of them.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>There are <strong>as many children</strong> on the playground <strong>as</strong> ants in the world. ( = there were a lot of children there)</li><li>We had <strong>little money</strong> ( = they didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money, money is uncountable)</li><li>He had even <strong>less patience</strong> than Jim.</li><li>They had <strong>fewer points</strong> than the other team.</li></ul></div><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>These days, many people forget that some of these words exist. Everything is &ldquo;less&rdquo;. Less money. Less birds in the tree. Less ideas for my next tutorial. This is <strong>wrong</strong>. Fewer birds in the tree. Fewer ideas. But the mistake is so common, that this is hard to avoid.</p></div><h2 id=multiple-mdjectives>Multiple mdjectives</h2><p>There&rsquo;s no fixed order to follow when using multiple adjectives in a row.</p><p>There is, however, generally accepted order that feels most natural:</p><blockquote><p>Quantity => Value/Opinion => Size => Temperature => Age => Shape => Colour => Origin => Material</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>The two beautiful birds. (🐦🐦)</li><li>The large, cold ice cream. (➕🧊🍦)</li><li>The two ten year olds. (👦👦)</li><li>The rectangular, green box. (🟩)</li><li>The awesome metal car. (🏎️)</li></ul></div><h2 id=on-usage>On usage</h2><p>As you can see, adjectives add more detail and information. But they also increase sentence length and complexity.</p><p>Therefore, do not stuff every sentence with adjectives. Only use them when crucial or quite useful. &ldquo;White snow&rdquo; is just snow. &ldquo;Green grass&rdquo; is also just grass. &ldquo;The old worn damaged book&rdquo; is a bit overkill, one of the adjectives should be enough.</p><p>In some cases, you can find a single <em>noun</em> to replace <em>adjective + noun</em>. A &ldquo;young human&rdquo; is obviously a &ldquo;child&rdquo;. An &ldquo;automated vehicle&rdquo; is a &ldquo;car&rdquo; or &ldquo;automobile&rdquo;.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>In Dutch, this is simply called an &ldquo;auto&rdquo;. For years, as a kid, I thought English used the word &ldquo;auto&rdquo; as well and didn&rsquo;t know what those weird &ldquo;cars&rdquo; were.</p></div><p><em>What if an adjective isn&rsquo;t strong enough?</em> Maybe that isn&rsquo;t just a damaged book. It&rsquo;s almost falling apart!</p><p>To <em>intensify</em> adjectives, you can use words like <strong>very</strong>, <strong>really</strong> or <strong>extremely</strong> in front of them.</p><p>But those are actually &mldr; adverbs! Because you can also use them to intensify verbs.</p><p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that nice, the next chapter is about that.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-passive/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Verbs: passive voice</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/adverbs/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Adverbs</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["Word used to modify or give more detail about a noun","Word combined with nouns into new words","Word used to change what a verb means","Word used for making something more or less extreme"],terms:["Adjective"],type:"terms"},{blanks:["a tree","as her","the group"],options:[["less tall than","taller as","fewer tall than","as tall than"],["as smart as","more smart than","the smartest"],["the oldest of","older as","less older than","oldest than"]],sentence:"I am $B $1",type:"blanks"},{blanks:["money","children","time","food","evidence of his guilt"],options:[["little","few","many"],["many","a","less","little"],["much","many","fewer"],["the best","the goodest","the wellst"],["further","farther","many","few","most"]],sentence:"We have $B $1",type:"blanks"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
