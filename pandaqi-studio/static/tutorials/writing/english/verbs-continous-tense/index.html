It describes an action that is <em>continuing to happen</em>. The simple tense described an action in a general way. The continuous tense clearly states an action that is going on at a clear point in time.</p><p>Use it to describe something that happens at the time of the sentence. Generally, this means describing something that <em>started earlier</em> and is <em>still continuing</em>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Continuous</strong> tense is for <em>ongoing</em> actions. (They started before the time in the sentence, and are still happening now.)</p></blockquote><h2 id=continuous-present>Continuous Present</h2><p>For this, we need to modify the verb again. Grab the verb stem and add <strong>"-ing"</strong> to the end.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Walk => walking, talk => talking, wait => waiting, learn => learning, &mldr;</p></div><p>Now we use the modal verb <strong>to be</strong> in front of it. To negate the sentence, as always, contract the modal verb. And we&rsquo;re done!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>They swim in the lake => they <strong>are swimming</strong> in the lake. (üèä üåä)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I walk&rdquo; states that you have a habit of walking in general. &ldquo;I am walking&rdquo; states you are <em>currently taking a walk</em>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;We eat fish&rdquo; states that fish is in your general diet. &ldquo;I am eating fish&rdquo; states you are <em>currently eating a fish</em>.</p></div><p>It&rsquo;s used to:</p><ul><li>Describe an action that is going on at this moment.</li><li>Describe something that is generally ongoing, like a trend or long-term project. (<em>I&rsquo;m still working on this website of mine</em>)</li><li>Describe an event in the future which is already planned and prepared (<em>I&rsquo;m meeting with my girlfriend tomorrow</em>)</li><li>Describe a temporary event or situation. Something is going on, but it&rsquo;s special, or not generally true. (<em>It&rsquo;s raining now, but the sun should reveal herself at any time.</em>)</li><li>Describe an ongoing series of repeating actions. (These need specific words in front: <em>always, forever</em> or <em>constantly</em> in front => <em>You two are always arguing!</em>)</li></ul><p>Again, these tenses are often about certainty and intention. If you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting with my girlfriend tomorrow&rdquo;, you are quite certain this will happen. It&rsquo;s planned and prepared. You&rsquo;re <em>so</em> certain that you use continuous tense: if we fast-forward to tomorrow, I will be doing this thing, watch me!</p><h3 id=continuous-past>Continuous Past</h3><p>The continuous present is formed using a modal verb (<strong>to be</strong>). This means you already know how to create the past version! Simply put the modal verb into its past form.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>We are walking => We <strong>were</strong> walking</li><li>They are talking => They <strong>were</strong> talking</li><li>I am waiting => I <strong>was</strong> waiting</li></ul></div><p>Use it to describe actions that <em>started</em> and are still going on. Usually, this is used to describe two things at once. Something started and continued, while something <em>else</em> occurred.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The birds <strong>were singing</strong> as the lion woke up. (üê¶üé∂ as ü¶Å ‚è∞)</p></div><p>The main action is the lion waking up. That uses past simple: it happened at a point in the past, he&rsquo;s not still waking up. But the secondary action comes from the birds. They started singing some time ago, and are <em>still doing so</em> as the lion wakes up.</p><p>It can also be used for very polite (or uncertain) requests. Use it in combination with <em>to wonder</em> or <em>to think</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I <strong>was wondering</strong> if you would like to go to the ball with me.</p></div><h3 id=continuous-future>Continuous Future</h3><p>And as expected, the future version uses the modal verb <strong>will</strong>. (For negative sentences, the contraction <strong>won&rsquo;t</strong>.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>She will be sleeping over next Monday.</li><li>They will be dancing at the party next week.</li></ul></div><p>Use it to describe ongoing actions in the future. This is done in two ways:</p><ul><li>Start a completely new action. (<em>I will be learning English tomorrow.</em>)</li><li>Or one that has already started, but won&rsquo;t be finished at that point in the future. In that case, always combine it with the word &ldquo;still&rdquo;. (<em>I will still be learning English the day after that.</em>)</li></ul><p>This tense needs a written time indication. Why? The future is endless and uncertain. If you state an action will be <em>ongoing</em> at the time of the sentence, you need to clearly define what that time is. &ldquo;She will be working&rdquo; on its own is incorrect. Although, in speech, this is often used if the context (previous sentences) already clarified the time frame.</p><p>Other uses are:</p><ul><li>Predicting or guessing future events. (<em>I think we will be having a hard time tomorrow</em>)</li><li>Asking politely for information about the future. (<em>Will you be working on the assignment tomorrow?</em>)</li><li>Referring to events we expect to happen ( = be ongoing) in the future. (<em>Tomorrow it will be raining cats and dogs</em>)</li></ul><p>The continuous future is a more &ldquo;roundabout way&rdquo; of saying something. If you want to be polite, or avoid conflict, you say &ldquo;Will you be attending the meeting tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>But if you&rsquo;re more direct or certain, you can also just say: &ldquo;Will you attend the meeting tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=about-sentences-and-time-again>About sentences and time, again</h2><p>I said the continuous is used for actions happening at a clear point in time.</p><p><em>But there is no clear point in time for some examples?</em></p><p>There is! It&rsquo;s just not written.</p><p>The simple tense requires you to <em>write</em> a time indication: &ldquo;I walked home <em>in the evening</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>But the continuous tense is about <em>something that is ongoing</em>. Which means the point in time is automatically there: it&rsquo;s <em>when the sentence happens</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I cycled home when I saw two rabbits playing&rdquo; is wrong. The time of the sentence is when you saw the two rabbits playing. And at that point, you were still cycling (not done yet, it isn&rsquo;t yet in the past). So use continous tense.</p><p>&ldquo;I was cycling home when I saw two rabbits playing&rdquo; is correct.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You <em>can</em> rewrite to use simple tense. To do so, give a time indication and don&rsquo;t present the actions as happening at the same time. &ldquo;It was 10am on Sunday. I cycled home and saw two rabbits playing.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I am working on something&rdquo;. When does this happen? Right now! You are currently working on something.</p></div><p>Novels usually apply a lot of simple tense, instead of continuous tense.</p><p>Why? Because stories are told like they are general truths. The writer is recounting what they &ldquo;see&rdquo; happening in their story, in short immediate statements. You&mdash;the reader&mdash;are &ldquo;there&rdquo;, in the same time and place as the scene.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The Hobbit starts with &ldquo;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit&rdquo;&mdash;not &ldquo;a hobbit was living in a hole in the ground when this story takes place&rdquo;.</p><p>And I hope we can agree the first is better.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-simple-tense/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Verbs: simple tense</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-perfect-tense/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Verbs: perfect tense</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{blanks:["me, I","him, he","us, we"],options:[["am working","work","works","worked","be working","are working"],["is working","works","will work","is worked","am working","are working"],["are talking","is talking","am talking","talked","will talking"]],sentence:"Don't disturb $1 $B",type:"blanks"},{general:["You are lying, aren't you?","She is dancing the tango","I am trying my best"],options:[["You were lying, weren't you?","You are lied, aren't you?","You were lied, aren't you?","You are lying, weren't you?"],["She was dancing the tango","She were dancing the tango","She was danced the tango","She danced the tango"],["I was trying my best","I am tried my best","I was tried my best","I will try my best"]],sentence:"Turn this sentence into the past; $1",type:"general"},{general:["He is sleeping","I am swimming","We were baking a cake"],options:[["He will be sleeping at night","He will be sleeping","He will sleeps"],["I will be swimming around breakfast","I will be swimming","I will swimming","I will be swim around breakfast"],["We will be baking a cake when you get here","We will be baking a cake","We will baked a cake","We will were baking a cake when you get here"]],sentence:"Turn this sentence into the future; $1",type:"general"}]</script></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
