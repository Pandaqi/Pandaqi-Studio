Those are the building blocks of English:</p><ul><li>Simple tense: for general truths or predictions about present, past and future</li><li>Continuous tense: for actual specific actions happening at a clear point in time (present, past or future)</li></ul><p>What&rsquo;s missing? Something that <em>happened</em> but is now <em>done</em>. Continuous might talk about something that started and is still going on. Perfect talks about something that used to be going on, but is now <em>over</em>.</p><p>This is the <strong>perfect</strong> tense. No, it&rsquo;s not because the grammar is &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; or &ldquo;the best&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s because &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; is the Latin word for &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.</p><p>This tense is more difficult than the others, though! You can get by fine with the <em>simple</em> and <em>continuous</em>. We&rsquo;re going into the advanced grammar here. It&rsquo;s okay to take a break and practice the other tenses first.</p><p>Because anything that is <em>done</em> &mldr; could have started in a number of ways. Which means there are <strong>6</strong> variations of the perfect tense!</p><blockquote><p><strong>Perfect</strong> tense is for <em>completed</em> actions. They started and happened before the time in the sentence, and they are completed now. (Can also mean one &ldquo;instance&rdquo; of the action is completed, but the action itself continues.)</p></blockquote><h2 id=the-participle>The participle</h2><p>For this tense, we need another way to write our verb. This is called the <strong>past participle</strong>.</p><p>Yes, that is the mysterious word you saw in the tables for auxiliary verbs!</p><ul><li>To be => past participle is <strong>been</strong></li><li>To do => past participle is <strong>done</strong></li><li>To have => past particiepl is <strong>had</strong></li></ul><p>Now you finally use it.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>In Dutch, this is called the &ldquo;voltooid deelwoord&rdquo;, which translates to &ldquo;completed wordpart&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a much easier way to remember it than the word &ldquo;participle&rdquo;.</p></div><p>For most verbs, the <strong>past participle</strong> is the same as the <strong>past</strong> version. Slap a <strong>"-(e)d"</strong> at the end and you&rsquo;re done.</p><p>For irregular verbs, this is different. That&rsquo;s why they are irregular. In general, though, those will &mldr;</p><ul><li>Either end with <strong>-(e)n</strong>. (&ldquo;I spoke&rdquo; => &ldquo;I have spoken.&rdquo;)</li><li>Or be identical to the regular form. (&ldquo;I read a book&rdquo; => &ldquo;I have read a book&rdquo;. This verb is both <em>present</em> and <em>past participle</em>.)</li></ul><h2 id=simple-present-perfect>Simple Present Perfect</h2><p>Constructed using <strong>to have</strong> (present form) + <strong>past participle</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I <strong>have lived</strong> here all my life.</li><li>They <strong>have been</strong> to the zoo twice this week.</li><li>We <strong>have been</strong> to the zoo several times.</li><li>She <strong>has</strong> just <strong>finished</strong> reading the book.</li><li>He <strong>has read</strong> the Hobbit thrice.</li></ul></div><p>Use it for:</p><ul><li>A repeated or continuous action. So it is &ldquo;completed&rdquo; regularly. (&ldquo;I have cycled all my life&rdquo; means you&rsquo;ve started and finished the act of cycling numerous times in your life.)</li><li>A repeated action without a clear indication of time. (&ldquo;We have been to the zoo several times&rdquo;. The action is <em>done</em>. You&rsquo;re already back from each of those trips. But it&rsquo;s not clear when you went to the zoo exactly.)</li><li>An action that was completed in very recent past. (When the word <strong>just</strong> is added.)</li><li>An action when the time is not important, but the <em>result</em>.</li><li>An action that is completed, but the period in which it happens is still going on. (&ldquo;I have thought about Christmas all year.&rdquo; The action of <em>thinking about Christmas</em> is done, many times actually. But we&rsquo;re still in the same year, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important.)</li></ul><h2 id=continuous-present-perfect>Continuous Present Perfect</h2><p>Constructed with <strong>to have</strong> + <strong>been</strong> + <strong>continuous verb form</strong>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s used for actions that started an unspecified time <em>before now</em> and are still going on in the present.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I <strong>have been cycling</strong> to school every day for years. (You started cycling to school long ago. But tomorrow? Yeah, you&rsquo;re cycling to school again.)</li><li>She <strong>has been waiting</strong> for him all day. (When exactly did she start waiting? We don&rsquo;t know! But she&rsquo;s still waiting.)</li><li>They <strong>have been kissing</strong> for an hour now.</li></ul></div><p>It can also be used for actions that have just finished, and we are interested in the results.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>It&rsquo;s been raining since last night (&mldr; which means the streets are still wet)</p></div><p><em>But, didn&rsquo;t you say this was for &ldquo;completed&rdquo; actions?</em> Yes, this distinction is quite subtle. It might take a while to grasp.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the example above: &ldquo;I have been cycling to school every day for years&rdquo;</p><p>The nouns at the end, which indicate time, are vital. Without them, you&rsquo;d use a different tense. Without them, the whole sentence would be in a different time:</p><ul><li>I was cycling to school, when &mldr; => an ongoing action in the past, so <em>continuous tense</em></li><li>I cycled to school for years => a general habit from the past, so <em>simple tense</em></li></ul><p>So what makes this different? Those days, those <em>years</em>, are already completed. You&rsquo;ve been cycling every day, and all those days are in the past and <em>completed</em>. That&rsquo;s why you use perfect tense.</p><p>Try to remember it that way. Whenever a sentence mentions a <em>time period</em> that is completed, repeated, or in the past, the tense changes to <em>perfect tense</em>. If you leave out those nouns, the tense changes with it.</p><h2 id=simple-past-perfect>Simple Past Perfect</h2><p>Constructed using a <strong>to have</strong> (past form) + <strong>past participle</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Jessy <strong>had printed</strong> the papers that morning.</li><li>Mark <strong>had</strong> already <strong>left</strong> when I arrived.</li><li>See <strong>had</strong> just <strong>saved</strong> the document when the computer crashed.</li></ul></div><p>What&rsquo;s the difference with the &ldquo;Simple Present Perfect&rdquo;? I mean, that one alread talked about actions that started or completed before now?</p><p>This one goes <em>back even further</em>. The whole sentence is in the past, because of nouns that indicate this. Notice how each of the examples uses a time indication: &ldquo;that morning&rdquo;, &ldquo;when I arrived&rdquo;, &ldquo;when the computer crashed&rdquo;.</p><p>Something happened in the past. Another thing happened <em>before that</em>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how this tense is usually used. To make clear one event happened before another in the past.</p><h3 id=continuous-past-perfect>Continuous Past Perfect</h3><p>Constructed using <strong>to have</strong> (past form) + <strong>been</strong> + <strong>continuous form</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We <strong>had been trying</strong> to contact him, but we were unable to reach him.</p></div><p>Again, this is the same as the continuous present, but <em>even earlier</em>. The whole sentence is in the past, so the moment <em>before that</em> is &ldquo;even more in the past&rdquo;.</p><p>The example sentence could be rewritten to:</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We were unable to reach him, after we <strong>had been trying</strong> to contact him. <em>(Even earlier, they already tried contacting him)</em></p></div><p>This tense is often used in <em>reported speech</em>. Somebody is talking about an event in the past. And in that event, another statement is made about what happened <em>before that</em>. (In a sense, the perfect tense is about &ldquo;the past before the past&rdquo;.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I have been working in my office all day,&rdquo; Mark told the police.</p><p>Mark told the police that he <strong>had been working</strong> in his office all day.</p></div><h2 id=simple-future-perfect>Simple Future Perfect</h2><p>Constructed using <strong>will have</strong> + <strong>past participle</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>By Monday, they will have arrived at the hotel.</li><li>By the time you read this, I will have left this world.</li><li>He will have signed the papers after the meeting on Friday.</li></ul></div><p>Use it to refer to a point in the future when an action is completed. We place ourselves in the future&mdash;and we see that a certain action is now done or finished!</p><h2 id=continuous-future-perfect>Continuous Future Perfect</h2><p>Constructed using <strong>will have been</strong> + <strong>continuous form</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>By 2016, I <strong>will have been living</strong> in Manchester for five years.</p></div><p>As expected, this is the same as the simple tense. But now the action in the future is <em>still going on</em>. It&rsquo;s true now and it will be true in the future.</p><p>But remember, this is the <em>perfect</em> tense. So it&rsquo;s only used if the sentence also contains a time indication that indicates this is a repeated action, completed regularly.</p><p>The example above could be written in other tenses:</p><ul><li>I will live in Manchester! => it&rsquo;s not true now, but it&rsquo;s a spontaneous promise or decision for the future</li><li>I will be living in Manchester for all of 2016 => in an upcoming time period, the action of living there will be ongoing</li><li>If I die tomorrow, I will have lived in Manchester all my life => once dead, the action of &ldquo;living&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t continue anymore, so it&rsquo;s not continuous</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Next week, I will have been living with Sarah for two years.</p><p>Next week is a clear point in the future. Once there, you&rsquo;ve completed two years of living with Sarah, but you haven&rsquo;t <em>stopped</em> living with her.
