Prepositions often go unnoticed, but are equally important as the other elements of grammar.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve learned what nouns are. You&rsquo;ve learned how to refer to earlier nouns. Most of those were <em>pronouns</em>, used for referring to <em>people</em> or <em>groups of people</em>.</p><p>But grammar is about word order and combinations. We can&rsquo;t just throw all nouns into a blender and expect it to mean something. We need a <em>glue</em> that connects the nouns. A glue that tells us <em>how the different nouns are related</em>.</p><p>There are, however, a lot of glue words. You should view this chapter as more of a <em>reference</em>. Don&rsquo;t try to remember all of this now. Look back whenever you don&rsquo;t know the specific word for something.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Prepositions</strong> are short words connecting two elements of a sentence.</p></blockquote><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Example of prepositions about place/position.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=prepositions.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Example of prepositions about place/position." title="Example of prepositions about place/position." width=950 height=253></picture></figure></p><h2 id=type-1-nouns>Type 1: Nouns</h2><p>These connect nouns by saying how they relate to each other. (Remember pronouns are also a type of noun!)</p><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a cow and a farm. We want to say where the cow is in relation to the farm.</p><p>What do we do? We use a preposition!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The cow <strong>near</strong> the farm. (🐄 📏 🚜)</p></div><p>I keep repeating this, but prepositions help with <em>being specific</em>. Which is <em>good</em>.</p><p>We could just say &ldquo;a cow&rdquo;. But by adding &ldquo;near the farm&rdquo;, we now refer to a specific cow. And the other person knows where that cow is. A lot of information in little time.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The guy <strong>next to</strong> the road eats an apple. (👨‍🌾 🛣️ 🍏)</p><p>The girls <strong>on</strong> their bike tell stories. (👧👧 🔛 🚴‍♀️ 📚)</p><p>I see two mice <strong>under</strong> the bed. (🐁🐁 ⬇️ 🛏️)</p></div><p>All these examples connect a noun (like &ldquo;two mice&rdquo;) with another noun (like &ldquo;the bed&rdquo;). This is a preposition. And it tells us <em>how</em> the two are connected.</p><p>At the end I provide a table with all prepositions. As I said: don&rsquo;t memorize this, use it as a reference.</p><h2 id=type-2-verb--object>Type 2: Verb + object</h2><p>Prepositions can also connect the verb and the <em>object</em>. (Not the subject!)</p><p>The words are the same. But here comes another oddity of English: it&rsquo;s very particular about the combination of <em>verb</em> and <em>preposition</em>. I&rsquo;ll explain that below.</p><p>We already know the verb is related to our object &mldr; but <em>how</em> is it related? A preposition answers this.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The man walks. => The man walks <strong>to</strong> the store. (👨 ➡️ 🏪)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The girl sits. => The girl sits <strong>on</strong> the bed. (👧 🔛 🛏️)</p></div><p>Some verbs accept all prepositions. But many come with only one or several <em>required</em> prepositions. Whichever you choose can completely change the meaning.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no easy rule for this. You&rsquo;ll learn this from reading a lot. Even native speakers often get their prepositions wrong.</p><p>Always check the combination of preposition and verb. Otherwise, your sentence might be completely wrong or attain some other (awkward) meaning.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I am angry <strong>with</strong> you.</li><li>I am crazy <strong>about</strong> you.</li><li>I am jealous <strong>of</strong> you.</li></ul><p>These expressions are very similar: you feel something intangible about another person. But they all use completely different prepositions.</p><p>In Dutch, <em>all</em> these expressions would just use the same preposition (&ldquo;op&rdquo;). But English wants to be special.</p></div><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I do love the expression &ldquo;angry with you&rdquo;. It implies that being angry is something you do <em>together</em>. Like: we&rsquo;re both angry at each other, we&rsquo;re in this together. Which is weirdly poetic.</p></div><h2 id=how-do-i-know>How do I know?</h2><p>To check if something is a preposition, try placing it before <strong>the closet</strong> or <strong>the party</strong> in a sentence. (This is an old trick I learned and basically everyone in the Netherlands seems to know.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We talked about science => We talked <strong>about</strong> the party (must be a preposition ✔️)</p><p>We sat on the bench => We sat <strong>on</strong> the closet (must be a preposition ✔️)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We talked, but softly => We talked, <strong>but</strong> the party (that doesn&rsquo;t make sense ❌)</p><p>We sat like ducks => We sat <strong>like</strong> the party (that doesn&rsquo;t make sense ❌)</p></div><p>A word like &ldquo;but&rdquo; is a <em>conjunction</em>. These will be taught near the end of the course: <a href=../conjunctions-compound-words/>Compounds & Conjunctions</a>.</p><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p>Prepositions can be neatly grouped into three categories: <strong>time</strong>, <strong>place</strong> and <strong>movement</strong></p><p>They are a &ldquo;closed group&rdquo;: no more prepositions will be added. (Nouns are very much &ldquo;open&rdquo;: we constantly invent new words, terminology and phrases.) It&rsquo;s unlikely somebody invents a preposition we somehow failed to discover for thousands of years 😛</p><h3 id=time>Time</h3><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>after</td><td>at</td><td>before</td><td>by</td></tr><tr><td>during</td><td>from</td><td>past</td><td>since</td></tr><tr><td>through</td><td>to</td><td>until</td><td>upon</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=place>Place</h3><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>above</td><td>behind</td><td>below</td><td>beside</td></tr><tr><td>between</td><td>beyond</td><td>by</td><td>in</td></tr><tr><td>inside</td><td>near</td><td>on</td><td>outside</td></tr><tr><td>over</td><td>through</td><td>under</td><td>with</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=movement>Movement</h3><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>against</td><td>along</td><td>down</td><td>from</td></tr><tr><td>into</td><td>off</td><td>on</td><td>onto</td></tr><tr><td>out of</td><td>toward</td><td>up</td><td>upon</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/indefinite-pronouns/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Indefinite Pronouns</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-the-basics/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Verbs: the basics</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["A short word explaining how two parts of a sentence are connected","A short word to place before a noun to make it more important","A short word to replace a pronoun"],terms:["Preposition"],type:"terms"},{blanks:["the party","class","the couch","the sun comes up","the meeting","our favorite spot"],options:[["after","off","down"],["during","up","by"],["on","outside","onto"],["until","toward","out of"],["at","upon","between"],["near","with","since"]],sentence:"Let's talk $B $1",type:"blanks"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
