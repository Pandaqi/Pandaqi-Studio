You know the present tense and how to modify it. You know common verbs: to be, to do and to have. How they work on their own, and how they help other verbs. You will see those auxiliary verbs in action very soon.</p><p>One topic remains, before we can learn the other tenses: negation. We&rsquo;ve already seen it at work for <em>nouns</em>. The word remains the same: <strong>not</strong>.</p><p>But English remains English. Of course we&rsquo;re going to <strong>contract</strong> this!</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Remember: contraction means &ldquo;make smaller&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s when you combine two words into one.</p></div><h2 id=helper-negations>Helper negations</h2><p>Because auxiliary and modal verbs are <em>so common</em>, they have contractions. If a sentence is negated, the word <strong>not</strong> is eaten by the verb to get the table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>-</th><th>to be</th><th>-</th><th>to do</th><th>-</th><th>to have</th><th>-</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>-</td><td><em>present</em></td><td><em>past</em></td><td><em>present</em></td><td><em>past</em></td><td><em>present</em></td><td><em>past</em></td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>aren&rsquo;t</td><td>wasn&rsquo;t</td><td>don&rsquo;t</td><td>didn&rsquo;t</td><td>haven&rsquo;t</td><td>hadn&rsquo;t</td></tr><tr><td>He/she/it</td><td>isn&rsquo;t</td><td>wasn&rsquo;t</td><td>doesn&rsquo;t</td><td>didn&rsquo;t</td><td>hasn&rsquo;t</td><td>hadn&rsquo;t</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>aren&rsquo;t</td><td>weren&rsquo;t</td><td>don&rsquo;t</td><td>didn&rsquo;t</td><td>haven&rsquo;t</td><td>hadn&rsquo;t</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To negate a sentence, replace the verb by its contraction.</p><p>When used on their own &mldr;</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>You are happy (😀) => You aren&rsquo;t happy (😡)</li><li>We are friends (🤝) => We aren&rsquo;t friends (👎)</li><li>I have the time (⏳) => I haven&rsquo;t the time (⌛)</li></ul></div><p>The modal verbs form their contraction the same way: by adding <strong>n&rsquo;t</strong> at the end.</p><p>The verb <strong>will</strong> is special. It contracts to <strong>won&rsquo;t</strong>. Its other form, <strong>shall</strong>, contracts to <strong>shan&rsquo;t</strong>.</p><p>So, when used as a modal verb &mldr;</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>You should know this => You shouldn&rsquo;t know this!</li><li>You can dance => You can&rsquo;t dance</li><li>We could have won => We couldn&rsquo;t have won anyway</li><li>I will try the milk => I won&rsquo;t try the milk</li></ul></div><h2 id=all-other-negations>All other negations</h2><p>Now I hope you realize something important. All other verbs &mldr; don&rsquo;t have this negated version.</p><p>I mean, how would you negate &ldquo;to swim&rdquo;? Swimn&rsquo;t? Notswim? Swimnot?</p><p>How do we negate those? By <em>adding</em> a helper verb and negating <em>that</em>.</p><p>For the <strong>present simple</strong>, it&rsquo;s <strong>do</strong>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>You tell a story => You <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> tell a story</li><li>We walk to the beach => We <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> walk to the beach.</li><li>They eat bread => They <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> eat bread.</li></ul></div><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>You can also add &ldquo;do&rdquo; in a normal sentence. But that really emphasizes the word, like you&rsquo;re trying to make a point: &ldquo;But &mldr; but &mldr; they <em>do</em> eat bread! 😮&rdquo;</p></div><p>Which modal verb to add depends on the tense. As you saw, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;do&rdquo; for the present.</p><p><em>Why</em>? Because if a <em>modal verb</em> is present, <em>they</em> are responsible for having the correct tense! The main verb can chill out and do nothing. The modal verb will be changed to show the tense.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I walked to the beach => I <strong>didn&rsquo;t</strong> walk to the beach</li><li>They danced all night => They <strong>didn&rsquo;t</strong> dance all night.</li></ul></div><p>Don&rsquo;t worry. The tenses will be explained soon!</p><p>Just remember this idea: when a modal verb is present, <em>they</em> will conjugate to fit the tense. And the main verb stays the same.</p><h2 id=pronoun-contractions>Pronoun Contractions</h2><p>These verbs are also commonly paired with pronouns. So, obviously, English created contractions for that.</p><p>All auxiliary verbs can be contracted with the subject, as long as &mldr;</p><ul><li>The sentence is <em>affirmative</em> (not negated)</li><li>The subject is a <em>pronoun</em> or <em>determiner</em> (you&rsquo;ll learn those later)</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>-</th><th>to be</th><th>to have</th><th>had</th><th>will</th><th>would</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I</td><td>I&rsquo;m</td><td>I&rsquo;ve</td><td>I&rsquo;d</td><td>I&rsquo;ll</td><td>I&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>You</td><td>You&rsquo;re</td><td>You&rsquo;ve</td><td>You&rsquo;d</td><td>You&rsquo;ll</td><td>You&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>He</td><td>He&rsquo;s</td><td>He&rsquo;s</td><td>He&rsquo;d</td><td>He&rsquo;ll</td><td>He&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>She</td><td>She&rsquo;s</td><td>She&rsquo;s</td><td>She&rsquo;d</td><td>She&rsquo;ll</td><td>She&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>It</td><td>It&rsquo;s</td><td>It&rsquo;s</td><td>It&rsquo;d</td><td>It&rsquo;ll</td><td>It&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>We</td><td>We&rsquo;re</td><td>We&rsquo;ve</td><td>We&rsquo;d</td><td>We&rsquo;ll</td><td>We&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>They</td><td>They&rsquo;re</td><td>They&rsquo;ve</td><td>They&rsquo;d</td><td>They&rsquo;ll</td><td>They&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>There</td><td>There&rsquo;s</td><td>There&rsquo;s</td><td>There&rsquo;d</td><td>There&rsquo;ll</td><td>There&rsquo;d</td></tr><tr><td>That</td><td>That&rsquo;s</td><td></td><td>That&rsquo;d</td><td>That&rsquo;ll</td><td>That&rsquo;d</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>&ldquo;There&rdquo; and &ldquo;that&rdquo; are the determiners. You can see them as pronouns for non-human things. &ldquo;I like my garden. There&rsquo;s so much life!&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>I am Tiamo => <strong>I&rsquo;m</strong> Tiamo</li><li>I have brought cake => <strong>I&rsquo;ve</strong> brought cake</li><li>When I was young, I would sing => When I was young, <strong>I&rsquo;d</strong> sing</li><li>We will do that => <strong>We&rsquo;ll</strong> do that</li></ul></div><p>A common error is writing &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;its&rdquo; in the wrong situations. The first one is a contraction of a <em>pronoun</em> and <em>verb</em>. The second one is a <em>possessive pronoun</em>. (These were taught at <a href=../pronouns/>Pronouns</a>.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>It is no problem => <strong>It&rsquo;s</strong> no problem</li><li>My phone has lost the battery it has => My phone has lost <strong>its</strong> battery</li></ul></div><p>Hopefully you agree that these contractions save a lot of space. This is why English can communicate a lot of information with very few words or symbols.</p><p>Some people are very <em>against</em> contractions. I don&rsquo;t agree. Always use them, it&rsquo;s short and sweet. The <em>only</em> reason to write something in full, is to <em>emphasize</em> it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t a student here!&rdquo; => &ldquo;No, I <em>am</em> a student here!&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=questions>Questions</h2><p>In the <a href=../pronouns/>Pronouns</a> chapter, I discussed contractions to change the intention of a <em>question</em>. Now we have verbs, contractions and negation!</p><p>Which means I can formally explain and define how to form questions in English.</p><p>To form a question, <strong>switch the subject and modal verb</strong>. So, the sentence starts with the modal verb and the subject comes after it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You have seen the news => Have you seen the news?</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He should take the bus => Should he take the bus?</p></div><p>Again, if no modal verb exists, you insert it yourself.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>They walk down the road => <strong>Do</strong> they walk down the road?</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You see a cow => <strong>Do</strong> you see a cow?</p></div><p>And to answer questions, you repeat the modal verb. If the answer is negative, you negate it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Have you seen the news? => Yes, <strong>I have</strong>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Do you walk down the road? => No, <strong>I don&rsquo;t</strong>.</p></div><h2 id=cross-questions>Cross questions</h2><p>And finally, another interesting bit from the English language. They have a very indirect way of asking questions, a bit passive-agressive.</p><ul><li>First you simply make a <em>statement</em>. (Not a question, just a statement.)</li><li>Then you <strong>repeat the modal verb and subject, but reversed</strong>.</li></ul><p>I call this a cross question. You can remember it that way. If the statement is affirmative, they repeat it negated. If the statement is negative, they repeat it affirmative.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>The image my English teacher drew when she explained this in high school.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=cross_questions.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="The image my English teacher drew when she explained this in high school." title="The image my English teacher drew when she explained this in high school." width=950 height=185></picture></figure></p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You&rsquo;ve eaten all the cookies, <strong>haven&rsquo;t you</strong>?! (Sentence is positive, so repeat with a negative.)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He didn&rsquo;t do his homework, <strong>did he</strong>?! (Sentence is negative, so repeat with a positive.)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>They will finish in time, <strong>won&rsquo;t they</strong>?</p></div><p>Essentially, this turns a statement into a question. I think it&rsquo;s a fun bit of the English language. It&rsquo;s also very common, so it&rsquo;s good to learn it now.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, finally, we can continue with the actual verb tenses.</p><p>English has well-defined tenses. They may seem <em>similar</em> to one in your own language, but are probably different if you look more closely.</p><p>But you should be very comfortable with the hiccups of English by now! So I&rsquo;m sure it is no problem. Let&rsquo;s get some action going now.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-helpers/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Verbs: helpers</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-simple-tense/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Verbs: simple tense</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{blanks:["I","You","She"],options:[["wasn't","aren't","hadn't"],["weren't","didn't","isn't"],["wasn't","doesn't","hasn't"]],sentence:"$1 $B at the party yesterday",type:"blanks"},{blanks:["She didn't","You did"],options:[["did she?","didn't she?","is she?"],["didn't you?","did you","have you?"]],sentence:"$1 do the dishes, $B",type:"blanks"},{general:["I have two dogs","We did the work yesterday","You are very good at that"],options:[["I don't have two dogs","I not have two dogs","I have not two dogs"],["We didn't do the work yesterday","We didn't the work yesterday","We not did they work yesterday"],["You aren't very good at that","You don't are very good at that","You not were very good at that"]],sentence:"Negate this sentence; $1",type:"general"},{general:["I am very proud of what you have done","They are not ready."],options:[["I'm very proud of what you've done","I'm very proud of what you have done","I am very proud of what you've done"],["They aren't ready","They're not ready","They are not-ready"]],sentence:"Contract this sentence; $1",type:"general"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
