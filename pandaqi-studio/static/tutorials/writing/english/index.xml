I don&amp;rsquo;t like that approach.</description></item><item><title>Verbs: continuous tense</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-continous-tense/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-continous-tense/</guid><description>The continuous tense is named quite well.

Because it&amp;rsquo;s shorter, simpler and more direct.</description></item><item><title>Adjectives</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/adjectives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/english/adjectives/</guid><description>Well done!
