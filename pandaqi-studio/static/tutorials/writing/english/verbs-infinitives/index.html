It&rsquo;s how you find verbs in the dictionary. If you drop the <code>to</code>, you get the form which you can use in like 80% of all sentences.</p><p>So it was a great way to introduce verbs. But I left out some important details and nuances, which I&rsquo;d like to discuss now. Even though the infinitive isn&rsquo;t often used, it helps understand other concepts:</p><ul><li>I already explained how it was closely linked to the gerund. (Which is a common grammar construct.)</li><li>The next chapter&mdash;the last one on verbs&mdash;will require this knowledge.</li></ul><p>Two different types of infinitives exist:</p><ul><li>The regular infinitive: <strong>to + base verb</strong> (<em>to remember</em>)</li><li>The zero infinitive: <strong>base verb</strong> (<em>remember</em>)</li></ul><p>To negate it, you simply put the word <strong>not</strong> in front. (This can always be done, no contraction or irregularity needed.)</p><h2 id=regular-infinitive>Regular Infinitive</h2><h3 id=purpose-or-intention>Purpose or intention</h3><p>You can test this by replacing <em>to</em> with <em>in order to</em> (or <em>so as to</em>) and the sentence should still work.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She came to school <strong>to receive</strong> her award. (üëß‚û°Ô∏èüè´ to üëêüèÜ)</p><p>She came to school <strong>in order to receive</strong> her award.</p></div><h3 id=subject>Subject</h3><p>The original use I explained. The verb as the <em>general concept</em> of doing something.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p><strong>To find</strong> true love is the purpose of life!</p></div><h3 id=to-modify-a-noun>To modify a noun</h3><p>You modify a noun by saying in what <em>way</em> it is true.</p><p>For example, take the sentence: &ldquo;You are easy.&rdquo;</p><p>They are &ldquo;easy&rdquo;, but in what way? In which event are they easy?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s modify it with an infinitive: &ldquo;You are easy <em>to convince</em>&rdquo;.</p><p>Now we know. They are easy when you&rsquo;re trying to &ldquo;convince&rdquo; them!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>She is a nice girl <strong>to flirt</strong> with. (How is &ldquo;nice&rdquo; meant? For flirting.)</li><li>They are a dangerous group <strong>to run into</strong> late at night. (How are they &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;? If you run into them.)</li><li>Jim is the worst person <strong>to ask</strong> for these matters. (How is Jim the &ldquo;worst&rdquo;? When asking him.)</li></ul></div><h3 id=when-measuring-an-action>When measuring an action</h3><p>Often, an action is only taken if you measure that it&rsquo;s possible. Or a good idea.</p><p>The word <strong>too</strong> measures an extreme. (Something is <em>too much</em>.)</p><p>The word <strong>enough</strong> measures a good balance. (Something is <em>just enough</em>.)</p><p>After these, an infinitive follows that describes <em>for what action</em> you&rsquo;re measuring something.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>There is enough food <strong>to feed</strong> everyone here.</li><li>She is too beautiful <strong>to ignore</strong>.</li><li>They aren&rsquo;t smart enough <strong>to study</strong> this.</li></ul></div><h3 id=measuring-with-nouns>Measuring with nouns</h3><p>The above can be extended when talking about a <em>noun</em> and if it <em>can be used</em> for an action. For example, is this space big enough for dancing? Is the weather good enough for a light jacket?</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>They will need some space <strong>to work</strong> in.</li><li>Would you like a slice of cake <strong>to eat</strong>?</li><li>You require two goals <strong>to play</strong> soccer</li></ul></div><h3 id=questions>Questions</h3><p>Infinitives are great for <em>questions</em>. Because they are about general actions, instead of someone actually doing it. You don&rsquo;t often ask if somebody is <em>currently dancing</em>, you might ask if they know <em>how to dance in general</em>.</p><p>This is the structure:</p><ul><li>Use one of the interrogative verbs: <em>ask, decide, explain, forget, know, show, tell</em> and <em>understand</em> c</li><li>Follow it with a question word (like <em>how</em> or <em>why</em>)</li><li>And then add the infinitive.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve explained how questions are usually answered by repeating the structure. This remains true here.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Do you know how <strong>to draw</strong> a cat? (‚úèÔ∏èüê±)</li><li>Has he explained when it&rsquo;s best <strong>to mow</strong> the lawn? (üåøüöú)</li><li>No, but I&rsquo;ve been shown how <strong>to draw</strong> a dog instead. (‚úèÔ∏èüêï)</li></ul></div><h3 id=about-style>About style</h3><p>Infinitives cause prepositions (or other glue words) to be pushed towards the <em>back</em> of the sentence.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Do you know which team you play in?</p></div><p>This is frowned upon. Glue words don&rsquo;t work that well when you&rsquo;re, well, not glueing things together, but placing it at the <em>end</em>. Communication is more clear if you <strong>don&rsquo;t do this</strong>.</p><p>How do you rewrite a sentence like that? Keep the prepositions before the thing they belong to. If necessary, add an extra word to make the sentence flow better.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Do you know <strong>in which team</strong> you play?</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I&rsquo;ve told you what to use this machine for => I&rsquo;ve told you <strong>for what</strong> (purpose) to use this machine.</p></div><p>It takes some effort. But it makes your communication more professional and easy to follow.</p><h2 id=zero-infinitive>Zero Infinitive</h2><p>Fortunately, the zero infinitive has far fewer uses.</p><h3 id=after-modal-verbs>After modal verbs</h3><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>He can&rsquo;t <strong>explain</strong> that to you now.</li><li>Would she <strong>tell</strong> you if she knew?</li></ul></div><h3 id=after-verbs-of-perception>After verbs of perception</h3><p>The construction here is: Verb + object + zero infinitive. The object comes between them!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>They heard her scream.</li><li>We watched him try to get on his bike.</li></ul></div><p>People often wrongly write &ldquo;we watched him <em>trying</em> to get on his bike&rdquo;. This feels correct, but it&rsquo;s not.</p><p>Adding a comma also doesn&rsquo;t save you: &ldquo;We watched him, trying to get on his bike&rdquo; The subject of the sentence is <em>we</em>, so this implies that <em>we</em> are trying to get on <em>his</em> bike!</p><p>You&rsquo;d need a small rewrites if you really want to use the -ing form: &ldquo;We watched him as he was <em>trying</em> to get on his bike.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=after-specific-expressions>After specific expressions</h3><p>These expressions are:</p><ul><li>The verbs <em>make</em> and <em>let</em></li><li>The expression <em>had better</em></li><li>In combination with <em>why</em>, making a suggestion.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Let&rsquo;s <strong>go</strong>!</li><li>You made him <strong>do</strong> that.</li><li>She had better <strong>go</strong> to bed now.</li><li>You&rsquo;d better <strong>give</strong> me some more money!</li><li>Why <strong>wait</strong> until he returns?</li><li>Why not <strong>sleep</strong> at Jim&rsquo;s place?*</li></ul></div><h2 id=imperative>Imperative</h2><p>The &ldquo;imperative&rdquo; tense is very simple and small&mdash;now that you know the infinitive. It is used to <strong>give commands or instructions</strong>.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>In Dutch, it&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;gebiedende wijs&rdquo;, which translates to &ldquo;the commanding way&rdquo;.</p></div><p>This is only used if you&rsquo;re <em>directly speaking</em> with someone else. You won&rsquo;t find it in writing. And never in third person.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you planned to go to an appointment with someone else. But they are taking a lot of time to prepare. Then you say &ldquo;Hurry up! We&rsquo;re almost late!&rdquo;</p><p>The imperative is simply the verb stem, without <em>anything</em> else!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Find out yourself!</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be so lazy.</li><li>Wait!</li></ul></div><p>It can be used in first person (both singular and plural) by adding the word &ldquo;let&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;let us&rdquo; are contracted to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s&rdquo;.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>Let us go on holiday.</li><li>Let&rsquo;s not talk about this again.</li><li>Let me explain!</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-present-participle/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Verbs: present participle</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/verbs-passive/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Verbs: passive voice</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["Base form of a verb; as found in dictionary","Commanding form of a verb","Words using the imperial system","Verbs explaining a never-ending action","Shorter form of a verb by losing the first two letters"],terms:["Infinitive","Imperative"],type:"terms"},{general:["I like to sing","They are dancing","He can't dance to save his life","We have enough of your troubles!","We have enough money to spend","To be young again, what a dream!","Let's go to the zoo"],options:[["Yes","No"],["No","Yes"],["Yes","No"],["No","Yes"],["Yes","No"],["Yes","No"],["No","Yes"]],sentence:"Does this use an infinitive? $1",type:"general"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
