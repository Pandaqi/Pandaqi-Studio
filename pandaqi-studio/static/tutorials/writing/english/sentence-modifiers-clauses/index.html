Determine the action, who does it, who is the target of the action, and who might participate.</p><p>But if you look at the examples, they lack detail. &ldquo;The man eats an apple&rdquo;. Okay, but &mldr;</p><ul><li>What type of apple?</li><li>What does the man look like?</li><li>When does he eat it?</li><li>How does he eat it?</li><li>Why does he keep eating so many apples?</li></ul><p>There are countless more details to give about any part of a sentence. These details will be discussed in the rest of the course. But here&rsquo;s a summary to already make you familiar with them.</p><h2 id=modifiers>Modifiers</h2><p>Modifiers come in two types.</p><ul><li><strong>Specifying nouns</strong>: these modify the subject or object. (These are always <em>nouns</em>. You&rsquo;ll learn about them soon.)</li><li><strong>Modifying verbs</strong>: these modify the verb.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The <strong>black</strong> cat eats the <strong>red</strong> apple. (🐈‍⬛ 🍽️ 🍎)</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The woman spoke <strong>loudly</strong>. (👩 📢)</p><p>The boy biked <strong>quickly</strong>. (👦 🚴 💨)</p></div><p>These details usually answer one of these questions:</p><ul><li>Who?</li><li>What?</li><li>When?</li><li>Where?</li><li>Why?</li><li>How?</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;Peter hit Frank.&rdquo; When did Peter hit Frank? &ldquo;<strong>Yesterday</strong>, Peter hit Frank&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;The cat jumped.&rdquo; To where did the cat jump? &ldquo;The cat jumped <strong>on the box</strong>&rdquo;</p></div><p>These will be explained in-depth later in the course&mdash;in the <a href=../adjectives/>Adjectives</a> chapter.</p><h2 id=clauses>Clauses</h2><p>So far, even with modifiers, sentences are really short and basic. You can only say some tiny thing about the existing sentence. What if we want longer sentences? What if we want to <em>combine</em> two related thoughts?</p><p>Well, if you can form short sentences &mldr; you can form any sentence!</p><p>Sentences can be chained together. If you keep words grouped based on meaning, it will be valid. Such an extension is called a <strong>clause</strong> and place between <strong>commas</strong> (<code>,</code>).</p><p>Two common clauses exist.</p><ul><li><strong>Relative Clauses</strong>: these say something extra about the subject or (in)direct object of a sentence. They are placed directly behind the word they talk about.</li><li><strong>Subordinate Clauses</strong>: a complete sentence within another sentence. Because it is its own sentence, it needs its own <em>subject</em> and _verb.</li></ul><p>These will also be explained more in-depth later in the course&mdash;in the <a href=../adverbs/>Adverbs</a> chapter.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The man, <strong>who helped me when I was sick</strong>, wears a hat.</p><p>(👨, ❤️‍🩹 🤒, 🎩)</p><p>What&rsquo;s this? A relative clause. It adds extra information about that man, the subject of the sentence.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The man eats the apple, <strong>while the girl eats a burger.</strong></p><p>(👨 🍽️ 🍏, 👧 🍽️ 🍔)</p><p>What&rsquo;s this? A subordinate clause. It says nothing about the previous sentence. It could stand on its own.</p></div><p>As always, there&rsquo;s no reason to complicate things. If possible, just keep sentences short. Place a dot and start a fresh sentence. Use a single-word modifier in the right place. These &ldquo;clauses&rdquo; will quickly make something hard to read or needlessly complicated.</p><p><em>Why do clauses exist then?</em> Sometimes they <em>are</em> a faster way of communicating something. Sometimes they just sound better. Sometimes it helps the flow or rhythm of the text, like when writing a novel. Some people naturally like speaking that way, while others do not.</p><p>In the example above, I connected &ldquo;the man eats the apple&rdquo; and &ldquo;the girl eats the burger&rdquo; into the same sentence with &ldquo;while&rdquo;. This communicates these two things happened <em>at the same time</em>. I could make these two separate sentences, but you&rsquo;d lose that bit of information.</p><p>Language gives you options. It&rsquo;s up to you how to put them to use.</p><p>But &mldr; there <em>is</em> a reason why English is especially fond of these clauses.</p><h2 id=the-english-culture>The English culture</h2><p>England has always been a culture of snarky and witty remarks. That&rsquo;s reflected in their language. Sentences often have remarks at the start or end. These are seperated with a comma (<code>,</code>) and sometimes a dash (<code>---</code>). Because it&rsquo;s just a remark, a quick note, they don&rsquo;t have to be full sentences.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Frankly, I do not know.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Additionally, verbs are just really cool.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The man eats an apple, as one does.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The girl just likes reading books&mdash;let her be!</p></div><p>Once you know this, you&rsquo;ll see it everywhere. And it will help simplify English sentences for you, as you can strip these comments.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Dutch doesn&rsquo;t really allow this, which is a shame. Over time, I learned to simply place remarks in Dutch between parentheses: <code>(this is a remark)</code>. No other way seemed suitable. English is very <em>compact</em> that way. A typical Dutch text is about 10% longer than its English translation.</p></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This concludes the chapters on basic sentence structure and word roles.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve seen that sentences are always built from a <em>subject</em> and a <em>verb</em>. The next chapters will, therefore, focus on these two exclusively.</p><p>They will start with <em>nouns</em> and their subgroup <em>pronouns</em>. Within a few chapters, you can easily create subjects and objects any way you like.</p><p>And then come the <em>verbs</em>. Because we communicate in terms of <em>action</em>, they are the biggest group to learn about. I didn&rsquo;t want to start with them, as I think nouns are equally important <em>and</em> easier to grasp.</p><p>Once these two parts are done, you already should be able to write almost anything you want.</p><p>The rest of the course talks about the other word types (the modifiers briefly shown above) and more advanced clauses.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/sentence-object/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Sentences: Object</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/english/nouns-roles-gender/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Nouns: Roles & Gender</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-quiz secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Test your knowledge with the quiz!</div><div class="right-block style-quiz secondary-style-"><section class=quiz-container><div class=quiz-question id=quiz-question>... question text ...</div><div class=quiz-answers id=quiz-answers>... question answers ...</div><div class=quiz-next-question id=quiz-next-question>... question continue buttons ...</div></section><script>window.QUIZ_DATA=[{options:["A word that gives more details about the subject or object","A word that gives more details about a verb","A sentence that gives more detail about the subject","A sentence connected to another, but which is unrelated or less important.","When you talk about species","When the action in your sentence is about changing something","A sentence about family and relatives","A sentence about submarines"],terms:["Specifying noun","Modifying verb","Relative clause","Subordinate clause"],type:"terms"},{options:["Subject","Modifying verb","Verb","Specifying noun","Direct object","Indirect object"],parts:["I","quickly","throw","red","the ball","the dog"],sentence:"I quickly throw the red ball to the dog.",type:"parts"},{options:["Subject","Relative clause","Verb","Subordinate clause"],parts:["James","who likes soccer","practices","but Sarah doesn't"],sentence:"James, who likes soccer, practices it often, but Sarah doesn't.",type:"parts"}]</script></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
