Abrams. They also know countless examples of stories that thought they were being clever by adding a big &ldquo;plot twist&rdquo; or &ldquo;surprise revelation&rdquo;, but were actually being dumb and ruining their own story.</p><p>This chapter (and the next) tries to define what these two things are. Why they matter, how to do them well, and how to do them badly.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-plot-twist>What is a plot twist?</h2><p>A plot twist is <strong>not</strong> a random occurrence that sends the plot in an entirely different direction. It&rsquo;s also <strong>not</strong> something that is &ldquo;surprising&rdquo; or &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo;.</p><p>The whole idea of a plot is that it constantly changes. New obstacles appear, characters make choices that change the course of the plot, etcetera. A plot is <em>riddled</em> with &ldquo;plot points&rdquo; or &ldquo;plot turns&rdquo; that bring (optionally surprising) changes.</p><p>Yes, a plot twist is the &ldquo;most extreme&rdquo; type of plot point. It irreversibly, drastically changes the plot from now on.</p><p>But if the reader paid attention, the plot twist is actually &mldr; expected and completely logical.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not called a plot twist because you are required to shock and surprise your viewer. It&rsquo;s called that because it should recontextualize everything that came before. (With this new development, the previous chunk of plot suddenly gets a different meaning.)</p><p>Below is my most practical definition of a plot twist.</p><blockquote><p>Two things you thought were different, are actually the same.</p></blockquote><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>You also have the rare opposite: two things you thought were the same, are actually different.</p></div><p>This is the <em>core</em> of puzzles and mysteries. A good mystery is hard to solve because it requires a creative &ldquo;leap&rdquo; to connect two things that seemed different.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>We have a story in which our hero chases the killer of his parents. Along the way, he meets a few other detectives, who help him with the case. One of them is really good at his job and really likeable. He becomes close friends and a crucial part of the team.</p><p>You guessed it. All this time, &ldquo;the killer&rdquo; and &ldquo;that detective&rdquo; are two separate entities to you. During the climax, they turn out to be the same guy. PLOT TWIST.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The hero is on an adventure to get the Scroll of Life (or whatever magical artefact). They think it will heal their sick friend. He carries a backpack with certain items, among them a book with many empty pages.</p><p>You guessed it. In the climax, the &ldquo;Scroll of Life&rdquo; and that book in his backpack turn out to be the same thing. PLOT TWIST.</p></div><h2 id=a-natural-consequence>A natural consequence</h2><p>So, a plot twist requires two things to be the same. What does this require? What must you always do to achieve this?</p><p>Actually <em>introduce</em> the two things. And introduce them enough to make the reader understand what they are.</p><p>In other words, a plot twist <strong>cannot</strong> work without the <strong>proper setup</strong>!</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to teach you setup and payoff first. A plot twist requires it, otherwise it&rsquo;s simply not a plot twist. It&rsquo;s a random event designed to superficially surprise, and that&rsquo;s it.</p><h3 id=example-spiderman>Example: Spiderman</h3><p>Let me give another example from an existing movie (spoilers!).</p><p>In <em>Spiderman: Homecoming</em>, there&rsquo;s a great plot twist that really made the movie better for me. For half the movie, spiderman has been fighting a certain antagonist. He has seen his face, while his enemy doesn&rsquo;t know the real identity of spiderman.</p><p>He wants to take a girl he likes to Homecoming. So he visits her at home to ask her father&rsquo;s blessing. Guess what? The camera cuts to the father &mldr; and it&rsquo;s the enemy he&rsquo;s been fighting half the movie. PLOT TWIST.</p><p>Two characters you automatically assumed were different (spiderman&rsquo;s enemy, girl&rsquo;s dad) are actually the same.</p><p>This only works well, though, because both have been setup.</p><ul><li>Spiderman has repeatedly seen and engaged with this enemy.</li><li>Peter Parker has repeatedly talked about visiting her home, meeting her parents, and how nervous he is about it</li></ul><h2 id=as-always-we-need-consequences>As always, we need consequences</h2><p>Any plot twist might surprise, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it good. The plot twist also has to have <strong>consequences</strong>. Without it, what&rsquo;s the point?</p><p>For example, you might write a story in which somebody briefly talks about friends they have (at school). In some later chapter, they also talk about the usernames of people with whom they chat online. PLOT TWIST: one of those usernames is actually from a classmate! Those two things are the same!</p><p>That&rsquo;s &mldr; nice, I guess, but now what? The hero just learned that two irrelevant entities in the story belong to the same person. If you only mentioned these classmates and usernames once, the reader probably already forgot. It&rsquo;s not meaningful, it&rsquo;s not impactful.</p><p>The general rule is &mldr;</p><blockquote><p>The two things in a plot twist, that turn out to be the same thing, should be at their <strong>peak relevancy</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The plot twist from my example would work if those friends and usernames had a huge role in the story.</p><p>Maybe something has been stolen from the hero. Then they see people talking about it online, with pictures as proof. Obviously, the hero wants the object back, and wants to find the thief.</p><p>Now the same plot twist works. The revelation that one of those usernames is from a friend of his, is very relevant information to the hero&rsquo;s goal. The best timing for the plot twist, is right when the hero is stuck with the investigation, or ready to decisively <em>act</em> upon it. (If they learn this info, but cannot really act on it right now, it&rsquo;s not at peak relevancy.)</p><h2 id=now-write>Now write</h2><p>Write a story that&rsquo;s all about a plot twist.</p><ul><li>As usual, the story introduces multiple &ldquo;things&rdquo; (characters, objects, locations).</li><li>Plan two things to actually be the same. Make it two things that the reader will least expect, but which have the greatest impact when the twist happens.</li><li>Set them up properly.</li><li>Then execute the twist during the climax of the story.</li></ul></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/setup-and-payoff/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Setup & Payoff</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/mystery-boxes/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Mystery Boxes</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
