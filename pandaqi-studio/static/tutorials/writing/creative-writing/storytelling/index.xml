After years of writing and teaching, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a simple truth.</description></item><item><title>Starting a story</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/starting-a-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/starting-a-story/</guid><description>These two chapters will talk about two things that seem identical, but are quite different. This chapter is about where to get ideas (if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one).</description></item><item><title>Why we tell stories</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/why-we-tell-stories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/why-we-tell-stories/</guid><description>As a general principle, I always start with why?. In most cases, that is the most interesting question and the one that will teach you the most.</description></item><item><title>The definition of story</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-definition-of-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-definition-of-story/</guid><description>Okay, so you have an idea, and you&amp;rsquo;ve answered the questions from the first chapter (about why you&amp;rsquo;re writing it).</description></item><item><title>Continuing a story</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/continuing-a-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/continuing-a-story/</guid><description>Great! You&amp;rsquo;ve started a story! You have a strong main character and initial conflict, and you&amp;rsquo;re off to the races.</description></item><item><title>Narrative Structure</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/narrative-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/narrative-structure/</guid><description>Ideas about how to approach a story are called narrative structure. If you want to find more of these, after doing the rest of this course, look up that term.</description></item><item><title>The 3 Act Structure</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-three-act-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-three-act-structure/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue with the most common structure (probably). One that is mentioned absolutely everywhere, although I like the &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; version more than the simplified one.</description></item><item><title>The 4 Act Structure</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-act-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-act-structure/</guid><description>Most people admit that the 3 Act Structure is really a 4 Act Structure. These might seem the same at first glance&amp;mdash;and they are.</description></item><item><title>The Story Circle</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-story-circle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-story-circle/</guid><description>The story circle is usually attributed to famous writer Dan Harmon. It&amp;rsquo;s a simplified version of what the next chapter is about (the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey).</description></item><item><title>The Hero's Journey</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-heros-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-heros-journey/</guid><description>This structure is also called the monomyth. It reappears in many myths from all over the world, from all eras of human history.</description></item><item><title>The A, B and C story</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-a-b-c-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-a-b-c-story/</guid><description>All the narrative structures discussed so far pertain to one storyline. Most stories, however, contain multiple &amp;ldquo;storylines&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;story threads&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>The Four Corners of Society</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-corners-of-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-corners-of-society/</guid><description>Over the years, I have noticed that I am more of a &amp;ldquo;societal&amp;rdquo; writer. I tend to focus on the whole of society in the worlds I invent, not on just one hero and their journey through it.</description></item><item><title>Freytag's Pyramid</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/freytags-pyramid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/freytags-pyramid/</guid><description>So far, our narrative structures have looked like lines (trending upward) or circles. What if &amp;hellip; the structure looked like a pyramid instead?</description></item><item><title>Flashbacks</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/flashbacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/flashbacks/</guid><description>So far, our narrative structures have been linear. This is fine, because almost all stories are linear. We simply start when the story becomes interesting, follow the hero through time (chronologically), then end when the story is over.</description></item><item><title>Setup &amp; Payoff</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/setup-and-payoff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/setup-and-payoff/</guid><description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a narrative structure. It&amp;rsquo;s a very simple idea that you&amp;rsquo;ll probably use many times in any story you write.</description></item><item><title>Plot Twists</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/plot-twists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/plot-twists/</guid><description>Many writers have heard about the infamous &amp;ldquo;mystery boxes&amp;rdquo; from J.J. Abrams. They also know countless examples of stories that thought they were being clever by adding a big &amp;ldquo;plot twist&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;surprise revelation&amp;rdquo;, but were actually being dumb and ruining their own story.</description></item><item><title>Mystery Boxes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/mystery-boxes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/mystery-boxes/</guid><description>Previous chapter talked about plot twists and introduced the idea of &amp;ldquo;surprising readers&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; in the wrong way. This chapter talks more about mysteries and revelations.</description></item><item><title>In Media Res</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/in-media-res/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/in-media-res/</guid><description>I remember being taught the concept of &amp;ldquo;in media res&amp;rdquo; at elementary school. Unfortunately, it was taught badly. Many people know the word, but have a somewhat useless understanding of the concept.</description></item><item><title>Dialogue Deep Dive</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/dialogue-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/dialogue-deep-dive/</guid><description>When I submitted my first story to a publisher, I received the feedback that there was way too much dialogue.</description></item><item><title>Description Deep Dive</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/description-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/description-deep-dive/</guid><description>Previous chapter was all about dialogue. This one will be about the other thing you can do with your writing: description.</description></item><item><title>Fichtean Curve</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/fichtean-curve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/fichtean-curve/</guid><description>The Fichtean curve is a slight variation on the 3 Act Structure, which is very common in fantasy and sci-fi novels, or longer &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo; stories in general.</description></item><item><title>Seven-Point Story Structure</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/seven-point-story-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/seven-point-story-structure/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve moved this structure near the end of the course. Not because it&amp;rsquo;s terribly difficult&amp;mdash;I mean, you already know it only has seven points&amp;mdash;but because I never knew what to make of it.</description></item><item><title>Archetypes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/archetypes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/archetypes/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve done many chapters with structures that mostly determine your plot. So let&amp;rsquo;s do another challenge that&amp;rsquo;s all about character!</description></item><item><title>Personality Test</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/personality-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/personality-test/</guid><description>Another chapter to help you write amazing characters. There&amp;rsquo;s this personality test that is used in professional settings because its results are quite accurate and useful.</description></item><item><title>Interactive Stories</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/interactive-stories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/interactive-stories/</guid><description>Besides being a writer, I am a game developer. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in &amp;ldquo;interactive stories&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Different Lenses: Tone</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/different-lenses-tone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/different-lenses-tone/</guid><description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been writing stories in the traditional way. There&amp;rsquo;s a narrator, it describes the events and the dialogue, and maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a hint of &amp;ldquo;writing style&amp;rdquo; or personality.</description></item><item><title>Different Lenses: Media</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/different-lenses-media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/different-lenses-media/</guid><description>As promised, this chapter is about different (general) ways in which you can tell a story. I am very interested in this and will probably do more of it in the future.</description></item><item><title>The Four Seasons</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-seasons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-seasons/</guid><description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a structure, but more of a challenge based on some interesting ideas. We&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of this course, which means I think you&amp;rsquo;re ready for longer and more complicated ideas.</description></item><item><title>Beat Sheet</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/beat-sheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/beat-sheet/</guid><description>Maybe you thought that the narrative structures discussed thus far were too limiting for your creativity. Well, then I have bad news for you.</description></item><item><title>The Final Boss</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-final-boss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-final-boss/</guid><description>Honestly, this course could go on and on. There are infinitely many ideas about what a story should look like, how you could tell it, from big frameworks to tiny tips that might help in specific scenes.</description></item><item><title>Finishing a Story</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/finishing-a-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/finishing-a-story/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve written the first version of your story. (Or you&amp;rsquo;re ~80% through that first draft.) What are some tips for finishing a story?</description></item><item><title>Mindset</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/mindset/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/mindset/</guid><description>Writing stories is hard. It&amp;rsquo;s a really complex task that requires you to imagine whole worlds, characters, and sequences of events from nothing.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/conclusion/</guid><description>Congratulations! You have reached the end of the storytelling course. If you followed along, you&amp;rsquo;ll have written more than 20 unique (short) stories.</description></item></channel></rss>
