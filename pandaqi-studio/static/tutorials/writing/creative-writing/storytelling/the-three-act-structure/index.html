One that is mentioned absolutely everywhere, although I like the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; version more than the simplified one.</p><h2 id=the-3-act-structure>The 3 Act Structure</h2><p>This is the common structure mentioned in most writing guides. It&rsquo;s also vague to the point of being useless. Here&rsquo;s the idea.</p><p>You divide your story into three acts: beginning, middle and end.</p><ul><li><strong>Act 1</strong>: the setup, status quo, exposition. It should contain the &ldquo;inciting incident&rdquo; (the extraordinary event that definitely puts the story in motion) somewhere.</li><li><strong>Act 2</strong>: the meat of the story, in which you slowly build towards &mldr;</li><li><strong>Act 3</strong>: the climax. The biggest, coolest scene in which all conflicts are finally resolved. Afterward, the story cools down until it reaches the end.</li></ul><p>This gives a nice sense of an <em>overall arc</em> to the story. You start slow and simple, then something weird happens and tension ramps up. The story keeps going faster, with tensions rising, until it is all <em>released</em> in the climax.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of the (simple) 3 Act Structure for storytelling.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=three_act_structure_simple.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of the (simple) 3 Act Structure for storytelling." title="Visualization of the (simple) 3 Act Structure for storytelling." width=1385 height=700></picture></figure></p><p>Throughout this course, when I present such an image, the line represents <strong>conflict</strong> (or stakes/tension). As the line rises, the stakes increase and the conflict becomes more tough.</p><h2 id=the-advanced-structure>The Advanced Structure</h2><p>The three acts, as described above, are very vague and not that helpful. They merely tell you that &ldquo;stories should start simple, ramp up as they go, until they reach a climax with the biggest event&rdquo;. As you try to fill in the gaps, you can easily make the wrong assumptions.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Beginning writers often see that Act 1 is called &ldquo;exposition&rdquo; or &ldquo;setup&rdquo;, and think they can fill the whole thing with just <em>information</em>. They&rsquo;ll happily tell you facts about the world and the characters for 10 chapters, before Act 1 is over and they finally start with the story. Obviously, this is NOT the way! The story should start and get interesting immediately.</p></div><p>As such, I&rsquo;d rather tell you the advanced structure with a bit more detail.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of the (advanced) 3 Act Structure for storytelling.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=three_act_structure_advanced.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of the (advanced) 3 Act Structure for storytelling." title="Visualization of the (advanced) 3 Act Structure for storytelling." width=1385 height=700></picture></figure></p><h3 id=act-1-setup>Act 1: Setup</h3><ul><li><strong>Exposition</strong>: establish the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;. What does the ordinary world look like? What&rsquo;s normal for our character?</li><li><strong>Inciting Incident</strong>: the event that sets the story in motion. It&rsquo;s the extraordinary thing that <strong>interrupts</strong> the status quo.</li><li><strong>Plot Point 1</strong>: the hero finally decides to go for it. They &ldquo;cross the threshold&rdquo; and cannot go back to the status quo anymore. We are now in Act 2.</li></ul><p>Note how the inciting incident is an <em>interruption</em>. It can&rsquo;t just be a weird event, or something interesting, and the hero can <em>continue living as they always would</em>. It needs to interrupt the status quo in such a way that the hero just cannot continue like usual. It&rsquo;s an extraordinary interruption.</p><p>The difference between &ldquo;inciting incident&rdquo; and &ldquo;plot point 1&rdquo; is often misunderstood or simply not known to beginning storytellers. They think that Act 1 should be really short: you have your first chapter, it ends with the inciting incident, and boom we&rsquo;re in Act 2.</p><p>In reality, Act 1 should be roughly 25% of the story, Act 2 50%, and Act 3 the last 25%.</p><p>There&rsquo;s this period between &ldquo;something happens&rdquo; and &ldquo;the hero must leave home to fight it&rdquo;. This period is used to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Give more exposition, but in a fun and natural way. (You can <em>show</em> the character of the hero by how they try to ignore the problem the first time.)</li><li>Set up elements that might be used (&ldquo;paid off&rdquo;) later in the story.</li><li>Show that this <em>really</em> upsets the status quo. If something happened, and the hero was immediately like &ldquo;yeah, cool, I&rsquo;ll deal with that&rdquo;, it&rsquo;d feel like the event wasn&rsquo;t significant. The reluctance, the refusal, the difficulty with accepting the obstacle is a crucial part of the 3 act structure.</li></ul><p>In this structure, the hero always &ldquo;ignores&rdquo; the problem at first. You can get creative with the reasons why. (Maybe they think they first need to &ldquo;prepare&rdquo;. Maybe they think they can get away with minimal effort and continue their old life. Maybe they&rsquo;re just arrogant, or insecure, or they have family ties keeping them back.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Take &ldquo;The Hobbit&rdquo;. It starts with Bilbo being visited by Gandalf and asked to go on an adventure. He refuses. We spend a bit more time explaining his (boring) life and the status quo, until he finally decides he <em>does</em> want to go on an adventure.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when Act 1 ends. Due to this structure, we have a better picture of Bilbo and the world before the adventure kicks off. Which of the two events is the inciting incident? I&rsquo;d say the first, some writers might say the second.</p></div><h3 id=act-2-confrontation>Act 2: Confrontation</h3><ul><li><strong>Rising Action</strong>: the hero grows familiar with their new world. They might solve the initial obstacle, but a new one is put in front, bigger than the previous. They do some good things (like getting allies or minor victories), they do some bad things.</li><li><strong>Midpoint</strong>: an event, halfway the story, that completely changes the trajectory. It upends the hero&rsquo;s mission and makes the latter half of the story decidedly different.</li><li><strong>Plot Point 2</strong>: after this world-shaking midpoint, the hero gets their biggest test and fails it. We move into Act 3.</li></ul><p>The &ldquo;rising&rdquo; part is important here. Solving one obstacle, just to see it replaced by a similar one, isn&rsquo;t interesting. Do this for a full novel, and nobody reaches the end.</p><p>Obstacles need to be followed by <em>bigger</em> obstacles. The tension <em>generally</em> rises all the way through Act 2, although it can fluctuate between moments of triumph and moments of great loss.</p><h3 id=act-3-resolution>Act 3: Resolution</h3><ul><li><strong>Pre-Climax</strong>: also called the &ldquo;dark night of the soul&rdquo;. This is the deepest point for our hero, in which they just had their biggest failure, and have to look in the mirror and see what they&rsquo;re made of. They must pull themselves together and find a plan to get out of this hole.</li><li><strong>Climax</strong>: the hero faces their enemy, their biggest obstacle, one last time. This is usually the biggest scene, with all story lines converging, and everything you&rsquo;ve set up during the book being paid off.</li><li><strong>Denouement</strong>: the story quickly tries to get down from its highest point. All loose ends are tied up, the consequences of the climax are discussed, and finally a <strong>new</strong> status quo is established.</li></ul><p>If you set up everything well, the climax will follow quite naturally and will not be the biggest issue. In fact, you can make this a rule.</p><blockquote><p>There should be no NEW information in act 3.</p></blockquote><p>Everything has already been set up. Act 3 simply means the hero finally <em>understands</em> all the information correctly, combines it, and acts on it to reach the climax.</p><p>The denouement is the great test of your story. If you find that <em>nothing has really changed</em> &mldr; then your story has failed. If your hero just goes back home, having learned nothing, having lost nothing, and home is the same as always &mldr; then what was the point of the whole story?</p><p>Yes, events in real life are often pointless. Stories are meant to be a &ldquo;more interesting&rdquo; reality, in which everything has meaning and consequence. People want there to be a point to it all. They want the hero to return home, but home is different, and the hero is different.</p><h2 id=now-write-this>Now write this!</h2><p>If you like planning more, plan the parts of the 3 Act structure ahead of time. Once you have a clear outline, write that story.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re more of an improviser (like me), only come up with the first parts (exposition and inciting incident), then write. See where it takes you. <em>After</em> writing it, go over the story and edit it to fit the structure more tightly. We&rsquo;re here to <em>learn</em>, not to provide a perfect story first try.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>As I said, you can try to &ldquo;keep the structure in mind&rdquo; while writing, but you just &mldr; can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s too much. It blocks you, leads to doubt. While writing, only think about putting the story on paper. Use the phases before and after to edit it towards the structure.</p></div><p>Now let&rsquo;s up the number of acts from 3 to 4 &mldr;</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/narrative-structure/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Narrative Structure</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/the-four-act-structure/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>The 4 Act Structure</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
