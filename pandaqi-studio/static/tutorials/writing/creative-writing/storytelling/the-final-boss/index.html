There are infinitely many ideas about what a story should look like, how you could tell it, from big frameworks to tiny tips that might help in specific scenes.</p><p>But if you&rsquo;ve made it this far, actually writing that story for each chapter (or most of them), you really don&rsquo;t need more. You&rsquo;ve seen the basic blocks of story time and time again. You have ~20 stories written, each with different approaches, which makes you more than qualified as a writer.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I will end the course here. This final chapter is about <em>combining</em> all the experience you&rsquo;ve gathered. Next chapter is about finishing the story (ending, editing, publishing, etcetera) and then finally a short conclusion.</p><h2 id=creativity-is-mixing-and-matching>Creativity is mixing and matching</h2><p>People like to think that creativity is this magical process in which our brain invents stuff from thin air. It&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m sorry. Creativity is just &ldquo;mixing and matching&rdquo; ideas we&rsquo;ve seen before.</p><p>This whole course is basically &ldquo;but what if hero&rsquo;s journey?&rdquo; repeated over and over. There are millions of stories following this structure, but still those stories aren&rsquo;t all the same. Similarly, there are countless tragic characters, dystopian novels, characters who learn the same life lesson&mdash;but we keep inventing new stories.</p><p>Because stories are just a combination of parts that have already been done; it&rsquo;s the <em>combination</em> that&rsquo;s unique.</p><p>Do not worry if a part of your novel is directly inspired by another. In fact, I recommend reading books, watching the news, playing games, precisely <em>because</em> they will inspire you. They will regularly show you something that makes you think &ldquo;that&rsquo;s awesome, I&rsquo;m stealing that&rdquo;</p><p>The creativity is in the combination. You combine different personality traits in the same character. You combine one character on a hero&rsquo;s journey, with another following a tragedy, with another who is mostly comic relief. You create a setting that&rsquo;s partly inspired by this one place on earth, and partly by this other place on earth.</p><h2 id=so-whats-the-final-boss>So what&rsquo;s the final boss?</h2><p>The final boss is being able to write an epic story (many storylines, big world, maybe many <em>books</em> in the series). And to do so, you simply &ldquo;mix and match&rdquo; all the ideas about storytelling in your head.</p><p>The creative part is in which elements you pick and how you develop them.</p><p>The skillful part is in having the experience to pick the <em>right</em> elements, knowing they can be combined in a <em>good</em> way.</p><p>That is, to me, what <em>storytelling</em> is.</p><ul><li>Having the experience and intuition</li><li>To pick characters, plots, events, arcs on the fly</li><li>That you know how to combine</li><li>And which will naturally lead to an interesting and creative story</li></ul><p>You have all the pieces. You have narrative structures, characters, experience writing them down.</p><p>Now you just need to combine different pieces in different ways. Every book, again and again. And if you&rsquo;re particularly successful, your combination of pieces might even become a new &ldquo;piece&rdquo; that writing courses will teach twenty years from now.</p><h2 id=now-write>Now write!</h2><p>This isn&rsquo;t a small challenge anymore. This isn&rsquo;t a short story or something to apply to a throwaway idea.</p><p>I think you&rsquo;re ready to write serious novels for professional publication now.</p><ul><li>Before you start to write, build a strong plan. (As much as you need or want.) Pick an overall structure for the story. Pick good characters which follow their own little arc or mini-story. Design your ideas to lead to good conflict and challenges to the <em>flaws</em> of the characters. <strong>Only pick the structures and tools that are most useful to this story idea.</strong></li><li>Then write your heart out. Trust the experience you&rsquo;ve build. When doubts come, when you feel you hit a wall, ignore them. Keep writing. If needed, cling to an outline or beat sheet, if that helps you get through a slump.</li><li>When done, put the story away for a while (at least a month). Then edit it to make sure the arcs and structures you planned <em>actually come through in the final story</em>. If not, rewrite and tighten up.</li></ul><p>You do not need to know exactly how your story goes (before you start writing). That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain. Practicing all these &ldquo;narrative structures&rdquo; should give you an intuitive sense of storytelling. Without writing down a very detailed outline, your head will automatically know the right thing to do. It will know &ldquo;this character should do X, which could lead to a tragedy arc&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel like we should have a big action scene right about now&rdquo;.</p><p>You write scenes that make sense and lead to a cool finale <em>without conscious effort</em>. If people ask you &ldquo;how did you design such a cool sequence of events?&rdquo;, your response should be to shrug and say &ldquo;it felt like the right thing to do&rdquo;.</p><p>To me, that&rsquo;s the craft and the art of storytelling.</p><p>With each story you write, with each tool you give a try, this storytelling intuition in your head grows. So, whatever happens, <em>keep telling stories</em> and keep <em>challenging yourself with new structures and ideas</em>.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/beat-sheet/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Beat Sheet</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/finishing-a-story/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Finishing a Story</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
