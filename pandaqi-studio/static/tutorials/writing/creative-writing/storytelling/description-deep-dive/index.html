This one will be about the <em>other</em> thing you can do with your writing: description.</p><p>I picked dialogue first because I believe it is more important to practice and get right. As stated, scripts (for film/tv/theatre) are almost entirely dialogue, and even novels are trending in that direction as well. It&rsquo;s something very natural to humans, which means it&rsquo;s easy to write <em>bad</em> dialogue that runs your scene.</p><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve practiced that, we move to a challenge about description. Whilst dialogue has always come naturally to me, I&rsquo;ve struggled heavily with description. When I was a kid, I remember a big writing website (from the Netherlands) where you could send in questions about writing, and I asked: &ldquo;my stories never have any description, how on earth do I do that?!&rdquo;</p><p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve found a type of challenge that helps practice this.</p><h2 id=what-is-description>What is description?</h2><p>Simply put, it&rsquo;s everything except dialogue. You, the narrator of the story, describe the events taking place, describe the surroundings and what things look like, describe the smells and the feelings.</p><p>For some, there&rsquo;s another distinction between &ldquo;action&rdquo; and &ldquo;description&rdquo;.</p><p>I get where they&rsquo;re coming from. It does <em>feel</em> different. I never struggled so much with writing action scenes or simple events happening within the plot, while I struggled with describing the <em>landscape</em> around the characters (for example). One of them is &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; (and vital to the plot and the story), the other is &ldquo;static&rdquo; (it just tells you what things are, what they look like, etcetera).</p><p>In the end, however, both of these are the same thing. It&rsquo;s your job to put a clear image of the situation in the head of your reader. It&rsquo;s your job to succinctly describe the most interesting or useful parts of the story, be it action or be it the details of an important location in your fantasy world.</p><h2 id=the-short-rules>The short rules</h2><p>For more details, you can read the course on <a href=../../prose/>Prose</a> and maybe the one one<a href=../../worldbuilding>Worldbuilding</a>.</p><p>Below is a short, practical summary for this challenge.</p><p><strong>Rule 1: description slows down.</strong> Even short action-packed sentences are slower than leaving out the sentences entirely. In general, however, description is used at <em>slow</em> moments in the plot. They are often longer sentences and paragraphs, devoted to painting a picture. Every plot needs slow moments to &ldquo;catch your breath&rdquo;, and they usually come after one or more fast and action-packed chapters.</p><p>You do <em>not</em> want to spend a few paragraphs describing some object while in the middle of a fast fight scene. It&rsquo;s important to learn the timing of description: when to use it to its full effect, and when to shut up.</p><p><strong>Rule 2: don&rsquo;t just describe facts, describe emotion.</strong> As always, description needs a <em>purpose</em>, a <em>reason</em>. Many writers will simply list a bunch of facts about an object or location. Yes, you&rsquo;ve immersed the reader a bit more, given them more tools to paint a mental picture. But <em>why</em> are you telling these facts? Why does it matter that the couch is brown, the windows stained, and the house vaguely smells like lemon tea?</p><p>Use description to point out only details that matter to the character telling the story. They pick up on certain details <em>because</em> they are interested in them, based on their character. You describe details about what the house looks like <em>because</em> it reminds the character of their childhood home. You describe that couch <em>because</em> it plays a role later in the story.</p><p>Instead of listing facts, find a few details that <em>matter</em> and describe them with <em>emotion</em>.</p><p>A character that walks into a room and notices how much it feels like their childhood home (of which they have fond memories), is stronger than a character walking into that room and merely listing the colors and shapes of a few objects.</p><h2 id=now-write>Now write</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the interesting challenge.</p><blockquote><p>Write a story in which you follow one (or multiple) <strong>locations</strong>, not <strong>people</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, all chapters happen at the same location(s). Their interior, details, history, it&rsquo;s all vital to the plot. It is absolutely forbidden to move to somewhere else or to follow a character around!</p><p>Of course, you still need a plot to happen. So people will visit the location, events will happen inside it (which might change it), etcetera. But because the locations are most important, you&rsquo;ll have little dialogue and much more description.</p><p>This is probably the hardest challenge (or &ldquo;narrative structure&rdquo;) yet. It causes you to rethink everything you thought you knew about stories. But it&rsquo;s certainly possible, if you get creative and try it.</p><p>You can do the same thing in other ways. Maybe one of these is easier for you to try.</p><ul><li>Write a story in which you follow <strong>objects</strong>. (The objects might change hands, play roles in important events, be broken or repaired. But in any case, lots of description going on!)</li><li>Write a story focused on one <strong>property</strong> of people (jobs, clothes, hobbies, &mldr;) In other words, the reader needs to be able to follow the story merely by reading strong, emotional descriptions of such properties. (Try to get a big plot twist in there because somebody suddenly wears different clothes.)</li></ul><p>Descriptions are very much something you can <strong>improve later</strong>. Even if a description is <em>vital</em> to the plot, you can often change a few details without needing to change anything else in your story.</p><p>Therefore, do not think too much about the descriptions while writing. You can always go back later and make them more emotional, more efficient, less fact-based.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/dialogue-deep-dive/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Dialogue Deep Dive</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/storytelling/fichtean-curve/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Fichtean Curve</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
