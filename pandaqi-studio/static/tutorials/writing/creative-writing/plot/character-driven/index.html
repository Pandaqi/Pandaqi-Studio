This chapter does something similar, but now your plot is driven by <strong>character</strong>. The idea remains equally simple.</p><ul><li>Invent a <strong>character</strong>. Give them traits, beliefs, backstory, really <em>know</em> who they are.</li><li>Throw some event at them that challenges their character as much as possible.</li><li>From now on, in every scene, ask yourself &ldquo;what choice would this character make?&rdquo; Then simply write that as your plot!</li></ul><p>Some writers naturally focus more on character. They&rsquo;ll find this challenge very easy to do: get inside the head of your hero, make the decision they&rsquo;d make (all the time).</p><p>Others, whose talents lie elsewhere, will severely struggle with this. You have to turn off any other &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of plot, any narrative structures, any ideas about &ldquo;oh no we need to have a climax now&rdquo; or &ldquo;oh no we need a bad guy&rdquo;. You have to focus entirely on your hero and let them do whatever feels logical for them to do.</p><p>Most successful stories are a middle-ground. Yes, great (and consistent) characters are necessary to get audiences really invested. But good plot is equally necessary to hook them and take them on a fun journey. Just watching a character sit around, thinking, having some disagreements, for a whole story is not exciting.</p><h2 id=an-example>An example</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s say my hero, a young woman,</p><ul><li>Loves food and everything related to it</li><li>Heavily values romantic relationships, to the point of always trying to be in one</li><li>Hates it when people abuse power and doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with it. (As such, she does not care one tiny bit about her <em>own</em> reputation.)</li></ul><p>What&rsquo;s a first scene that would challenge her? Maybe her current partner breaks up with them. Maybe she is suddenly thrust into a position of power, where upholding reputation is important, for which she wasn&rsquo;t prepared. Maybe she discovers some health issue that means she can&rsquo;t eat as much food as she used to. (Maybe <em>all of them</em> with one event, if you feel up to the task.)</p><p>Once you have it, you&rsquo;re off to the races.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s pick the first one. The hero lost her (romantic) relationship, and now they feel lost and lonely. What would she decide to do? Immediately, perhaps obsessively, seek out a new partner. She decides to try dating apps.</p><p>She meets someone on such an app. They propose to meet up in real life. What does the hero decide? Obviously, she says <em>yes</em>, and she picks a fancy and expensive restaurant with the best food.</p><p>While on that date, a very powerful person (maybe the major of the city) also dines there. She overhears their squabbling about power and reputation. Maybe she discovers a lie they&rsquo;re telling everyone to cover up a terrible situation, just to maintain their reputation. What does the hero decide? She is infuriated and challenges them immediately, embarrassing herself and basically everyone there.</p><p>Her date, whom she liked quite a lot, is upset by this and leaves. What does she decide to do?</p><p>The cycle goes on and on. At every point, consider the traits and flaws of your character, then let them do the thing that feels most logical and true.</p><h2 id=now-write>Now write!</h2><p>Write a completely character-driven story. You need a strong idea of who your character is, but there&rsquo;s no reason to be extremely detailed. (As you saw in the example above, just a few bullet points can be enough.)</p><p>It&rsquo;s not allowed to invent plot for any other reason than &ldquo;this is what the character would do or decide&rdquo;! (If you add multiple characters, do the same for the other characters. Whenever reasonable, have them influence the plot by making a choice that&rsquo;s logical for <em>them</em>.)</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not used to really considering characters while plotting, this might be an eye-opening experiment.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-points-and-turns/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Plot Points & Turns</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/play-with-timing/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Play with Timing</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
