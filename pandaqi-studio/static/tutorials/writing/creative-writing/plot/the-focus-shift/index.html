This causes me to put <em>way too much</em> into my stories. I usually had multiple storylines, each chapter following a different one, which come together near the end.</p><p>When I first received feedback about this, I was taken aback. I knew <em>plenty</em> stories that were far more complicated, which had far more going on, but were <em>not</em> deemed &ldquo;too complicated&rdquo; or &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo;. What was the difference?</p><p>The answer, so I&rsquo;ve learned, is <strong>focus</strong>.</p><h2 id=what-does-it-mean>What does it mean?</h2><p>Instead of switching between completely different storylines, stay <em>focused</em> on one storyline for a longer period. A chapter, multiple chapters, maybe a whole section of the book. Once you&rsquo;re done with it, <em>switch the focus</em> (in its entirety) to the other storyline.</p><p>When plotting, try to <em>group</em> related events or concepts into the same chapter. Invent a way to allow every chapter to <em>focus</em> completely on one aspect of your character, setting or plot. Once chapters start to focus on multiple things at a time, you&rsquo;ve lost the reader. (Even if each thing, on its own, is quite simple and easy to understand.)</p><p>This all combines into what I call the <strong>focus shift</strong>. To keep a complex story easy to follow,</p><ul><li>Stay focused on the same general concept for a longer period of time</li><li>And once you&rsquo;re done with it, <em>shift</em> to a new focus entirely.</li></ul><p>In practice, this means you&rsquo;ll have at most a handful of focus shifts, even for very long (fantasy) novels.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You have two storylines. One takes place at location A, the other at location B a great distance away. In earlier stories, I&rsquo;d do a quick chapter at A, then a quick chapter at B, then one at A again, and so forth until the end.</p><p>With this approach, you&rsquo;d <em>stay</em> at location A for a longer time. For multiple chapters, you experience the height of the action there and the most important events are <em>shown</em>. Then, you shift entirely to location B. For multiple chapters, you are focused entirely on the other location.</p></div><p>It will take some practice to find if you <em>need</em> to do this shift, and <em>when</em> you want to do it. But once I realized this, my stories became far easier to follow, and I noticed this in other popular novels.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>For example, I know several fantasy novels that <em>do</em> switch constantly between story A and story B (after each chapter). However, if a MAJOR event happens at A, they <em>stay</em> at A for a few chapters. It&rsquo;s a simple timing thing that makes a story much easier to follow. (Additionally, if you have really long chapters, you already have proper focus and can switch after each chapter.)</p></div><h2 id=the-midpoint-twist>The midpoint twist</h2><p>This is a related idea that I&rsquo;ve found equally powerful.</p><p>The middle of a story is the place that often gets <em>muddled</em> and <em>lacking direction</em>. It&rsquo;s often dubbed the &ldquo;muddy middle&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sagging middle&rdquo;. To combat this, most popular stories use a simple trick: the midpoint twist.</p><blockquote><p>Exactly halfway your story, place a MAJOR event that completely changes the trajectory of the story.</p></blockquote><p>As with any event, it should be <em>set up</em>. It shouldn&rsquo;t come out of left field or feel random. Nor should it be the most climactic event of your story: afterwards, action should still be rising, towards your actual climax near the end.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s a big twist. Something that breaks the story in two pieces. And those two pieces should be related, but significantly <em>different</em>.</p><p>Once I learned this, I have <em>always</em> planned a midpoint twist in all my stories. And it has worked every time.</p><p>And <em>how</em> do you plot a midpoint twist? Well, by using a focus shift!</p><ul><li>Up until now, the hero has been pursuing a certain goal, focused on that.</li><li>The midpoint twist should turn that upside-down, giving the hero a slightly <em>altered</em> goal to focus on from now on!</li></ul><p>Often, this is accompanied by that literal focus shift I explained above: something major happens at the midpoint, creating an interesting cliffhanger &mldr; and then we cut away, continuing the story focused on something else.</p><h3 id=example-saga-of-life>Example: Saga of Life</h3><p>One of my ongoing projects is the Saga of Life. I aim to write 10 short stories for it every year. Each of them has exactly 10 chapters, and I apply the midpoint twist around chapter 5 and 6.</p><p>One story, for example, is about farm animals who are treated badly and aim to escape the farm. The first chapters build towards that escape attempt (setting it up, planning, &mldr;). When do they attempt the escape? You guessed it: chapter 5.</p><p>They fail. That has consequences: the daughter of the farm owner now knows what they&rsquo;re doing. So, from now on, the focus has changed slightly. They still want to escape, but the rules have changed and completely different obstacles are in play. (Some animals think the daughter will help and think she&rsquo;s an essential part of the plan, others have a deep distrust towards <em>humans</em> and don&rsquo;t want any of this.)</p><p>Now imagine that story <em>without</em> the midpoint twist. What would be happening around chapter 5 and 6? The animals would &mldr; still be looking for a way to escape. The reader has now been reading about animals <em>planning</em> to do something for 6 chapters, and nothing has happened yet! Once they actually escape, near the end, it won&rsquo;t feel satisfying. It would feel like the predictable ending that should&rsquo;ve come much sooner.</p><p>Hence the &ldquo;saggy middle&rdquo; that feels boring and lacking focus. Use the midpoint twist to hook the reader back into the story, before they start to drift off.</p><h2 id=now-write>Now write!</h2><p>Pick an idea that has multiple storylines (or multiple clearly separated locations/concepts/mysteries). Now write that story, keeping in mind the focus shift and the midpoint twist.</p><ul><li>Design your plot so that chapters can focus entirely on one thing.</li><li>When something important (or complex) happens at a storyline, stay focused on it for a little longer, and only <em>then</em> completely shift focus to another storyline.</li><li>Around the midpoint of your story, place a HUGE event that shakes up the hero&rsquo;s world. An event that breaks the story in two parts (before the midpoint and after the midpoint) which feel clearly different.</li></ul><p>This challenge is especially useful if you write longer (fantasy) novels, or have the tendency to overcomplicate stories (like me).</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/play-with-timing/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Play with Timing</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/death-in-every-scene/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Death in Every Scene</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
