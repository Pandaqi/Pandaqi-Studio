You promise the reader what it&rsquo;s going to be like. But what is it exactly? How do you construct a good promise? You obviously don&rsquo;t want to give away too much and spoil the story.</p><h2 id=a-good-promise>A good promise</h2><p>A strong promise usually includes the following elements.</p><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong>: is it generally happy or dark? Is it funny or serious? Is there a clear <em>voice</em> narrating the story?</li><li><strong>Theme</strong>: what kinds of conflict or goals will be at the center of this story? (If your first chapter introduces somebody eager to travel the world, and the rest of the story takes place at one and the same location &mldr; that&rsquo;s going to feel unsatisfying.)</li><li><strong>Character (Arc)</strong>: introduce your hero and <em>hint</em> towards what might be missing in their life or how they might change. (Not fully, not detailed, but a small hint. People read it and subconsciously think &ldquo;hmm, I hope this character learns to salvage their relationship with their parents&rdquo;. If the book delivers <em>that</em>, it feels really good.)</li><li><strong>Plot (Type)</strong>: plots can be categorized in general types. (For example, everybody knows what a &ldquo;detective story&rdquo; is. If your book is a murder mystery, clearly signal that in the first few paragraphs! This way, readers know what they&rsquo;re in for.)</li></ul><p>You will make these promises whether you want to or not. So it&rsquo;s better to take control and make promises on purpose.</p><p>Promises are <em>not</em> the place where you break rules or try to be &ldquo;surprising&rdquo;. In fact, err on the side of being predictable, as it makes the promise easier to understand and execute.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The novel called &ldquo;They Both Die At The End&rdquo; would have sucked if they did <strong>not</strong> both die at the end. No matter how &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or &ldquo;surprising&rdquo; you might initially think that would be.</p></div><p>As mentioned, most plots have already been done. So, where would you get a new promise? Where would you get new story ideas? A good way to generate a promise is to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Either take a new spin on a familiar idea</li><li>Or mash two familiar ideas together</li></ul><p>And you don&rsquo;t need to be coy about it. If you&rsquo;re inspired by heist movies, clearly promise a heist story in your first chapter, using all the tropes and genre trappings available. But also invent one <em>twist</em>, one reason you&rsquo;re telling this <em>new</em> heist story, and clearly signal <em>that</em> as soon as possible.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Later in this course, I introduce the basic plot types that cover almost all plots. Check out <a href=../plot-archetypes-i/>Plot Archetypes I</a>.</p></div><h2 id=the-broken-heart-promise>The broken heart promise</h2><p>This is the most common issue for beginning writers. The thought process is understandable.</p><ul><li>What if I write a book that mixes genres A and B?</li><li>They write <em>half</em> the book as genre A.</li><li>And the other <em>half</em> as genre B.</li></ul><p>For example: what if I write a detective &mldr; that&rsquo;s also a romance!?</p><p>Promises are always made in the first chapter(s). As such, every reader picking up the book, assumes this to be a detective. When it turns into a romance, they&rsquo;ll be disappointed and most likely stop reading. (Conversely, those who enjoy romance will never pick up the book, because the first chapter clearly promises a detective.)</p><p>I call that the Broken Heart Promise. It breaks one story into two stories that should&rsquo;ve been separate books. (It also often happens when the writer doubts themselves halfway, or gets bored, and pivots the story into a new direction.)</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t do this!</strong> If you mash multiple genres or ideas, promise <em>all</em> of them (a tiny bit) in the first chapter. If that is too much, your idea is too complicated and you need to cut something.</p><p>In general, with stories, it&rsquo;s better to <em>focus</em>. To pick one theme, one premise, one genre, and commit fully to that. Any reader who sees that and thinks they might like it, will <em>love</em> your book. Any reader who would not enjoy your story anyway, will not pick up the book, as you&rsquo;ve clearly communicated what it is (and what it&rsquo;s not).</p><h2 id=foreshadowing>Foreshadowing</h2><p>Many writers call this &ldquo;promise&rdquo; or this &ldquo;setup&rdquo; (which gets a payoff later!) <strong>foreshadowing</strong>. Good foreshadowing is essential to a satisfying story.</p><p>Think of it this way. There might be some evil person standing behind you this very moment, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know. They cast a shadow, but it&rsquo;s behind them, so you have no clue of the bad things that are about to befall you. When they attack, it is sudden, and you could not have prepared in any way.</p><p>Now imagine the reverse. The evil person stands behind you, but they cast a shadow <em>in front of them</em>. You see the shadow first, <em>then</em> the evil person. This leads to a much more interesting scene, because now you build tension (you see the shadow, you slowly follow it, getting closer and closer to the intruder) and you give the reader a taste of what&rsquo;s about to happen. If you&rsquo;re smart or quick, you might still run away or defend yourself.</p><p>Without foreshadowing, many scenes feel meaningless and random. There were no hints for the hero (or the reader), nothing that might have helped them prepare to fight obstacles. With it, stories get clear meaning and purpose, which is what people seek.</p><p>It&rsquo;s similar to a quote from Hitchcock.</p><p>Imagine a scene with two people talking in a restaurant. They just talk about their day, make some jokes, catch up&mdash;until suddenly a bomb goes off! Yes, it&rsquo;s a shock, but the whole scene before that was boring and did not do anything useful. You didn&rsquo;t know about the bomb and neither did the characters.</p><p>Now imagine <em>showing</em> the audience that there&rsquo;s a bomb under the table. (Or somebody subtly revealing there might be a bomb through dialogue.) You foreshadow that something is about to blow up. As the people make small talk, you&rsquo;re already growing tense. Check under the table! Why don&rsquo;t you look? Why don&rsquo;t they talk about something more important? Are they going to stop the bomb in time?!</p><p>An otherwise boring conversation, suddenly becomes interesting and exciting because you <em>foreshadowed</em>.</p><p>For specific tips on how to actually <em>execute</em> effective foreshadowing, check <a href=../spoilers-versus-foreshadowing/>Spoilers versus Foreshadowing</a>, a chapter near the end of this course.</p><h2 id=inciting-incident>Inciting Incident</h2><p>The inciting incident kicks off your story. As such, the promises you make will always be strongly connected to this incident.</p><p>I think this is another true skill of the writer: coming up with the best possible inciting incident. You have to design a single event that <em>promises all the right things</em>! Come up with a good one, and readers are hooked (and the story much easier to write from now on). Come up with a bad one, and your whole plot fights against it.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Many writers state that they always leave their first chapters for last. Maybe they write something, but they know they&rsquo;re going to scrap that and rewrite the first chapter at the end. Because now that they&rsquo;ve written the whole story, they know what they should <em>promise</em> at the start!</p></div><p>My best definition of this event is &mldr;</p><blockquote><p>An inciting incident should <strong>interrupt</strong> the current situation. (This interruption prompts the <em>reaction</em> that starts the plot cycle I explained earlier.)</p></blockquote><p>Your first chapter has to start with <em>a</em> situation. Usually the daily life of the hero, the current &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;. This is a given: the reader knows nothing of your world, so you <em>have</em> to start somewhere by explaining the current state of the world.</p><p>But remember the promises. You have to promise a character <em>arc</em>. A <em>plot</em> type, and plot moves forward (using that cycle of action and reaction). So you need CHANGE!</p><p>The inciting incident should be that change. It should interrupt your explanation of the current situation, and promise the reader what kind of change will happen in this story.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Many writers use the inciting incident as just a &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; or &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; event. While that often works to hook the reader, it falls flat quickly, as you made the wrong promises.</p><p>If you start the book with a murder, it surely interrupts the status quo, and promises a story of death, intrigue, danger. If nobody else dies, and the change in the story is about the hero learning to overcome their own insecurity, you&rsquo;ve promised the wrong thing.</p><p>The inciting incident should be strongly related to the change and payoff of the whole story.</p></div><h2 id=you-can-do-anything>You can do anything</h2><p>Beginning writers often ask if something &ldquo;can be done&rdquo; or &ldquo;will work&rdquo;. They explain their story idea, which they&rsquo;re very excited about and is very unique, but worry if it&rsquo;s just impossible to execute.</p><p>The answer is simple.</p><blockquote><p>You can do <strong>anything</strong>, as long as you <strong>set it up</strong></p></blockquote><p>As long as you promised you were going to do it, you can do it (in your story). As long as you clearly signaled this might happen, and set up the pieces for it, you can pull the trigger later.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Same with music. A note is only &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; if it doesn&rsquo;t fit with all the other notes. Change the key, and the note is suddenly right.</p><p>The best and most memorable melodies in the world play lots of &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; notes. Why do they work? They lead the reader towards them, by using an intermediate chord, or introducing notes from the other scale at earlier moments.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/promise-progress-payoff/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Promise, Progress, Payoff</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/progress/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Progress</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
