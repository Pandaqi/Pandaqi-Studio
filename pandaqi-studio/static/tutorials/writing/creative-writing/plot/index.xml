It&amp;rsquo;s by far the longest one out of all my courses on creative writing.</description></item><item><title>What is plot?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/what-is-plot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/what-is-plot/</guid><description>For most people, the definition of plot is simply &amp;ldquo;the things that happen&amp;rdquo;. And, honestly, you don&amp;rsquo;t need much more than that.</description></item><item><title>Promise, Progress, Payoff</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/promise-progress-payoff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/promise-progress-payoff/</guid><description>This is the simplest way of thinking about plot that I found practical and useful. The &amp;ldquo;three P&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;: Promise, Progress, Payoff.</description></item><item><title>Promises</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/promises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/promises/</guid><description>As mentioned in the previous chapter, every storyline starts with a promise. You promise the reader what it&amp;rsquo;s going to be like.</description></item><item><title>Progress</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/progress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/progress/</guid><description>Previous chapter taught you how to make great promises at the start of your story. Now you need to progress those promises.</description></item><item><title>Payoff</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/payoff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/payoff/</guid><description>If you created good Promises and Progress, the Payoff should flow naturally. If you get stuck thinking of a &amp;ldquo;cool ending&amp;rdquo; for the story, as if you could just create any ending you want, it reveals you haven&amp;rsquo;t made clear promises and progress.</description></item><item><title>Show versus Tell</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/show-versus-tell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/show-versus-tell/</guid><description>Okay, so you have a plot. You have some events and information to get across. You need to communicate these to the reader, write it down in some way.</description></item><item><title>Conflict</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/conflict/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/conflict/</guid><description>Previous chapter gave you an idea of how to get scenes or chapters out of your plot. How to know which parts you should show, and which you should just tell with a literal sentence.</description></item><item><title>Plot Archetypes I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-i/</guid><description>As mentioned before, most plots have already been done. In fact, if you look at stories from a distance, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that 99% of stories pull from the same collection of plot archetypes.</description></item><item><title>Plot Archetypes II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-ii/</guid><description>The archetypes below are from the popular Save the Cat books. (Read the full book if you want more details, examples, and more.</description></item><item><title>Plot Archetypes III</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-iii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-iii/</guid><description>Credit for this overview of plot archetypes goes to SB Morrison. I debated about including this, because his own article is well-written and it&amp;rsquo;s his work.</description></item><item><title>Plot Archetypes IV</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-iv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-archetypes-iv/</guid><description>As promised, here&amp;rsquo;s my longest list of plot archetypes. Any idea you have can be categorized as one or multiple of these, although it might take a bit more searching.</description></item><item><title>Improv Plotting</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/improv-plotting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/improv-plotting/</guid><description>This technique is one of the first rules of improvisational theatre. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple way to always keep a story going, to always move the plot forward.</description></item><item><title>Opening &amp; Closing Scenes</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/opening-and-closing-scenes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/opening-and-closing-scenes/</guid><description>When I wrote my first stories, I had a funny issue with every chapter. I had no intuition for when to start or end a chapter.</description></item><item><title>Theme-Driven</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/theme-driven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/theme-driven/</guid><description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve focused on plot in a very practical way. The specific events, conflicts, and consequences. This chapter challenges you to write a plot using a different approach: one driven by theme, first and foremost.</description></item><item><title>Plot Points &amp; Turns</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-points-and-turns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/plot-points-and-turns/</guid><description>This is a plotting tool I invented myself, after researching narrative structures for a long time. (You can see the results of all that in my Storytelling course.</description></item><item><title>Character-Driven</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/character-driven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/character-driven/</guid><description>A few chapters ago, we had the theme-driven plot. This chapter does something similar, but now your plot is driven by character.</description></item><item><title>Play with Timing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/play-with-timing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/play-with-timing/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed what should happen in your plot and why. This chapter talks about when events should happen. As a writer, you have the unique ability to move your plot around in time.</description></item><item><title>The Focus Shift</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/the-focus-shift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/the-focus-shift/</guid><description>This is another plotting tool I invented, after writing several stories that were just not good enough and that received feedback from professional editors.</description></item><item><title>Death in Every Scene</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/death-in-every-scene/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/death-in-every-scene/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know the source of this idea, as I learned it long ago. When I did, though, it immediately made my writing much better.</description></item><item><title>Rule of Three</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/rule-of-three/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/rule-of-three/</guid><description>Previous chapter already set up this chapter. I mentioned how stories typically threaten death once or twice before actually going through with it.</description></item><item><title>Folktales</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/folktales/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/folktales/</guid><description>Folktales are a favorite of mine. First of all, I just love those kinds of stories. Secondly, their general structure and themes strike close to the core of storytelling, which allows them to hook any reader.</description></item><item><title>Snapshots Method</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/snapshots-method/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/snapshots-method/</guid><description>Often, when a writer has a story idea, they have these &amp;ldquo;cool moments&amp;rdquo; in their head. They picture a great battle, a surprising betrayal, a wondrous magical event.</description></item><item><title>The Agenda Method</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/the-agenda-method/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/the-agenda-method/</guid><description>This is an amalgamation of several outlining methods that basically say the same thing. This one is for those of us who like planning and outlining, surely not for the improvisers!</description></item><item><title>Serialized versus Episodic</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/serialized-versus-episodic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/serialized-versus-episodic/</guid><description>This chapter is about telling a story in multiple parts. (Such as a book series or multiple episodes for a TV show.</description></item><item><title>Story Ships</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/story-ships/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/story-ships/</guid><description>This is the final &amp;ldquo;plotting tool&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;writing challenge&amp;rdquo; I will give you. After this chapter will be more specific chapters about common mistakes or questions about plotting.</description></item><item><title>First Chapters</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/first-chapters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/first-chapters/</guid><description>This article contains some advice or common mistakes that writers make with their first chapter (or first scene). Most authors, including me, will tell you that the first chapter is absolutely the most important one in your novel.</description></item><item><title>Action I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/action-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/action-i/</guid><description>This article talks about writing simple action in general. How to write the things that happen, both big and small, in your book.</description></item><item><title>Action II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/action-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/action-ii/</guid><description>Last chapter talked about writing simple action sentences. Knowing this, how do we string together a long list of actions for a full sequence?</description></item><item><title>Description</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/description/</guid><description>Description is an odd thing in storytelling. It obviously only applies to books: a visual medium does the describing by simply placing the object or setting in the frame.</description></item><item><title>Emotional versus Melodramatic</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/emotional-versus-melodramatic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/emotional-versus-melodramatic/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about how to write action and how to write description. When it came to action, the action needed to have an emotional foundation, otherwise the reader didn&amp;rsquo;t care.</description></item><item><title>Compelling versus Complicated</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/compelling-versus-complicated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/compelling-versus-complicated/</guid><description>This is probably the hardest balance to strike. If your story is too simple, it feels boring and meaningless.</description></item><item><title>Spoilers versus Foreshadowing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/spoilers-versus-foreshadowing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/spoilers-versus-foreshadowing/</guid><description>Like most, I despise spoilers. Especially in more popular genres, the main draw of a story comes from mystery.</description></item><item><title>How to actually write it</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/how-to-actually-write-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/how-to-actually-write-it/</guid><description>Inventing a great plot is obviously not the same as actually writing it. With words, on the page, to actually put it in book form.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/conclusion/</guid><description>This has probably been my longest course to date. It&amp;rsquo;s easily the longest of all the writing courses. Because, in the end, plot is the actual meat of the book.</description></item><item><title>Writing for target audiences</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/writing-for-target-audiences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/plot/writing-for-target-audiences/</guid><description>This is the final chapter of the course. (The next one is a short conclusion just to wrap things up nicely.</description></item></channel></rss>
