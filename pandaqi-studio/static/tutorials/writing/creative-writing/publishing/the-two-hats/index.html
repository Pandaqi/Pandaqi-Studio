The first hat is obviously the <strong>writer&rsquo;s hat</strong>. You put it on for weeks or months to get that story out and finish the book. The second hat is the <strong>business hat</strong>. That&rsquo;s the one necessary when trying to get your work published and making an income from it.</p><p>These can be the same, but are different 99% of the time. The writer&rsquo;s hat asks you to be creative, to take risks, to experiment, to be free. The business hat asks you to look at the finished book as &ldquo;just another book&rdquo; that a potential customer &ldquo;knows nothing about and isn&rsquo;t interested in (yet)&rdquo;.</p><p>Most people struggle with that, the first few times. I did as well. In fact, I <em>still</em> struggle a lot with the Business Hat.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I generally do not care about money, status, career, or whatever. I also don&rsquo;t like the insincerity that&rsquo;s often pervasive in business. That makes it hard for me to fully put on the Business Hat, even though I know I should.</p></div><p>As such, as you read this course, put on the Business Hat. This is not the time to make any more creative decisions or change the book in a major way. This hat tells you to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Get things done (on time, in the right format).</li><li>View your book as a mere product that needs selling, with no more attachment than that.</li><li>Change whatever is needed to help with marketing and reaching the right target audience.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>When I wrote my first book, it took a <em>long</em> time (like most writers). Because of that time investment, I was also really invested in the book itself and its content.</p><p>That leads to thinking that&rsquo;s terrible for business. I wrote a marketing blurb that was <em>way</em> too long, because I wanted to tell readers about <em>all</em> the amazing things in this book. I spent almost zero time on the cover and marketing anyway, because I thought &ldquo;this story is so good, it can&rsquo;t help but sell itself&rdquo;. When people suggested changes, I was very reluctant to do so. Don&rsquo;t touch my baby!</p><p>I still had my writer&rsquo;s hat on, which led to every possible publishing mistake you could make.</p></div><p>Publishing (or getting published), like all skills, takes practice. You will surely make mistakes with your first book. I recommend using a few throwaway books to get into the habit. Your oldest books, your worst books, whatever. Use those at first, when querying a publisher or trying to self-publish, to get practice and prevent mistakes before they become <em>serious</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>One of my first ebooks (a Dutch novel) has a grayscale cover. This was a mistake! The paperback version has a beautiful color version. What I didn&rsquo;t know, however, was that the system I used at that time would <em>automatically</em> grab the first image from the ebook (usually a grayscale copy of the cover, on the very first page) and make that the cover image.</p><p>A really stupid rule. I&rsquo;m still mad they didn&rsquo;t communicate that. But I lived and I learned, never making that mistake again.</p></div><p>This is maybe a bit controversial advice. Others say you should &ldquo;definitely put your best work forward&rdquo;, otherwise you might taint your reputation. But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p><ul><li>Publishers usually don&rsquo;t accept a manuscript to be sent multiple times. So if it didn&rsquo;t appeal the first time, because you wrote a rubbish synopsis for example, you&rsquo;ve basically lost your chance with that particular publisher.</li><li>When self-publishing, it&rsquo;s usually not allowed (or expensive) to make changes <em>after</em> you hit that big &ldquo;publish!&rdquo; button. If you make mistakes, you&rsquo;re usually screwed.</li></ul><p>Sure, you might be the one person who does everything perfectly the first time (when it comes to publishing). I am too practical and realistic to rely on that, so I suggest using a handful of &ldquo;guinea pigs&rdquo; first. Then, when that amazing book of yours is ready to be published, you&rsquo;ll know exactly how to turn it into a bestseller.</p><p>If it&rsquo;s really bad, you can always just remove your guinea pigs entirely. Most of the time, however, people understand the idea of stepping stones and a writer growing over time.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I once read an interesting article about this. Most people said (paraphrasing): &ldquo;if I like the style and ideas of an author, I always try another book by them. Even if I dislike it, I might read two or three more books before I give up on that author. Conversely, if an author just doesn&rsquo;t match my tastes, I probably won&rsquo;t ever pick up a second book by them.&rdquo;</p><p>As long as you put the effort into making a good book, with <em>your</em> style and <em>your</em> way of storytelling, you will always find an audience that sticks with you. Even through the worse books.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/introduction/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>Introduction</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/how-to-sell-your-work-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>How to Sell your Work I</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
