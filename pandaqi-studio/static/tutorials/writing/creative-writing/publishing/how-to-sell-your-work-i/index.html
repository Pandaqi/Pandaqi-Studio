In doing so, you need to turn your carefully written book into something fit for <em>marketing</em> or <em>selling</em>.</p><p>You can do this afterwards, of course. But I&rsquo;ve learned to do a bit of this beforehand, and to refine it <em>while</em> writing.</p><p>Why? In the end, most stories are hard to sell if you purely focus on the <em>story</em>. When I wrote my first book and crafted a synopsis for it &mldr; I was stumped for <em>days</em>. I had no idea how to sell the actual story I wrote. It had elements from different genres, it had a bit too many storylines, and I didn&rsquo;t even know my own target audience or why they&rsquo;d be interested.</p><p>In order to get a good one-page synopsis, I basically had to ignore half the book and lie about the other half. Not surprisingly, this first book of mine was never accepted by a literary agent or publisher. I had written a story near impossible to sell. At the same time, when I read the synopsis, I thought &ldquo;huh, this is the story I <em>wish</em> I wrote, it sounds way more streamlined&rdquo;.</p><p>See it as an interaction between your <em>story</em> and its <em>marketing</em>. Whenever you want to make a major change to a story, think about how that would work in marketing. Conversely, try to come up with strong marketing ideas, then work those into the actual story.</p><p>Condensing your story into one or two paragraphs that sound <em>interesting</em> and <em>sellable</em> is a great test for your story&rsquo;s commercial potential. If you write the whole story first and only <em>then</em> think about how to sell it to others, you&rsquo;ll probably have a very hard time and need to change large parts.</p><p>This chapter and the next contain key points I try to pin down before I start, and refine as I go.</p><h2 id=the-credits-system>The Credits System</h2><p>This is the best (and most gamified) way I&rsquo;ve found for looking at your book as a product to sell.</p><p>People looking for a book to buy have <strong>one credit</strong> to spend. Just the tiniest sliver of attention and energy to put into learning about your book.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the first thing people see about your book? The cover, then perhaps title or author.</p><p>They spend their one credit studying the cover. If they like it, you&rsquo;ve now earned yourself <strong>three credits</strong>. If they don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re done, that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>With those three credits, they&rsquo;ll read the first few sentences of your marketing blurb. If they like it, you&rsquo;ve now earned yourself <strong>five credits</strong>. If they don&rsquo;t, too bad, that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>With those five credits, they read the full blurb, and perhaps some reviews or other details.</p><p>You get the idea. They like it? More credits for you. They don&rsquo;t? End of the road.</p><p>In the same way,</p><ul><li>A good opening line earns you enough credits for the first paragraph</li><li>A good first paragraph earns you the first page</li><li>A good first page earns you the first chapter</li><li>A good first chapter earns you the first half of the book</li><li>If somebody liked the first half &ldquo;well enough&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ll usually finish the book.</li></ul><p>Your book constantly has to gain trust and attention from a reader. And it must do so from <em>start</em> to <em>finish</em>. A great second chapter of the book is useless if a reader never gives you enough credits to reach it.</p><p>So yes, front load all the good stuff. Put your best foot forward. Make sure you earn the interest and respect of a reader in the first couple of steps, otherwise nobody will end up reading the whole thing.</p><h2 id=target-audience>Target Audience</h2><p>Who is your target audience? You should know this.</p><p>Yes, there are a handful examples of books being written for one audience, then becoming a bestseller with another. But that&rsquo;s all they are: rare exceptions.</p><p>Most books are denied or ignored because people look at them and they just don&rsquo;t know if this book is for <em>them</em>.</p><h3 id=no-book-is-for-everyone>No book is for everyone</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first books. People would ask about the target audience, and I&rsquo;d answer: &ldquo;You know, everyone can enjoy this story!&rdquo;</p><p>Yeah, no. If you use simple language, people who want more compelling prose won&rsquo;t like the book. If you include elements that kids enjoy, adults are likely to find that off-putting.</p><p>No book is for &ldquo;everyone&rdquo;. If you try to reach everybody, you will reach nobody.</p><h3 id=what-to-check>What to check?</h3><p>What comprises a target audience? People usually imagine their &ldquo;perfect reader&rdquo; based on some general characteristics.</p><ul><li>Age</li><li>Gender</li><li>(Cultural) Background</li><li>Genre</li><li>Reading Preferences</li></ul><h3 id=yes-discrimination>Yes, discrimination</h3><p>Some books are clearly labeled as a &ldquo;girls book&rdquo; or a &ldquo;boys book&rdquo;. Similarly, I have entered several writing competitions that clearly stated &ldquo;we write books for <em>women</em>&rdquo;. (Not a single one that said &ldquo;we write books for <em>men</em>&rdquo;, but then again, the statistics on book readers heavily lean towards female.)</p><p>I don&rsquo;t like adding such labels <em>at the front</em>, publicly, as it basically excludes a large part of readers. But for marketing? Yes, this is definitely a thing. Men and women are attracted to different types of books or stories. Some things will sell great when you specifically target a gender, while they would not sell at all if you target both.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same with any other &ldquo;property&rdquo; of your potential reader. I&rsquo;ve read tons of books as an adult that were for kids&mdash;just like I&rsquo;ve read books as a kid that were far above my age. Nothing is <em>stopping</em> you from reading a book not marketed towards you specifically.</p><p>But a book written for little kids will clearly have a different cover, tone, writing style, content and marketing than one for another age group. Similarly, a book might be clearly for girls, or clearly for people from a specific cultural background.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t bad. This is just knowing for whom you&rsquo;re writing the story and how to reach them.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>With my Wildebyte Arcades, I purposely decided <em>not</em> to target teenage boys. Unlike almost all other books about characters being sucked into video games, which clearly copied a popular game with teenage boys at the time of publication. That&rsquo;s the unique thing about <em>my</em> books in this genre: they don&rsquo;t perform this niche targeting.</p><p>In fact, Wildebyte changes into a <em>character</em> from the game into which they fall, so you never even learn the original age or gender of the protagonist. That&rsquo;s a way to make the books appeal more broadly.</p></div><h3 id=reading-preferences>Reading preferences</h3><p>Reading preferences is the hardest one to pin down. Different people like different <em>kinds</em> of stories and different <em>ways</em> of telling them.</p><ul><li>Some people like books to be fast-paced and full of action. Others like to really dig into the main character&rsquo;s thoughts, or to have a calm book filled with description.</li><li>Some people love experimental books (that play with time, formatting, structure). Others really hate that.</li><li>Some people like long chapters. Some despise that or need the short chapters (because they don&rsquo;t have the time for long ones).</li></ul><p>Ask yourself (and any readers around you) how they like to read and what they do or do not enjoy. This should get you a list of possible things people might <em>like</em> or <em>hate</em>. In general, if something can be liked by a group, it can be hated by another group ;)</p><p>Now, as you write the story, keep this in mind. Your book is supposed to be action, action, action? I&rsquo;m afraid you have to remove those 5 pages with description in chapter 4, no matter how well you wrote it.</p><p>When selling, show this. In the marketing blurb, in the cover, in the <em>first chapter</em>, clearly show the type of reading experience this will be. It&rsquo;s like a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; to the reader: this is the type of book you&rsquo;re going to get.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My writing style is very fast, practical and efficient. I personally don&rsquo;t like very slow books or describing things too much. Some people are with me on that, others have called my books &ldquo;like you&rsquo;re out of breath the whole time&rdquo;. Obviously, I still refine my style and listen to criticism.</p><p>But mostly this is just &mldr; fine? People have different tastes. My hyperactive brain writes for others with hyperactive brains. If you prefer a different writing style, find an author that matches that!</p></div><p>Speaking of promises &mldr;</p><h3 id=genre>Genre</h3><p>The biggest promise is the Genre.</p><p>You should <em>know</em> the genre of your book. (Or, potentially, the two or three genres it tries to mix and combine.)</p><p>Moreover, you should communicate that <em>everywhere</em>. (This will become even clearer as you get further into the course.)</p><ul><li>In your first chapter, reinforce the genre</li><li>On your cover, reinforce the genre</li><li>Through your biggest plot points or characters, reinforce the genre</li><li>Label your book correctly, in your query letter or when you self-publish</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s no use lying. I&rsquo;ve seen writers put genre labels on their books that are currently &ldquo;hip&rdquo; or they think will sell well. The only result is negative reviews from people saying the book &ldquo;was not as advertised&rdquo; or &ldquo;not what they expected&rdquo;.</p><p>The book might still be good! That&rsquo;s the point here. The quality of the book doesn&rsquo;t matter &mldr; if you don&rsquo;t promise the right thing and thus reach the wrong audience.</p><p>Again, there&rsquo;s a balance here. Partially, you want your book to <em>copy</em> what other books in the genre do. That&rsquo;s what sold your book, so that&rsquo;s what you promised the reader. On the other hand, you want your book to be different, unique and creative. Also <em>change</em> some genre trappings on purpose.</p><p>To summarize this,</p><blockquote><p>Copy the things that work in your genre (and each successful book uses), change the things that will make <em>your</em> book unique.</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>One of my oldest books tried to <em>mix</em> fantasy and science-fiction. (It was originally for a writing competition from a publisher who did both.) I thought this was a great idea. The issue? It wasn&rsquo;t an actual mix and it wasn&rsquo;t communicated enough.</p><p>The first half of the book is decidedly fantasy, while the latter half decidedly science-fiction. That&rsquo;s not a mix; that&rsquo;s just two books smashed into one. People who read the first chapter and liked it &mldr; were disappointed when the story slowly shifted to a different genre. Conversely, people who would&rsquo;ve loved the second part, never got through the first part.</p><p>Also, the cover showed a fantasy island with fantasy lettering, which also hid the science-fiction roots.</p></div><p>Speaking about being unique &mldr;</p><h2 id=unique-selling-point>Unique Selling Point</h2><p>Some people like to call this the <strong>hook</strong>. It&rsquo;s the one thing that makes your book <em>unique</em>. The one thing that makes it stand out among the crowd.</p><p>When people compare your book to others with the same target audience, yours should have something <em>unique</em>. More importantly, it should <em>communicate</em> that unique thing as clearly as possible. (No use adding a unique selling point if you&rsquo;re not actually using it during the selling part!)</p><p>There is no formula here, of course. A USP is just a golden nugget you find somewhere. It&rsquo;s the original creative idea that probably started the book or made it interesting to you. It&rsquo;s the thing that hits you as you cycle to work (&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome if &mldr;&rdquo;). Or the thing that frustrates you as you watch a movie (&ldquo;why can there never be a vampire movie that does X right?&rdquo;)</p><p>But the key is that the USP should be something instantly <strong>interesting</strong> and <strong>extraordinary</strong>.</p><p>It can be interesting in a cerebral way (like posing a problem that the reader wants answered).</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Many fantasy books include some unique <em>rule</em> about their world in the description. A rule that&rsquo;s clearly phrased in a way to make you think &ldquo;huh, I wonder how X and Y works in that world&rdquo;.</p></div><p>It can be interesting in a fun way (appealing to a common fantasy or dream your target audience might have).</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Many kids dream of going to a magic school, like Harry Potter. That&rsquo;s just an instant fantasy and an instant draw. If you&rsquo;re writing a book in that genre, you want to put that front and center, <em>and</em> really use it in the story. Silence everybody who claims you just ripped off Harry Potter by changing <em>enough</em> about the hook to make it unique.</p></div><p>If you&rsquo;re stuck and do want some &ldquo;formula&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s better to go through the &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; angle.</p><ul><li>Find something that&rsquo;s ordinary in our daily life. Something common, something most people understand, something that always works like X. This might also be a general goal or agreed-upon thing in the world.</li><li>Now add a big <strong>but</strong> to that sentence and find a way to flip it on its head.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><ul><li>In my novel, people still go to school, <strong>but</strong> they must go there until they&rsquo;re 40.</li><li>Society has found a way to get rid of fossil fuels, <strong>but</strong> it requires sacrificing animals.</li><li>Due to technology, people have stopped evolving (in the biological sense). <strong>But</strong> now one person is born with mutated genes that are clearly superior.</li></ul></div><p>Hopefully you start to see why I want you thinking about marketing <em>before</em> you even write the book. It helps write the actual book. It streamlines the story and its main idea, while you already have the one-liner to sell it.</p><p>Additionally, conforming a story to such a simple hook <em>after the fact</em> is nigh impossible. You&rsquo;ll most likely add all sorts of subplots, extra characters, and other themes that muddle up the marketing.</p><p>And if you don&rsquo;t have a hook? If you have no unique selling point? Well &mldr; why would a reader ever pick <em>your</em> book over any other?</p><p>In the next chapter, I&rsquo;ll talk about marketing blurbs and &ldquo;loglines&rdquo; (one sentence to pitch your book).</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/the-two-hats/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>The Two Hats</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/how-to-sell-your-work-ii/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>How to Sell your Work II</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
