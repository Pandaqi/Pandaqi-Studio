This chapter is more about the specific content of your book and the marketing text you&rsquo;ll add.</p><p>I like to go in several stages:</p><ul><li>First a one-liner that summarizes the book (the &ldquo;logline&rdquo;)</li><li>Then several lines</li><li>Then a paragraph</li><li>Then a few paragraphs</li><li>Until you finally have a 1 or 2 page summary of the full book (the &ldquo;synopsis&rdquo;)</li></ul><p>You can do it in this order (if you already have a great one-liner hook from which to start). Or you can do it in reverse (if you already have a general plot and want to whittle it down)</p><p>Of course, the synopsis isn&rsquo;t going to be part of the marketing. You&rsquo;ll typically send it towards publishers or literary agents when you send your manuscript. More on that later.</p><p>If you do this, you&rsquo;ll be forced to figure out what your story is actually about. You must separate the spice on top from the actual dish. You must decide which storyline or idea is the most important, and which are only worth a mention when you have enough space.</p><p>Typically,</p><ul><li>The one-liner is used for pitching, internally with publishers, or as a shorthand for selling your book.</li><li>The paragraph is your (online) marketing text next to the book cover.</li><li>Multiple paragraphs are the blurb on the book cover (or a longer pitch).</li></ul><p>To be honest, most people cheat with the one-liner. It&rsquo;s actually two or three lines smashed into one. There&rsquo;s no clear threshold here, it&rsquo;s more about the general idea: selling why somebody should read your book in as few words as possible.</p><h2 id=mistake-marketing-doesnt-work-like-you-think>Mistake: marketing doesn&rsquo;t work like you think</h2><p>What do most people do when you ask them to market something? They add things they <em>think</em> marketing should be. They add hollow words like &ldquo;an exceptional novel&rdquo; and &ldquo;rated highly&rdquo; and &ldquo;the best read of this year&rdquo;.</p><p>People have this ingrained idea that marketing is all lies and the same buzzwords repeated over and over.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not. Because people &ldquo;know&rdquo; this, they see right through that bullshit.</p><p>It also doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. In the previous chapter, I established that no book is for &ldquo;everyone&rdquo;. That a clear target audience is needed. So &mldr; if you say a book is &ldquo;the best thing you&rsquo;ll ever read&rdquo;, what does it mean? Nothing! Because you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re the actual target audience! For you, it might be the <em>worst</em> thing you&rsquo;ll ever read.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t add hollow words or phrases. Don&rsquo;t try to embellish your book here and there.</p><p>Your job is to pitch <em>the actual book</em> and include <em>potential reasons why somebody might want to read it</em>.</p><h2 id=mistake-obvious-statements>Mistake: obvious statements</h2><p>You&rsquo;re writing about the most important parts of a novel. There is no need to add statements like &ldquo;in this novel &mldr;&rdquo; or &ldquo;of course, there are also other characters &mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>People know that this one paragraph isn&rsquo;t a summary of the whole book. Of course they do!</p><ul><li>If you only have one paragraph, stick to the <em>main protagonist</em> and the <em>main storyline</em> of the book.</li><li>Leave out anything that is obvious or irrelevant, and don&rsquo;t repeat yourself.</li><li>Phrase sentences as simple present, with no uncertainty (&ldquo;you will read about &mldr;&rdquo; or &ldquo;the hero might just be in danger &mldr;&rdquo;)</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>BAD: &ldquo;<em>Dancing Dodos</em> is a novel filled with colorful characters. As you follow Hank around the country, searching for the last Dodo egg, you will also encounter a great evil that might wipe out the famous Dodo for good!&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>BETTER: &ldquo;Hank has one mission: find and protect the last Dodo egg. Ghosts chase him across the country, knowing that, if used incorrectly, that one egg would destroy the world.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Also notice how the second version is more <em>specific</em>. It actually gives details instead of general, clich√© statements about danger or great evil. It also provides a potential hook: why would one egg destroy the world? Is Hank the bad guy here, or the ghosts?</p><h2 id=writing-the-logline>Writing the Logline</h2><p>I like the approach given in the <em>Save the Cat (writes a novel)</em> book. It structures the logline in a way that matches what I&rsquo;ve come to learn about good story structure. It does so using a few &ldquo;beats&rdquo; of its &ldquo;15-beat structure&rdquo;. (For more details, check my article about it in the Storytelling course: <a href=../../storytelling/beat-sheet/>Beat Sheet</a>.)</p><p>For our purposes, I&rsquo;ll just explain the beats you need to know.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Break&rdquo;: the moment our protagonist is forced to leave their old (comfortable) world and embark on the adventure into a new (and unknown) world</li><li>&ldquo;Midpoint&rdquo;: the moment halfway the story that suddenly raises the stakes and changes the trajectory. (This moment prevents the &ldquo;muddy middle&rdquo; problem, where books are aimless and slow around their middle part.)</li><li>&ldquo;Theme Stated&rdquo;: a moment near the start of the story where the theme (the lesson the protagonist hopefully learns) is stated or shown.</li><li>&ldquo;All is Lost&rdquo;: the darkest point of the story, where all seems lost and the hero defeated. (Usually people act out of <em>fear</em> of reaching the bottom of this pit.)</li></ul><p>Now the logline becomes a simple formula.</p><blockquote><p><em>On the verge of a <strong>stasis = death</strong> moment, a flawed hero <strong>Breaks</strong>; but when the <strong>Midpoint</strong> happens, they must learn the <strong>Theme Stated</strong> before <strong>All Is Lost</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>What does &ldquo;stasis = death&rdquo; mean? It means that doing <em>nothing</em> is no option. Standing still&mdash;stasis&mdash;would mean the hero loses, dies, or falls even further.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a <em>crucial</em> thing that many stories forget. They introduce an interesting world and conflict &mldr; but no reason for the protagonist to actually <em>act</em> and do it <em>now</em>. They forget urgency and risk. Hence, a good story should start with the realization that if the main character does nothing &mldr; their life will end.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see some examples from my own work. Obviously, mild spoilers! (I advice you to figure out the loglines to your own stories and to books/films you&rsquo;re consuming, as a practice.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>WILDEBYTE (book 1): On the verge of failing and being uninstalled, a reckless person inside a device must complete a mission to get secret data out of its memory; but when they realize their mission isn&rsquo;t as it seems, they must learn to regain control of their own body before they are erased forever.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>WILDEBYTE (book 5): On the verge of giving up due to loneliness, Wildebyte hatches a plan to force another character to travel with them through other video games; but when they realize the true origin of their game, they must choose between loneliness and a friend with terrible influence, before they unleash a virus that kills the whole device.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>SAGA OF LIFE (&ldquo;The Planeats&rdquo;): On the verge of running out of fuel before they get home, Arren gives his robot full control over navigating their spaceship; but when the robot reveals to have steered them in the wrong direction on purpose, Arren must learn to what extent AI can be trusted, before they run headfirst into planet-eating monsters.</p></div><p>Of course, this is a strict template. For your book, you want to rephrase this in a more natural and fitting way. You might also add or remove parts. Especially if part of the logline becomes part of the actual marketing, you want to break away from this template!</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t actually use this logline template before writing the stories above. (I only learned about this specific one <em>later</em>.) The three stories I picked are very different from each other, but the template still fits like a glove. That&rsquo;s why I recommend it.</p><p>Also, writing these examples showed me how my older work does <em>not</em> fit as well. (Wildebyte Arcades and Saga of Life are both quite recent works of mine.) I tried to give an older example, but they usually didn&rsquo;t have one of the beats. For educational purposes, I&rsquo;ll still give one of those &ldquo;failed&rdquo; loglines.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>MY FIRST NOVEL (never published): On the verge of a (terrorist) attack on his school, Karan starts an investigation among his own classmates; but when (there&rsquo;s no clear Midpoint!), they learn how easy it is to manipulate truth or act on lies, and must now prevent an attack they started themselves (the &ldquo;All is Lost&rdquo; is basically the same as the &ldquo;Stasis = Death&rdquo;!)</p></div><p>I have plans to <em>rewrite</em> that first novel one day, because there are certainly good elements there. But the logline reveals missing parts, such as a clear structure and midpoint, and a clear <em>personal</em> risk for Karan if he doesn&rsquo;t act.</p><p>As you see, the logline is really two (or three) sentences. But it&rsquo;s just short and efficient enough to count it as a one-liner, if you want.</p><h2 id=marketing-blurb>Marketing Blurb</h2><p>The logline is great for pitching. Both in a business sense and when simply explaining your latest project to friends and family. (Nothing as shameful as the question &ldquo;so what&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; being answered with &ldquo;erm, well, there&rsquo;s this guy, and there are dragons, and I can&rsquo;t really explain it&rdquo;.)</p><p>But you won&rsquo;t put this on the back of your book, or in the description at the online book store.</p><p>That&rsquo;s usually one or two paragraphs, which answer a few more questions. Common options are &mldr;</p><ul><li>Add information about supporting characters</li><li>Add information about the most important subplot</li><li>Add information about the world and unique setting (if applicable, especially speculative fiction)</li><li>Add information about a recurring mystery or problem (nothing as strong as people&rsquo;s need for <em>answers</em>)</li><li>Add information and praise about your previous work (if you have actual impressive credits)</li></ul><h3 id=short--sweet>Short & Sweet</h3><p>I am of the opinion that these should be short and sweet. If I pick up a book in the store and the blurb at the back is four dense paragraphs of text &mldr; you&rsquo;ve lost me already.</p><p>It shows, to me, that you do <em>not</em> know how to write efficiently and that you do <em>not</em> know what your story is actually about.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a great <strong>test</strong>.</p><ul><li>Improvise a book cover template. (Grab an A4 paper and fold it in half to get front/back. Or install some graphics software and open a document.)</li><li>Now, in a <em>readable</em> font at a <em>readable</em> size, write your blurb on the back.</li><li>See how much you can fit before it becomes a wall of text or consumes the full back. I like to keep plenty of margin on the sides and to make sure the blurb only covers the top half.</li></ul><p>This shows you what is too much (or too little).</p><h3 id=simple-sentences>Simple Sentences</h3><p>The logline above is a bit dangerous, because it might convince you that blurbs should be <em>really long sentences</em> which explain everything. They shouldn&rsquo;t. If your description starts with a long sentence that has five parts, you&rsquo;ve also lost me.</p><p>Try to start with a short sentence. Keep longer sentences for later, once you already have somebody&rsquo;s attention. (People only read the last half of your blurb if they are intrigued by the first.)</p><p>Remember the &ldquo;credits&rdquo; system! At first, a potential reader does not have enough credits to read a <em>long</em> sentence or jump straight into reading that first preview chapter. They barely have enough credits to read one or two short sentences of marketing blurb&mdash;so make those count. Make those <em>earn</em> credits for a longer read.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Those are all my general tips for how to view your book as a <em>product</em> to <em>market</em> and <em>publish</em>.</p><ul><li>Know your target audience and conform the book to their wishes</li><li>Know your unique selling point and put it front and center</li><li>Be able to summarize your book at many different lengths (one sentence, three sentences, paragraph, &mldr;)</li><li>And use that to pitch the book or get your marketing blurb</li><li>Use the &ldquo;credits system&rdquo; as a way to remember this. Readers give you only one credit at the start, so make sure the first pieces they see increase the number of credits you get.</li></ul><p>Keep all these things in mind from the <em>start</em>. It gives you a great handhold when writing the actual book, as you already know the killer one-liner you&rsquo;ll use to sell it. (Which also motivates you to not mess it up and deviate from it too much.)</p><p>You can refine as you go and finalize these texts when the book is actually <em>done</em>. But completely inventing the target audience and unique selling point <em>after</em> writing the book &mldr; isn&rsquo;t a great idea.</p><p>Next chapters will dive into how traditional publishing works, including tips for the specifics such as a query letter.</p><p>The chapter on self-publishing (and related skills) come after that.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/how-to-sell-your-work-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>How to Sell your Work I</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/traditional-publishing/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Traditional Publishing</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
