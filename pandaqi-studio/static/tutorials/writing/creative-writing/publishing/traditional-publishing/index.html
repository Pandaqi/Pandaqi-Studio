This usually includes an <em>advance</em>, which is like the price they pay for getting the <em>rights</em> to publish your book.</li><li>They will ask you to make changes, while also having their own editors take a look.</li><li>They will deal with everything else (cover, marketing, distribution, pre-orders, etcetera.)</li><li>Until, perhaps a year later, the book is officially published.</li></ol><p>Of course, most people are <em>rejected</em>. It&rsquo;s the cold, hard truth. Be ready for dozens of rejection letters. As many writers say: use them as fuel to grow and keep going. Use them as evidence of how much you already achieved. It is <em>very, very rare</em> that somebody is published traditionally without ever receiving a rejection (or twenty).</p><p>At first, the rejections will be boilerplate. The same standard email sent to everyone.</p><p>But as you improve, the rejections might become personal. They might include some more specific feedback or reasons for rejecting. That&rsquo;s how you know you&rsquo;re on the right path.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My first rejection was simply &ldquo;sorry, your manuscript doesn&rsquo;t fit our publishing house&rdquo; (but with a bit more fancy words). Later on, I received comments like &ldquo;we feel the book has too much dialogue&rdquo; or &ldquo;some odd phrasings in the first chapter threw us off, such as X and Y&rdquo;</p></div><p>Keep going, keep being rejected, until the rejection turns into a book deal.</p><h3 id=watch-out-for-vanity-press>Watch out for vanity press</h3><p>What&rsquo;s the role of the publisher? It&rsquo;s to take all non-writing duties <em>out of your hands</em>. It&rsquo;s to take that Business Hat off of your head.</p><p>Any publisher who does <em>not</em> do this, isn&rsquo;t an actual publisher and shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted. At best, they&rsquo;re incompetent. At worst, they&rsquo;re a downright scam that borders on fraud and theft.</p><p>What do I mean with that?</p><ul><li>You should never <em>pay</em> to be published. The publisher shoulders the full monetary risk.</li><li>You should never be <em>forced</em> to buy X copies yourself, or do your own marketing. The publisher might ask you to post on your blog or talk about the book, but they shoulder the actual heavy duties for marketing.</li><li>You should build a relationship of trust and collaboration with your publisher. You focus on your books&mdash;they focus on editing and distributing. If you have to do all the business things yourself, if you have to <em>pay</em>, then you&rsquo;re in the wrong place.</li></ul><p>Such publishers are usually called &ldquo;vanity press&rdquo;. Though they will surely invent all sorts of excuses for why they are different or better than that.</p><h3 id=yes-you-lose-some-ownership>Yes, you lose some ownership</h3><p>Most contracts will sideline you during the business stuff. You might be allowed to &ldquo;advise&rdquo; on the cover, but they will have the final say. You might be allowed to proofread the marketing blurb, but they will write it and have final say.</p><p>Of course, they don&rsquo;t want to annoy you! They want a cover that the author likes. They want the book to be presented in a way the author can live with. There should be a discussion and open communication.</p><p>Just know that you <em>are</em> giving away a lot of control and ownership. This is the major draw of publishers. Most authors don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to create their own cover. They don&rsquo;t even want to have to think about it.</p><p>Others, like me, take issue with that. I like doing things myself and I like challenging myself with projects in different creative areas.</p><p>In the end, it&rsquo;s up to you whether you sign that contract.</p><h3 id=right-to-publish>Right to Publish</h3><p>Finally, publishers should merely receive the <em>right to publish</em>. The work is still yours. You are the author and you have ownership. If you change your mind, you can retract the contract and the right to publish your work. (Which obviously has consequences and means you lose the money, but that depends on the specific contract.)</p><p>This also means that there are sometimes different publishers for different <em>versions</em> of your work. (For example, one handles the paperback, another the ebook.) It&rsquo;s not necessarily recommended, but it <em>can</em> happen. The publishing rights can also expire.</p><p>They should <em>not</em> receive full rights of ownership. The work remains yours, for now and always.</p><h3 id=advance>Advance</h3><p>The &ldquo;advance&rdquo; is simply a sum of money paid <em>in advance</em> as income for the writer and a sign of trust. Because, as a writer, you only start earning once the book is <em>published</em> and brings in royalties. (And many books never sell enough for a proper income, but that&rsquo;s another story.)</p><p>The more famous you are, the less risky, and thus the <em>bigger</em> this advance.</p><p>This is another sign of a proper traditional publisher. They might pay you 10,000 dollars in advance for the right to publish your book. Because they believe in it, they believe in <em>you</em>, and they believe they&rsquo;ll get a return on investment.</p><p>Notice, though, that this is an <em>advance</em>. It&rsquo;s not free money. The first 10,000 dollars you book earns in royalties go to the publisher. To &ldquo;pay back&rdquo; the advance.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve exceeded that threshold, royalties are split between you and the publisher again.</p><p>Still, this is a very good system for the <em>writer</em>. You&rsquo;ll have a certain income, even before the book is published, even if the book doesn&rsquo;t sell well. If a publisher is willing to pay you a (considerable) advance, you know you&rsquo;re in a good place.</p><h3 id=edits>Edits</h3><p>In general, edits remain your territory. You are still the writer. You have your writing style and your vision for the book, so <em>you</em> are the best person to perform the edits.</p><p>Publishers will have editors look at your work and <em>suggest</em> edits. But they shouldn&rsquo;t actually go through with them and change your book <em>without your consent</em>.</p><p>Usually, you get a long list of notes and proposed changes, and a deadline for the next version. If I&rsquo;m honest, this is not so bad. Because the changes are proposed by others&mdash;expert editors, even&mdash;you can trust them to be valuable and worth your time. Even if you decide you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to implement a certain change, this is a learning process that will improve your next book.</p><p>The deadlines will be tight, but nothing a professional writer can&rsquo;t handle.</p><h2 id=pros--cons>Pros & Cons</h2><p>Below are the biggest advantages and disadvantages of traditional publishing. Of course, I am comparing it with the only alternative: Self-Publishing.</p><h3 id=pros>Pros</h3><ul><li>You are paid an advance.</li><li>The risk is on the publisher, not you.</li><li>They take care of most business aspects for you. This usually means better marketing and more books sold. It also means a <em>lower price</em> per book (as they can print large offsets).</li><li>The publisher helps to edit and polish the book. (A second set of professional eyes is invaluable on any creative project.)</li><li>Being traditionally published is like a seal of excellence. Others will assume you&rsquo;re a competent writer worth their time.</li><li>You&rsquo;ll meet powerful people within the publishing industry. Such connections will serve you well for a lifetime.</li></ul><p>Yes, <strong>networking</strong> is still the magic word in the business world. (Unfortunately.) The more people you can meet, the more relationships you can foster with other writers and readers, the better you will fare. This is true, for everyone, for all situations. And getting published (by a major, traditional publisher) will automatically get you in touch with some of the biggest people in the business.</p><h3 id=cons>Cons</h3><ul><li>Hard and time-consuming to be successful. It might take 6 months before they reach out. You need to put in a lot of work beforehand with a slim chance of getting a favorable response. (And even then, you might be rejected simply because you sent it at an infortune time.)</li><li>You lose a lot of control.</li><li>You might be required to do extra edits or put in some more work.</li><li>You earn less per book, as the publisher takes a slice.</li></ul><h2 id=literary-agents>Literary Agents</h2><p>Where do <em>literary agents</em> fit in all of this?</p><p>It used to be quite easy to send a manuscript to publishers directly. But since then, the size of the book industry&mdash;and the number of writers&mdash;has exploded. Overwhelmed by the ridiculous amount of manuscripts sent their way (the &ldquo;slush pile&rdquo;), most publishers have removed this possibility entirely.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Most of them, at least in the Netherlands, also cited that during all those years only <strong>two</strong> books from that pile of manuscripts were actually accepted and published.</p></div><p>Nowadays, literary agents are the middle man.</p><ul><li>You send your manuscript to literary agents first.</li><li>If they accept you (which is a bit more likely), <em>they</em> will go to publishers to pitch your book</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s a good system and one of which you should probably take advantage. It offloads even <em>more</em> of the business side to others, at the cost of losing even more control and royalties.</p><p>A good agent takes ~10% of each book sale. Yes, you also <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> need to pay them in advance. The risk is still on their shoulders, as they only get paid if you get paid. As such, they only accept manuscripts they truly believe they can sell.</p><p>They also usually negotiate contracts about film rights, translations, different versions, etcetera.</p><p>If you ask me, I&rsquo;d go through a Literary Agent, always.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean guaranteed success, though. Famously, J.K. Rowling already found her literary agent at the first try, but they had to visit thirteen publishers before they convinced one of them.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction, and a pretty big one.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-send-my-manuscript>How do I send my manuscript?</h2><p>Different agents/publishers might have slightly different requirements. You&rsquo;ll have to read about that on their website. (They might require a certain file format, or font, or layout.)</p><p>But below is the golden standard for every book.</p><ul><li>A query letter. (The pitch, metadata, about the author.)</li><li>A synopsis. (Full plot in a single page.)</li><li>The first 50 pages of your book.</li></ul><p>Don&rsquo;t send your whole book. It&rsquo;s probably fine, but it&rsquo;s unnecessary and risky. Given the number of manuscripts they have to read, there&rsquo;s no sense sending your whole book.</p><p>Remember the &ldquo;credits system&rdquo; I explained before! You only get a few credits from the agent/publisher. If they don&rsquo;t like your pitch, they&rsquo;re not even reading your manuscript. If they don&rsquo;t like your first page, they don&rsquo;t give you enough credits for the second page.</p><p>The first 50 pages is enough for anybody to judge whether they want your book or not. They <em>might</em> ask the full manuscript in a response (without accepting you yet). Again, it&rsquo;s probably fine, but make sure you trust the other side of this conversation before doing so.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why the synopsis is so important. They use it to see if your story keeps the quality of the first fifty pages. To check if the plot has a satisfying ending, without actually reading the full book. (Another reason why a synopsis should be <em>complete</em> and full of <em>spoilers</em>.)</p><h3 id=what-if-the-manuscript-isnt-finished-yet>What if the manuscript isn&rsquo;t finished yet?</h3><p>In that case, you can send a &ldquo;book proposal&rdquo;. A detailed plan for the book you <em>will</em> write, if the publisher agrees to give you the money to do so (and obviously publish the book in the end).</p><p>This is obviously even more risky for the publisher, so it will be a tough sell. This is mostly done by names that are already famous or popular. Those might be writers, but might also be celebrities or people famous in their own fields (who want to write a non-fiction book about their knowledge).</p><p>Of course, I should mention that celebrities don&rsquo;t actually write that book themselves. They pay a ghostwriter to do it, then plaster their name on the front for <em>marketing</em> purposes. Yeah, remember what I told you about putting on your &ldquo;Business Hat&rdquo; in this course? ;)</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Initially, I wanted to include specific publishing houses, and reviews about how they work or how their submission process works. But this, obviously, differs depending on your country or language. I also <em>certainly</em> don&rsquo;t have experience with all the big ones. A lot of my experience I do have, is from years ago when I just started writing.</p><p>So I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to figure out that part on your own. Find the major publishers near you, visit their website, check their section about sending in manuscripts, and follow that. It&rsquo;s usually a similar set of requirements.</p><p>Always remember: publishers are there to <em>help you</em> with the <em>business side</em>. It should be a collaboration, you should be colleagues. They shoulder the risk, you provide the goods. If you have to pay, if you have to do everything yourself, if they make unreasonable demands or try to take over the <em>writing side</em> &mldr; walk away.</p><p>Next chapters will talk about how to craft that Query Letter and Synopsis. The two things that must sell your book, before anybody even reads the actual book.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/how-to-sell-your-work-ii/ class="masked big-mask mask-1"><span class=container>How to Sell your Work II</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/publishing/query-letters/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Query Letters</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
