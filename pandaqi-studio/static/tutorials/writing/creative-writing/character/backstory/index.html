I&rsquo;m an improviser, which means I invent backstory &ldquo;as I go&rdquo;. I could not remember or write down any tips or techniques for doing so. After improvising backstories for so long, it just happens automatically, and things seem to come together in my stories. (Usually.)</p><p>That being said, it <em>is</em> an important aspect of writing character. Backstory is basically the explanation for <em>why</em> they&rsquo;re the way they are. It&rsquo;s another story, unwritten, that comes before the current one. This course taught you that empathy is crucial, and empathy comes from understanding, which naturally means that <em>backstory</em> is crucial.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I actually did not do this in my earliest stories. Characters were just &mldr; the way they are. There was never information about their past, because they did not <em>have</em> an interesting past. This was surely a mistake. It made characters all feel like the same cardboard cutouts. It felt like they were &ldquo;born&rdquo; at the start of the story, and only to serve the story, because there was no history.</p></div><h2 id=the-key>The key</h2><p>But I guess I already gave you the answer.</p><blockquote><p>Backstory should create empathy. It does so by explaining what events lead to a character&rsquo;s current state.</p></blockquote><p>A secondary purpose of backstory is to reveal information or mystery. But this should be handled with care, because if a character actually knows crucial information or secrets, then audiences are quick to ask the (annoyed) question: &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t they just TELL that!?&rdquo;</p><p>No, the first and foremost purpose is the mystery of &ldquo;why is our hero so distrusting?&rdquo; or &ldquo;how did the hero lose their leg?&rdquo; or &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t the hero speaking to his mother anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>So, as a simple step-by-step guide to backstory, you&rsquo;d have.</p><ul><li>Invent a great character for your current story.</li><li>Look at their biggest strengths and weaknesses, their most memorable details.</li><li>For each of them, figure out a reason for <em>why</em> they exist.</li><li>Connect these reasons into a coherent backstory for the character.</li><li>Reveal this backstory in bits and pieces, at relevant moments (not all at once)</li></ul><p>You <em>can</em> do it the other way around: you invent a great backstory, then base your character on that. The pitfall here is, of course, that your resulting character is not a great fit for the actual story you&rsquo;re telling. And the <em>actual</em> story is always more important than the <em>backstory</em>.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This works best if your great backstory is just a <em>prequel</em> to the story. If the backstory is so interesting, turn it into a full story! (And once that story is done, you know the state of your character at that point, and can write subsequent plots around it.)</p></div><h2 id=how-to-reveal-backstory>How to reveal backstory?</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s backstory or unknown history. People don&rsquo;t like to talk about it and it usually doesn&rsquo;t come up in conversation (in a natural way).</p><p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been struggling with a chronic illness for 10+ years. Almost everyone around me <em>doesn&rsquo;t even know this</em>. Because when would I talk about it? When would I say &ldquo;hey, out of the blue, just so you know, here&rsquo;s my history with disease&rdquo;? Never. The only people who truly know are those who have <em>seen</em> or <em>experienced</em> the limitations this places upon me.</p><p>The same is true for story. Don&rsquo;t forcefully insert backstory all the time. Don&rsquo;t literally state it at weird moments. Instead, I think the rule below is a good general principle.</p><blockquote><p>True character is revealed in the choices somebody makes under pressure.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, <em>conflict</em> is the state in which people reveal hidden or deeper parts about themselves.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t mention my chronic disease out of the blue. But throw me in a situation where my illness <em>prevents</em> me from doing something (or makes it really hard to do), and now I suddenly have a conflict. I have to show or explain this information to someone in hopes of resolving the situation.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s generally recommended to throw your characters into conflicts all the time&mdash;the bigger the better. That&rsquo;s the natural state in which they reveal personality, flaws, backstory, everything. Either by <em>showing</em> it (in how they deal with the conflict) or through dialogue (because they need somebody else, or other people are asking sensible questions).</p><h2 id=an-example>An example</h2><p>This is an example of the &ldquo;backstory as I go&rdquo;-approach. I like to do this because, as stated, the actual story is more important then backstory. I focus on the main plot first, trying to come up with interesting scene after interesting scene, and let that <em>determine</em> my backstory. Otherwise, you run the risk of planning some great background for a character, but having no exciting or suitable way to communicate it in the main story.</p><p>In my book series <em>Wildebyte Arcades</em>, our hero is placed into the world of video games to achieve a mission. They forgot their life <em>before</em> they were put in here.</p><p>As such, a large part of those stories concerns the Wildebyte trying to rediscover their own backstory! But &mldr; I didn&rsquo;t actually know that backstory!</p><p>I wrote the stories whatever way seemed interesting to me. Whenever I had a quiet moment, I invented some new information about Wildebyte&rsquo;s &ldquo;real life&rdquo; on the spot. New information that sounded interesting or cool.</p><p>Over time, this gives me a long <em>list</em> of everything I&rsquo;ve made up. A list of backstory parts (which are already neatly integrated into the plot of each story!) that I simply have to connect.</p><p>I was somewhat &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; that I had to restart the first book several times. This allowed me to write <em>multiple</em> scenes that revealed new backstory ideas, so my list is actually a lot longer than what you learn in the first book.</p><p>Most importantly? After doing this, while standing underneath the shower, my head connected all the dots. It had figured out a way to connect all this backstory into one or two <em>simple</em> explanations that work. That same realization allowed me to figure out the climax to the book: a book that deals with &ldquo;discovering your own past&rdquo; so much, obviously had to end with a big reveal about that.</p><h3 id=why-restart-the-first-book-several-times>Why restart the first book several times?</h3><p>I think the answer to this is very educational for beginning writers, that&rsquo;s why I mention it.</p><p>At my first try, I included <em>multiple</em> video games in one book. I thought this was very exciting! And diverse! The Wildebyte hops between games, so let&rsquo;s showcase that immediately.</p><p>But this didn&rsquo;t work. It made the stories messy and complicated. I vowed to do exactly <em>one</em> video game per story, never more, never less. This helped <em>focus</em> the stories and streamline the plot.</p><p>Then I wrote the second version, but it still didn&rsquo;t work. Wildebyte was already &ldquo;fully formed&rdquo; from chapter 1! They could already hop between games and understood their (technical) world. So what was there to learn? What mysteries were there to reveal? What was left to tell? The stories were <em>already</em> backstory-heavy &mldr; and I just made them about telling <em>backstory</em> even more!</p><p>The lesson here? Do not start your story too early, but also do not start it <em>too late</em>. Instead of revealing interesting backstory later on, actually make that happen at the start of the story.</p><p>I wrote another version, which literally starts (very first line) with the Wildebyte being dropped into the computer world for the very first time. That worked much better.</p><p>But I wasn&rsquo;t done. They were dropped immediately into their &ldquo;fake game&rdquo; (for the mission). They had almost no issue navigating and could start the mission immediately. Wildebyte lacked those <em>restrictions</em> that make characters interesting.</p><p>So yes, another version. The drop went wrong: they were placed at the wrong location. The computer sees Wildebyte as a virus to remove. All the limitations of video games or software <em>also</em> apply to Wildebyte.</p><p>As they say: all writing is rewriting. And your first chapters are <em>so</em> crucial to making sure your story isn&rsquo;t broken, that I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile to try a few different approaches until you find the best one.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/character/fixing-a-broken-story/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Fixing a Broken Story</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/character/conclusion/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Conclusion</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
