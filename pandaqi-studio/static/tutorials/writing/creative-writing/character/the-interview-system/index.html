I give tips to quickly find a strong <em>core</em> for a character, and say that details (such as appearance or personality) flow from that.</p><p>Well, this chapter is for you&mdash;kind of. I know quite a few authors who invent characters through a sort of &ldquo;interview&rdquo; or &ldquo;questionnaire&rdquo; system.</p><p>They have a long list of questions they ask their character. Think of questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s their eye color?&rdquo; or &ldquo;To what school do they go?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s their relationship with their parents?&rdquo;</p><p>By answering all of them, they slowly get all the nitty-gritty details of this fictional character. Once they&rsquo;ve conducted the interview, they&rsquo;re ready to write.</p><p>I wanted to provide you such a list in this chapter, but could not find a set of questions that was both <em>short</em> and <em>might be useful</em>. This whole course explains, time and time again, why the core of a character (empathy + purpose) is important&mdash;not the details. Conducting such an interview ignores that entirely and misses the point, unless you ask <em>so many questions</em> that you find their core personality anyway.</p><p><em>However</em>, asking your character questions is a good tool! You just need to make sure you ask the right questions and answer them in a useful way.</p><h2 id=what-questions-to-ask>What questions to ask?</h2><p>You invent a list of awkward, hard or complicated situations. Then you ask your character how they would respond.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>While standing next to your best friend, you realize or learn that today was their birthday! What do you do?</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>As you shut off the lamps and walk up the stairs to your bedroom &mldr; you hear a burglar come in. What do you do?</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>An important, valuable object is stolen from you. What do you do? Let&rsquo;s say you also know who did it: your mother. What do you do now?</p></div><p>By answering these questions, you get a clear picture of who your character <em>is</em>. And it&rsquo;s a fun technique that invites more creativity. This is how you make the &ldquo;interview system&rdquo; useful, in my view.</p><p>This list of situations depends on your genre, story style, setting, age of the character, etcetera. (You might throw a kid into different situations than an adult.) That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t just give you my list and set you on your way.</p><p>But the idea is simply to invent simple situations with conflict. Something awkward, something uncertain, something that requires action or a response.</p><p>Of course, if you already have an <em>inciting incident</em> or other plot points&mdash;use those as questions!</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>If you really like getting the nitty-gritty details first, obviously just ask questions about that! These tools exist to help you and aid you, not to forbid you from doing something you&rsquo;d really like to do.</p></div><h2 id=how-to-answer-them>How to answer them?</h2><p>If you have trouble coming up with good answers, you can take a more logical approach. (This also helps when you have a scene in the story, but you just don&rsquo;t know how to continue or how the characters will solve it.)</p><p>Suppose X is <em>a</em> possible response to the situation. Create two lists:</p><ul><li>One with arguments for why they would do X (as a response)</li><li>One with arguments for why they would NOT do X (as a response)</li></ul><p>The side with the strongest arguments obviously determines what they choose. Keep going until you find a response that feels fitting.</p><p>This trains you to think logically through all possibilities and find the one most consistent or interesting for your story. It also forces you to think like a character. To see the situation through the eyes of the character, coming up with any reasons why they would or would not make a choice.</p><h3 id=an-example>An example</h3><p>Imagine our character is a guard. They guard some very important prison or prisoner. Now another person approaches, in a black cloak, offering them a <em>lot</em> of golden coins for opening the gate and walking away. That&rsquo;s the inciting incident of our story.</p><p>What do they do? You make the lists.</p><p>Why would they accept the bribe?</p><ul><li>They&rsquo;re poor and really need the money.</li><li>They&rsquo;re secretly sympathetic with the prisoner they&rsquo;re guarding.</li><li>They&rsquo;re insecure or easy to sway.</li></ul><p>Why would they NOT accept the bribe?</p><ul><li>They do not want to lose their job.</li><li>They believe in honor, bravery and responsibility.</li><li>They&rsquo;re afraid for their safety (or that of their family) once their treachery comes out.</li></ul><p>Just by inventing these arguments, we already get a more detailed idea of this guard. We get some conflicting desires inside them, making this inciting incident even more interesting. We can convey these reasons as <em>dialogue</em> or <em>thoughts</em> during the scene.</p><p>Now you pick one thing to <em>focus</em> on. Maybe the fact that they&rsquo;re poor is the most important theme of the book and the aspect most explored. Then this argument weighs more heavily than others, which means &mldr; the guard accepts the bribe.</p><p>Is that not an interesting first chapter? An impactful decision, but completely logical. The reader already has a strong idea of who this interesting guard character is. And all of that just by improvising a list of arguments for and against a decision.</p><h2 id=now-write>Now write!</h2><p>Invent your list of ~10 interesting situations. For each character, answer how they&rsquo;d respond. Preferably, there&rsquo;s no situation to which all characters respond in an identical way!</p><p>When stuck or uncertain, make lists with arguments for and against a certain response. Do so through the eyes of the character, not your own. Pick the side with the best arguments.</p><p>Now write your story with these characters.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/character/the-self-contradiction/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>The Self Contradiction</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/character/the-casting-approach/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>The Casting Approach</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
