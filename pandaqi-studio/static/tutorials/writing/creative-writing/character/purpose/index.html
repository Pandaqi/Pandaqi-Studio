Now let&rsquo;s move to the third component: linking your character to the plot by giving it a specific <em>purpose</em>.</p><p>At first glance, this might seem like it only refers to their <em>skill</em> or <em>actions</em>. But it&rsquo;s much broader than that. As long as you can formulate a specific <em>reason</em> for a character to be in the story, you&rsquo;re probably fine.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;This character adds comic relief&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;This character exists to create conflict with the hero&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;This character exists to give information about the magical world to the hero&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;This character exists to portray more about the setting and the world&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s easiest to call it a <strong>role</strong> the character plays. They should all bring a unique skillset, unique issues, unique way of speaking or taking decisions. Everything else about them (clothing, history, preferences) should be a natural <strong>consequence</strong> of that role.</p><p>You <em>can</em> do it the other way around, of course. Create a character that <em>looks</em> cool, and then invent their personality based on their clothing. In my view, however, this is harder to do and leads to weak connections with the plot. And because character should <em>create</em> plot, you do not want such a weak connection.</p><p>Invent the <em>core</em> of the character first, then let all the details (such as outward appearance) flow from that.</p><p>Notice how I call it a &ldquo;role&rdquo;, like it&rsquo;s a theatre show. You know what never happens in a show? Multiple people playing the same role at the same time.</p><blockquote><p>Invent a unique role for each character. If two characters fill roughly the same role, they&rsquo;re not distinct enough. (Remove one, change one, or combine them into one.)</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You see this most easily in quest or adventure movies. They assemble a team&mdash;and everyone on the team has a unique skillset they bring. One person is the &ldquo;smart one&rdquo;, another is the &ldquo;strong one&rdquo;, another is the &ldquo;wise one&rdquo;, etcetera. If you wrote a heist movie and all the characters could do the same thing, you&rsquo;d miss the other necessary skills, while most characters are standing around doing nothing.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>You can see this in video games too. Whenever they allow you to pick characters or entities, they usually provide a wide range of them. (Archers, cavalry, wizards, spearmen, &mldr;) A common beginner&rsquo;s mistake is to make them all equally powerful. A game should be balanced, right?</p><p>NO! They should all be very good at <em>one thing</em> and terrible at <em>all the others</em>. Each entity has a specific role to fulfill, and it&rsquo;s up to the players to pick the right combinations for each challenge.</p></div><h2 id=recognizable-versus-superficial>Recognizable versus Superficial</h2><p>This is a fine line. We want characters to clearly fill a certain role (and be recognized as such) &mldr; but without making them cliché or stereotypical!</p><p>We want somebody to be &ldquo;the cool hacker of the group&rdquo;, but don&rsquo;t want to stop there. We want to efficiently communicate their role, without resorting to all the clichés about hackers.</p><p>The first rule is that <strong>superficial character is better than no character</strong>. It&rsquo;s better to give somebody one clear personality trait (and nothing more), than giving characters <em>nothing</em>. (Perhaps because you forgot, perhaps in fear of making them a stereotype.)</p><p>I&rsquo;d rather watch a movie with stereotypes, than one with &mldr; blank canvases and grey blobs that have no character at all. (Which, unfortunately, many writers seem fond of nowadays, perhaps to be politically correct. More on that in a minute.)</p><p>The second rule is that <strong>each character should have one stereotype that never changes</strong>. This stereotype? This one-sided character? This cliché set of traits? Make it the <em>core</em> of your character, the thing that never changes, but simply <em>don&rsquo;t stop there</em>.</p><p>If you change everything about your character (through the story) &mldr; they just stop being that character. There must be one thing that stays. Make it the stereotype, as it&rsquo;s an efficient catch-all that allows you to build more nuance <em>on top</em>.</p><h3 id=an-example>An example</h3><p>Take my hacker example. At heart, they&rsquo;re a true hacker. They geek out about new gadgets, they prefer to sit in dark rooms away from the action, they think like a computer. If you stop there, you have a clear distinct character, but also a superficial one. Whenever a choice is presented, the audience already knows 100% what they&rsquo;ll choose.</p><p>So don&rsquo;t stop there. Give them more details, more <strong>specific</strong> ideas that showcase their personality. (Maybe they coded their own gadget and carry it around. You can invent a cool purpose for that gadget and use it in surprising ways. That is a <em>specific, creative</em> implementation of a general stereotype.)</p><p>Give them traits that <strong>conflict</strong> with the stereotype. For example, they very much enjoy nature. So part of them wants to stay inside behind a screen all day, part of them hates this and wants to go outside. Now you have an interesting character. When given the choice to <em>join</em> the action, what will they choose? We don&rsquo;t know! We don&rsquo;t know which side of them feels stronger; which side of them <em>wins</em>!</p><p>But whatever choice they make, it&rsquo;s both surprising &mldr; and consistent with their character.</p><p>In the end, most people fall into similar categories. We stereotype <em>because</em> it helps us out a lot and is often quite accurate. But the devil is in the details. Stereotypes help quickly establish a character&rsquo;s role within the larger story; the interesting part is how they deviate or grow from the stereotype.</p><h2 id=pitfall-recognizable-only-by-name>Pitfall: recognizable only by name</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve read too many books in which I just completely lost track of the characters from page 100 onwards. Usually, there weren&rsquo;t even many characters in the book, nor was the story that complex.</p><p>So why did I completely lose track? What made it very hard to follow? Because the characters were recognizable <strong>only by name</strong>.</p><p>They talked the same. They wanted the same thing. They had no other identifiable properties, at least not ones that were relevant to the plot.</p><p>At that point, names will not help you. I read the name, I have to think for a long time about who it was, and I usually cannot remember (because there <em>is</em> nothing to remember!) After a while, I stop trying, and maybe stop reading entirely.</p><p>Do not do this! Make sure the name of the character is just a shorthand for a wealth of interesting details about them. When writing the characters, regularly reinforce existing traits (or add new ones that match what we already know). If somebody dresses in a memorable style, keep mentioning their clothing or how they interact with it. If somebody has certain beliefs, make sure they shine through in every line of dialogue.</p><p>If you do it well, the audience should be able to recognize a character just by mentioning one detail about them. Just by reading their dialogue, or getting a hint of their clothing, they know exactly who it is.</p><p>And giving your characters a clear (and simple) <em>purpose</em> in the story is the easiest way to do this. Humans remember information through association. So the more you can associate with a character, the better.</p><p>Do not make characters recognizable only by name.</p><h2 id=about-diversity>About diversity</h2><p>Ah, the elephant in the room. The one I&rsquo;ve danced around for a few chapters until I could properly discuss it.</p><p>As mentioned before, simple (unchangeable) <em>facts</em> about a character are by far the <em>least interesting</em> part. Empathy and restrictions form the emotional core of a character. Positive and negative traits, both learned or instinctual, form a compelling character. The color of their skin does not.</p><p>You should fill your stories with the <em>best</em> possible characters. That&rsquo;s your top priority and the only thing that matters. If that means there&rsquo;s an imbalance in any statistic measurable in the real world (such as gender or skin color), so be it. Because you&rsquo;re not trying to write the real world: it&rsquo;s literally called fiction.</p><p>You&rsquo;re not even trying to <em>emulate</em> the real world. Most writing advice is about how stories are a heightened, streamlined and focused version of a reality.</p><p>Most stories take place in a specific, confined setting. If my story happens in China, well guess what, all the characters are going to be Chinese. Even though that&rsquo;s obviously not the only nationality in the world. If my story happens at a boy&rsquo;s school, guess what, most characters are going to be boys!</p><p>It is mindboggling to me why people have started writing stories just to match a certain statistic. And to many, so it seems, as those stories just get a worse and worse reception.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It just never adds up. For example, say it&rsquo;s a historical story that takes place in the Netherlands (my home country). At that time, centuries ago, pretty much nobody would&rsquo;ve had a dark skin color. But they cast 50% of the actors with a dark skin color.</p><p>Now they&rsquo;ve ruined every possible explanation! The appearance doesn&rsquo;t match the historical times. The appearance doesn&rsquo;t match current times (as the vast majority of Dutchmen is still white). But they also don&rsquo;t claim that it&rsquo;s fiction and they can do whatever they want, because they claim to be realistic and representative of the real world.</p><p>For each decision in your story, know your reason, and make sure it&rsquo;s a good one.</p></div><h3 id=what-diversity-really-means>What diversity really means</h3><p>Yes, diversity is important, because diversity <em>enriches</em> a story and allows you to tackle the theme (or emotional core) from many different angles.</p><p>But diversity just means <em>difference</em> or <em>variation</em>.</p><ul><li>If your theme is &ldquo;friendship&rdquo;, you want as many characters as possible with <em>different</em> views and experiences based on friendship.</li><li>If you invent a fantasy world, you probably want characters from all walks of life, characters with <em>different</em> places in this world.</li><li>If your story is heavily themed around nature, you want to fill your setting with many different terrain types and biomes. In such a story, making the whole country the same grassland would be a waste.</li></ul><p>The meaning many people attach to it&mdash;diversity by matching some simple facts to a statistic in the real world&mdash;is worthless and usually a negative influence on the story. Because you&rsquo;ve stopped trying to write the best possible story, to write &mldr; something else instead.</p><p>So here&rsquo;s the simple rule.</p><blockquote><p>When writing a story, simply make the best decisions for the story and nothing else. Adding diversity in ideas is often good, as it makes your story less superficial or predictable. But if there&rsquo;s no clear reason why adding diversity would improve a story, don&rsquo;t add it.</p></blockquote><p>Because each character should serve its own purpose, adding multiple characters automatically adds diversity in ideas and personalities. Trust that and do not force unfounded diversity into the story.</p><h3 id=but-what-if-it-does-matter>But what if it does matter?</h3><p>Yes, in many stories, a character&rsquo;s appearance or gender <em>does matter</em>!</p><p>They lead to different experiences, different challenges, different lives. That&rsquo;s exactly why you can&rsquo;t just change them at will to match a statistic or seem politically correct. It ruins the story or makes it inconsistent at best. If you really want to include such details, make them a <em>core</em> part of the character and the story.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why many stories pick a male and female lead. (Besides writers feeling the almost necessary inclusion of a romance at some point &mldr;) They have a different background or perspective on the world, <em>because</em> of their gender (or sexual orientation), so picking this duo allows the most diverse look into the story.</p><p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t matter? Then &mldr; why are you even thinking about it? Don&rsquo;t mention skin color. Or pick whatever you like at the moment.</p><p>If gender really doesn&rsquo;t matter, then sure, go for it and try to make the characters exactly 50/50 (male and female). That&rsquo;s a <em>choice</em>. But it&rsquo;s equally fine if you make that 20/80, because it is your story and it&rsquo;s up to you to invent the details.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The sneaky solution is of course to invent convoluted reasons as to why these elements always matter in your stories. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you have some dystopian society in which people are forced to lead <em>completely</em> different lives depending on appearance or heritage. Now you have a reason to include everything in equal measures. Use this with caution.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/character/flaws-limitations-and-handicaps/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Flaws, Limitations & Handicaps</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/character/arcs-and-growth/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Arcs & Growth</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
