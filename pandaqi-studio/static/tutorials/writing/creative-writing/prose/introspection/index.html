Especially if you approach writing from the experience of watching films or maybe theater plays. In those, you can&rsquo;t (easily) portray thoughts, only what is said out loud.</p><p>In books, though, it is a very strong tool. Books are told from the perspective of the main characters. The best thing you can do, is make the reader <em>feel</em> like they are the character. To really immerse them in their world and their head. Well, what&rsquo;s better than literally reading their thoughts?</p><h2 id=when-to-write-introspection>When to write introspection</h2><p>You&rsquo;d use introspection for the benefits it has.</p><ul><li>To show contrast: a person does/says something, but thinks something <em>else</em>. (This reveals character better than anything.)</li><li>To communicate information that isn&rsquo;t natural to say out loud, or nobody is around to hear it. (The information itself can be quite bland or objective.)</li><li>To show the thought process before arriving at a conclusion or action. (Remember my chapter on <a href=../beats/>Beats</a>. Big, decisive actions require buildup. Show a character&rsquo;s thoughts as they problem solve, consider options, convince themselves to do it.)</li><li>To ramble about a topic for a longer period without being interrupted. (Not the best benefit, but alright.)</li></ul><p>For me, introspection isn&rsquo;t about getting <em>your</em> thoughts on the paper. It&rsquo;s about getting the <em>character&rsquo;s</em> thoughts on the paper.</p><p>As such, after I&rsquo;ve written a few paragraphs, I ask myself: &ldquo;What would the character think about this? How would they react, internally?&rdquo;</p><p>If I have nothing, or it&rsquo;s not interesting, I continue. If I come up with something valuable, I write it as introspection.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Stories are literally about characters trying to reach a goal but encountering obstacles. This means they constantly need to &ldquo;problem solve&rdquo;. To think about the task at hand and find a way to overcome it. A lot of that can be shown through introspection, as that&rsquo;s the form that fits best.</p><p>In my stories, I usually aim for a balance between &ldquo;problem solving with others&rdquo; (through dialogue, through working together) and &ldquo;problem solving on their own&rdquo; (through introspection and then acting on their decision).</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>One of my short stories (for The Saga of Life) applies the &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; trick. It starts with somebody asking loads of money (from the king) to build a ship and fight pirates. The king is skeptical and asks if that&rsquo;s true.</p><p>They say: &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; But you immediately get their thoughts: <em>It&rsquo;s the truth, alright, just not the whole truth.</em></p><p>It&rsquo;s a natural thought. People convince themselves that their lie isn&rsquo;t actually that bad. But that simple thought also immediately shows character and adds mystery.</p></div><h2 id=how-to-write-introspection>How to write introspection</h2><p>As mentioned at <a href=../the-four-elements/>The Four Elements</a>, different authors use different ways to tell the reader &ldquo;hey, this is a thought&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=inline>Inline</h3><p>I call this &ldquo;inline&rdquo; because I have a programming background. Others might call it a &ldquo;direct POV&rdquo; ( = Point of View) or &ldquo;deep POV&rdquo;.</p><p>The idea is the same. You <em>directly</em> display the thoughts, with no additional markup or tag like &ldquo;he thought&rdquo;.</p><p>To do so, the thought needs to take on the same tense and writing style as the rest of the text.</p><p>The advantage is that it takes fewer words and looks consistent. The disadvantage is that it might be unclear what is a subjective thought and what not, and some thoughts are therefore hard to express this way.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Will he even recognize me anymore?</p><p>I take off my hat to make sure my signature red hair is visible.</p><p>Will he even care? Dang, I&rsquo;m wasting too much time and energy. It&rsquo;s just a simple business meeting. Get yourself together, Sarah.</p></div><p>The thoughts and the action flow into each other without transition or &ldquo;thought tag&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=tagged>Tagged</h3><p>This adds a tag to indicate something is a thought. This allows you to play more with the wording and tense of the thought, as readers realize it&rsquo;s a separate thing from the rest of the prose.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>This is a terrible idea, he thought. The plan was destined to fail, as it hinged on a tiny margin of error and some random chance.</p><p>If even one guard starts his shift a second too late, he thought, we&rsquo;re done for.</p></div><h3 id=untagged>Untagged</h3><p>This allows removing the tag by using a different way to mark thoughts, usually <em>italics</em>. (Some authors might use a different styling, but italics are surely the most popular. And the prettiest, if you ask me.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p><em>I should have grabbed something to eat.</em> Sarah&rsquo;s stomach growled endlessly as she walked into the building. The suitcase in her hand felt heavy, her arms limp, her vision swimming. <em>If I blow this deal because I&rsquo;m too hungry to think, I&rsquo;ll never hear the end of it.</em></p></div><p>When I started out, I used tagged thoughts, then untagged, and now inline. To me, this feels like the strongest method. You never break the flow and you are really <em>inside</em> the head of the character. You&rsquo;re inside the head so much that you don&rsquo;t need to tag thoughts in any way: they flow naturally from how the character narrates the story.</p><p>At the same time, this progression was necessary to fully appreciate introspection. The first few stories I wrote using inline thoughts, I <em>really</em> struggled to make them work and flow naturally. For newer writers, perhaps for a first draft, tagged thoughts might be the simplest to employ.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Some do a mix of inline and untagged. Deliberate thoughts are inline, but &ldquo;sudden&rdquo; thoughts or realizations are in italics. I think this is fine, though it has confused some of my readers before.</p></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Whenever something happens in your story (of some significance), ask yourself how the character narrating this story would react. What would their thoughts be? What would their thinking process be?</p><p>If it&rsquo;s interesting and helps the story, add it through introspection.</p><p>In my experience, the amount of introspection goes up as your target audience grows up. Adult literature can have <em>so much</em> introspection that the story stands still for ten pages. Not my type of story, but it&rsquo;s pretty common. Kids literature might only have a few funny thoughts there and there.</p><p>Many of my stories are young adult, or for &ldquo;all ages&rdquo;, and employ a mix. There is quite some introspection, but never so much that the story comes to a standstill.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/description/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Description</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/pyramid-of-abstraction/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Pyramid of Abstraction</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
