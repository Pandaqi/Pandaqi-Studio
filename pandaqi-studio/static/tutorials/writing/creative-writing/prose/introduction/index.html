Why? Firstly, because the original version was from <em>years</em> ago, when I was just starting out as a writer. It wasn&rsquo;t great. Secondly, because this topic presented a unique dilemma.</p><p>In my experience, understanding Prose has two distinct parts.</p><ul><li>How to actually <em>get your thoughts onto the paper</em>.</li><li>How to make that Prose <em>as strong and beautiful as possible</em>.</li></ul><p>Even the most experienced writers&mdash;those who have written hundreds of books&mdash;aren&rsquo;t able to get their thoughts onto the page <em>perfectly</em> the first time. Their first version of a story has mediocre Prose at best. And that&rsquo;s fine! It&rsquo;s more important to <em>get something on the paper</em>, as you can always improve the Prose later. You can&rsquo;t rewrite a blank page!</p><h2 id=course-structure>Course Structure</h2><p>This means, however, that this course has two different parts. And I had to decide with which part to start and how to integrate both.</p><p>What did I decide?</p><ul><li>The first few chapters are extremely <em>practical</em>. They are about the absolute basics needed to get your thoughts onto the paper.</li><li>The later chapters are more <em>theoretical</em> (and in-depth). They give tips, tricks, and guidelines to <em>improve</em> that messy Prose.</li></ul><p>The idea is <em>not</em> to memorize those chapters. It&rsquo;s too much information! You won&rsquo;t be able to keep all those &ldquo;rules&rdquo; in your head as you write that first draft anyway.</p><p>Instead,</p><ul><li>Just write your first draft however you want. Get those ideas onto the page!</li><li>Let your work sit for a while. (Don&rsquo;t look at it for a day, a week, a month.)</li><li>Then revise, while keeping those theoretical chapters as a reference. Pick a few rules for &ldquo;good prose&rdquo; you want to follow and check your whole text for these.</li></ul><p>As you repeat this loop, writing more and more, you will build an intuition for good prose automatically. The &ldquo;rules&rdquo; (and when to break them) will be burned into your brain and you can use them subconsciously as you write the first draft.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>A very common rule is to avoid using the word &ldquo;very&rdquo;. Instead of saying &ldquo;very loud&rdquo;, use a single word like &ldquo;deafening&rdquo;. I made this mistake a lot in my first stories. Even though I&rsquo;d heard this rule numerous times, it was <em>too much</em> for my brain to take into account as I wrote the first version.</p><p>Then I wrote 5+ stories and edited out &ldquo;very&rdquo; in the second draft. That simple practice taught me the rule on a more intrinsic level, and now I will usually avoid &ldquo;very&rdquo; on the first try.</p></div><p>That&rsquo;s how I structured the course. That&rsquo;s how I recommend improving your Prose. I will mention it again when we reach this midway point (after which chapters become about in-depth tricks to apply when revising).</p><p>As they say: <em>All writing is rewriting.</em></p><p>When you just start out as a writer, this often sounds pretentious or wrong. Surely, most of the work is, you know, those 80,000 words you initially invented!? How can all writing be rewriting?</p><p>As you gain experience, however, you see the truth in this. It&rsquo;s very important to get the text onto the paper, as quickly and effortlessly as possible, which naturally means you make mistakes and your prose is awful. The other 90% of the work comes from revising and improving that first draft.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re able to accept this&mdash;if you&rsquo;re able to have this mind-set from the get-go&mdash;you will become much more prolific and active as a writer.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Aside from some things you really need to know to form a sentence, this course is <strong>not</strong> about <a href=../../english/>Grammar</a>.</p></div><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet, I recommend reading the <a href=../../storytelling/>Storytelling</a> course first. It&rsquo;s a practical guide for beginners that talks about the entire process of writing a book from start to finish. Where possible, it links to more specific courses such as <a href=../../plot/>Plot</a>, <a href=../../character/>Character</a>, <a href=../../worldbuilding/>Worldbuilding</a>, or this one.</p></div><h2 id=two-types-of-prose>Two Types of Prose</h2><p>In general, people distinguish two types of prose: <strong>clear window</strong> and <strong>stained glass window</strong>.</p><p>The first type (also called <em>Orwellian prose</em>) is practical and efficient. You write down the story as objectively as possible. You don&rsquo;t add lots of figures of speech, imagery, style, or other flourishes.</p><p>The second type (also called <em>purple prose</em>) is the opposite. You obfuscate the true meaning or the facts of your writing, by adding lots of style and subjective language.</p><p>With Orwellian prose, the idea is that the author isn&rsquo;t there. It&rsquo;s all about the story, not about how it&rsquo;s told or who tells it. This allows you to use <em>complex ideas</em> (because of the simple, direct language) and leads to shorter prose. The downside is that it&rsquo;s bland and has no personality.</p><p>Purple prose is, obviously, the opposite. The <em>way</em> the story is told is just as important as the actual story. Tone, style and atmosphere come alive. It allows you to do many awesome and unique things &mldr; at the risk of making the story muddy and unclear, the sentences much longer and more complicated.</p><p>This course focuses on Orwellian prose. It&rsquo;s the most common type, because of how efficient and accessible it is. Use it when you desire to reach as large an audience as possible.</p><p>It is also, to me, the right <em>starting point</em>. Once you have your story down in simple and direct language, you can always &ldquo;stylize&rdquo; it later. You can always turn sections into purple prose later, for which I also provide a lot of tips near the end. The other way around is harder.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It is, therefore, also my personal writing style. You might have noticed that already when reading this. I like to keep sentences short and direct, my vocabulary simple and practical.</p></div><p>Let&rsquo;s get started!</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-overview secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Course Overview</div><div class="right-block style-overview secondary-style-"><ol class=overview><li><span class=counter>1</span>
