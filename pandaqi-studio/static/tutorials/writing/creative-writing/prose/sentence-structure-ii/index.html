Probably the most important set of tips and advice about prose you will ever encounter. So let&rsquo;s not waste more time on an introduction and dive right into another crucial tip.</p><h2 id=remove-sensing-verbs>Remove sensing verbs</h2><p>If &ldquo;vary your sentence length&rdquo; was the mother of all writing advice, then this is surely the eldest daughter. (Not sure how well that metaphor works, but we&rsquo;re going with it.)</p><p>Whenever you tell a story, you&rsquo;re telling it <em>through the eyes of the narrator</em>. Unless you have an omniscient narrator&mdash;who is objective and stands outside the narrative&mdash;this point of view will come from a main character within the story.</p><p>This means two things.</p><ul><li>How they tell the story might not be entirely <em>true</em>. This reveals their character even more. Use that!</li><li>They can only tell things that they experience. This means any <strong>sensing verb</strong> (such as &ldquo;see&rdquo; or &ldquo;hear&rdquo;) is a waste of space.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I see birds flying overhead.&rdquo; => &ldquo;Bird fly overhead.&rdquo;</p></div><p>You&rsquo;re telling the story! The only reason you can mention the birds, is because you <em>see</em> them! There&rsquo;s no reason for characters to add sensing verbs.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He hears rustling leaves and decides to turn on his flashlight.&rdquo; => &ldquo;Rustling leaves cause him to turn on his flashlight.&rdquo;</p></div><p>The only reason you mention rustling leaves, is because you <em>hear</em> them! No need to explain how hearing works with every sentence.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I feel her leg sliding against mine.&rdquo; => &ldquo;Her leg slides against mine.&rdquo;</p></div><p>The idea remains the same with all these examples.</p><p>Remove sensing verbs to make sentences shorter and simpler. Also do it to increase immersion and <em>really</em> get into the skin of the character narrating the story.</p><h2 id=keep-related-words-together>Keep related words together</h2><p>Certain sayings, verbs or clauses consist of multiple words. As your head is formulating a sentence, it might be tempted to <em>push these words apart</em>.</p><p>This is not recommended. Keep related parts of the sentence together. Proximity is a <em>great</em> tool to help the reader understand what parts of the text relate to each other. (Similarly, move things <em>further</em> apart to make sure the reader knows they&rsquo;re unrelated.)</p><p>When does this mistake generally happen?</p><ul><li><strong>Infinitive</strong>: a construction of &ldquo;to + verb&rdquo;, where the two elements are separated.</li><li><strong>Split verb</strong>: a construction where the verb requires a preposition.</li><li><strong>Object</strong>: if the verb is done <em>to</em> someone, we call them the object. Put them as close to subject + verb as you can.</li><li><strong>Pronouns + Antecedents</strong>: a pronoun references something from earlier. Put the thing it references as <em>close</em> before it as possible. This also prevents confusion about <em>what</em> the pronoun references.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>INFINITIVE: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to, I don&rsquo;t know, foolishly jump from the highest rooftop.&rdquo;</p><p>TOGETHER: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to jump from the highest rooftop, you fool.&rdquo;</p></div><p>The first version of the sentence can be a very colorful way for a character to speak. But for clarity, it&rsquo;s awful.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>SPLIT VERB: &ldquo;He decided to split the chickens up&rdquo;</p><p>TOGETHER: &ldquo;He decided to split up the chickens&rdquo;</p></div><p>Another reason why you don&rsquo;t want to end sentences with prepositions. (As explained in the previous chapter.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>OBJECT: &ldquo;He threw the ball, as fast as possible, which still meant a lousy pace for him, to his teammate.&rdquo;</p><p>TOGETHER: &ldquo;He threw the ball to his teammate, as fast as possible, though that still meant a lousy pace.&rdquo;</p></div><p>The first version might seem fun (again). But do this for a whole book, and it just becomes a mess that&rsquo;s near impossible to sift through. Prefer clarity and branching to the right.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>PRONOUN: &ldquo;James was a great musician and the best friend of John. He was the youngest graduate of the local conservatory.&rdquo;</p><p>What does &ldquo;he&rdquo; refer to in the second sentence? James or John?</p><p>TOGETHER: &ldquo;James was a great musician and the youngest graduate of the local conservatory. John was his best friend.&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=control-your-lists>Control your lists</h2><p>A good way to make your prose more <em>efficient</em> is to present information as a list (within one sentence). It prevents having to repeat subject or verb, or use pronouns to refer to previous sentences.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;Sarah was smart. She was also young and fashionable.&rdquo; => &ldquo;Sarah was smart, young and fashionable.&rdquo;</p></div><p>The meaning of a sentence, however, changes based on how many elements you mention.</p><h3 id=one>One</h3><p>Giving only <em>one</em> piece of information is obviously the most <strong>powerful</strong> and <strong>focused</strong>. That one statement surely reaches the reader.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She was strong.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My son bursts with energy.</p></div><h3 id=two>Two</h3><p>Giving <em>two</em> pieces of information automatically creates a <strong>comparison</strong> or <strong>contrast</strong>. The reader will automatically equate them or compare them.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She was strong and smart.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My son bursts with energy, but learned to stay calm.</p></div><h3 id=three>Three</h3><p>Giving <em>three</em> pieces of information feels the most <strong>complete</strong> and <strong>full</strong>. Three is a crowd. There&rsquo;s a reason many speeches talk in triplets. It feels satisfying to us.</p><p>Similarly, a common narrative structure is to have an event happen <em>three</em> times in your plot. First time, the hero fails, but learns nothing. Second time, they fail, but finally change their ways. Third time, they succeed.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She was strong, smart and adventurous.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My son bursts with energy, but learned to stay calm and relaxed.</p></div><h3 id=four>Four</h3><p>If your sentence has <em>four</em> pieces of information &mldr; you want to rethink it. Any time I encounter such a sentence in a book&mdash;one that lists off a bunch of related things&mdash;my eyes glaze over and none of it sticks.</p><p>If you <em>do</em> go for this, consider some punctuation to help yourself out. Turn the list into something more structured.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She had it all: strong, smart, adventurous, friendly, and even humorous.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Even when my son bursts with energy, he stays calm, relaxed, and assesses his options&mdash;just like I trained him.</p></div><h2 id=phrases-that-grow-on-verbs>Phrases that grow on verbs</h2><p>People tend to hide their true statement in a sea of words. Especially people who are reserved or afraid to commit to something. In prose, this merely doubles the word count, while removing clarity.</p><p>This is best exemplified through phrases that &ldquo;grow on verbs&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=trying--doing>Trying = Doing</h3><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: Sarah tries to open the door. The attacker tries to block it with his arm and wins.</p><p>SHORT: Sarah opens the door. The attacker blocks it with is arm.</p></div><p>&ldquo;Trying&rdquo; to do something &mldr; just means doing something. When you use &ldquo;try&rdquo;, you usually signal that they might <em>fail</em>. More efficient prose is to simply <em>do</em> something, then show that it failed the next sentence.</p><p>Sometimes, there&rsquo;s a verb that means &ldquo;trying to do X&rdquo;. One verb is better than two verbs (and shorter), so use it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: Mark tries to grab the gun.</p><p>SHORT: Mark reaches for the gun.</p></div><h3 id=other-examples>Other examples</h3><p>Other examples are constructions with <em>seems to, tends to, should have to, might want to, &mldr;</em></p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: He tends to enjoy long walks on the beach, but he seems distracted today.</p><p>SHORT: He enjoys long walks on the beach, but today he&rsquo;s distracted.</p></div><p>The idea is simply to check if your sentence has multiple verbs, some of which don&rsquo;t really mean anything. In most cases, you can just rewrite to leave them out, and the prose becomes stronger.</p><h2 id=nouns-containing-verbs>Nouns containing Verbs</h2><p>Most languages have a way to turn verbs into nouns. <em>To judge</em> has the noun <em>judgment</em>. <em>To observe</em> has the noun <em>observation</em>.</p><p>A sentence becomes shorter and simpler if you use the <strong>verb</strong> instead of the <strong>noun</strong>, if possible.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;It is the judgment of the panel that your presentation was awful.&rdquo; => &ldquo;The panel judges your presentation to be awful.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;It is up for consideration.&rdquo; => &ldquo;He considers it.&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=extra-spice>Extra spice</h2><p>In my view, crystal clear and simple prose is the <em>starting point</em>. That&rsquo;s the base level you want to set.</p><p>Because if you do, you are free to <em>tweak</em> the prose throughout your novel to be slightly more fancy or advanced. You know that 95% of it is super clear and simple. This gives you the freedom to mess this up here and there.</p><p>Try a different sentence structure. Try some new words or phrasings. See if you can add more rhythm or flow to a text by describing things in a different way that might be &ldquo;less efficient&rdquo;.</p><p>A unique writing <em>style</em> is one of the benefits authors can have. It&rsquo;s something unique to books, something that can make <em>your</em> prose stand out. So even though these tips are great guidelines for at least 80% of your prose, you <em>should</em> experiment with adding your own flair and breaking these rules.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>If we&rsquo;re honest, it&rsquo;s perhaps my greatest area of improvement. I write extremely efficient and practical, which means I don&rsquo;t have a clear style and don&rsquo;t really get poetic or stylish. It means that I sometimes write a story and ask myself: &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t literally any other author have written it this way? Why would people buy <em>my</em> books?&rdquo;</p></div><p>How would you add this extra spice?</p><ul><li>Using <a href=../tropes>Tropes</a> (next chapter) or figurative language. Things such as metaphors, puns, anticlimax, etcetera.</li><li>Changing your <strong>overall perspective</strong>. Any event, any part of your world, can be narrated in infinitely many ways. As a writer, you choose your focus and your angle into the story. Picking a unique angle (say, narrating a story from the perspective of a <em>building</em>) automatically leads to a unique writing style.</li><li>Go for the thing that is <strong>interesting</strong>. If it&rsquo;s interesting to you, it will be interesting to others who like your style or way of storytelling. So lean into that.</li><li>Go for the thing that is <strong>odd</strong>. A million writers have written about the night being dark and the wind feeling like a hurricane bla bla. Find the odd description. Find what&rsquo;s extraordinary about this event, this character, this paragraph you&rsquo;re writing. Lean into that with utmost sincerity. Write about the night feeling lighter than the day or an actual hurricane your main character barely feels.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>That concludes the two chapters on sentence structure. Applying these techniques will surely save you hundreds of thousands of words. For free! And the prose only becomes <em>clearer</em> and <em>nicer</em> to read.</p><p>In the end, the lesson I&rsquo;ve learned about <em>all</em> art is this: <em>Clarity trumps all.</em></p><p>If your audience has no clue what they&rsquo;re even reading, your story could be amazing and they&rsquo;d never know. If your audience doesn&rsquo;t understand how cool your first chapter is, they&rsquo;ll put the book away and never move past it.</p><p>When in doubt, read back what you wrote and ask yourself what the <em>point</em> of this paragraph is. If the text itself doesn&rsquo;t clearly prove the reason for its existence, you either have muddy prose, or prose that can be cut from the story entirely.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/sentence-structure-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Sentence Structure I</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/tropes/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>Tropes</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
