This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. A writer simply aims to pick the <em>precise</em> words needed to convey their story. A basic vocabulary is enough for 90% of prose, if you train yourself to access your full vocabulary.</p><p>Longer sentences and more complicated words are not &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;more professional&rdquo;. No, they are worse! A truly skilled writer can convey a thought with a few short and simple sentences, while the amateur needs five paragraphs to get the same idea across.</p><p>As such, almost all the tips below have the same goal: make your writing <em>shorter</em>. Because shorter is almost always better.</p><h2 id=use-simple-tense>Use simple tense</h2><p>Write using <strong>simple present</strong> or <strong>simple past</strong> as much as you can. It&rsquo;s more immediate, more active, and requires fewer words.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He had finished work.&rdquo; => &ldquo;He finished work.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;As she was walking to her front door, she was listening to a podcast.&rdquo; => &ldquo;She listened to a podcast and walked to her front door.&rdquo;</p></div><p>At first, it might seem a little too efficient. After applying this methodology to a few of your old stories, you&rsquo;ll grow accustomed to it and realize how many words you can save!</p><h2 id=use-active-sentences>Use active sentences</h2><p>This is why I taught you to think about &ldquo;subject + verb&rdquo; before anything else. It makes sentences much shorter and easier to follow. The sentence is written from the viewpoint of the one <em>doing</em> the action.</p><p>Otherwise, many (beginning) writers are tempted to write &ldquo;passive sentences&rdquo;. The sentence is written from the viewpoint of the one <em>receiving</em> or <em>undergoing</em> the action.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>PASSIVE: Mark was hit by John.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>ACTIVE: John hit Mark.</p></div><p>Such sentences are always <em>longer</em> and <em>more convoluted</em>. Unless you want to stress the importance of the &ldquo;victim&rdquo;, or the subject is unknown, always pick active voice.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>PASSIVE: She was hit by a stream of water from somebody emptying a bucket on the balcony above her head.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>ACTIVE: On the balcony overhead, somebody emptied a bucket. The stream of water hit her.</p></div><h2 id=single-word-same-meaning>Single word, same meaning</h2><p>A first draft often contains groups of words that have a better alternative: a <em>single</em> word with the same meaning.</p><h3 id=avoid-very>Avoid very</h3><p>The biggest culprit is the word <strong>very</strong> (and similar modifiers). Try to eliminate it as much as possible.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Very afraid => Terrified</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Very risky => Perilous</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Extreme pain => Agony</p></div><h3 id=avoid-adverbs>Avoid adverbs</h3><p>The second biggest culprit are <strong>adverbs</strong>. These change the meaning of a verb. Sometimes, you really need them. But often there is a single <strong>verb</strong> that contains this modified meaning.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He looked intensely for hours.&rdquo; => &ldquo;He <em>stared</em> for hours.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;She walked slowly to the window.&rdquo; => &ldquo;She shuffled to the window.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;We spoke softly about the incident.&rdquo; => &ldquo;We whispered about the incident.&rdquo;</p></div><p>As you see, this mostly happens with adverbs that merely <em>intensify</em> rather than modify meaning. (Think of: <em>just, certainly, entirely, completely, exactly, &mldr;</em>) You want to cut those most of the time.</p><p>Similarly, verbs exist that need multiple parts, which have an alternative that is <em>one</em> word. Pick the one word, as it&rsquo;s usually easier to read.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He tried to make this position clear.&rdquo; => &ldquo;He tried to clarify his position.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;She added up all the expenses&rdquo; => &ldquo;She calculated the expenses.&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=the-most-specific-verb>The most specific verb</h2><p>This is related to the previous section, but not necessarily the same.</p><p>Some verbs are more &ldquo;general use&rdquo; than others. They can be used in many different contexts and sentences, whereas other words have a more precise meaning that only fits in a few situations. Whenever possible, pick the more <em>precise</em> one.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The verb &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; can mean many different things. It can mean physically avoiding contact. It can be avoiding a task. It can be preventing a future event from happening.</p><p>If I&rsquo;m writing a physical fighting scene, I would opt for more specific verbs such as &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; or &ldquo;step aside&rdquo;. With equally many words, you convey <em>more</em> information. It also adds more variety the the overall prose.</p></div><h2 id=positive-statements>Positive Statements</h2><p>Many times, writers create <em>negative</em> statements by adding the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; (or something similar) in there. This adds extra words! And it requires more effort from the reader, as they must invert the sentence. (It gets even worse when you do a <em>double negative</em>.)</p><p>When possible, keep your sentences <em>positive</em>.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>NEGATIVE: He didn&rsquo;t think studying Math was of much use.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>POSITIVE: He thought studying Math was useless.</p></div><p>Negative statements are fine to highlight contrast, denial or a character being very reserved. Sometimes, it just sounds more natural. As with all these rules, they can be broken, once you understand them.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>NEGATIVE: I would not mind staying the night at your place.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>POSITIVE: I want to stay the night at your place.</p></div><h2 id=pick-the-shorter-word>Pick the shorter word</h2><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s how strict we are! Don&rsquo;t even waste a <em>syllable</em>!</p><p>Many words have synonyms. Unless you have a good reason to pick longer options, pick the shortest one.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;He utilized the calculator.&rdquo; => &ldquo;He used the calculator.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;She abandoned her post.&rdquo; => &ldquo;She left her post.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Again, this might seem extreme. If you, however, apply this to a whole first draft, you can easily save more than 20,000 words without actually changing any of the meaning. That is worth more, 99% of the time, than using a fancy word or phrase.</p><h2 id=cut-vague-or-unnecessary-details>Cut vague or unnecessary details</h2><p>And of course, the best option is to completely <em>remove</em> words that don&rsquo;t need to be there.</p><p>The easiest ones to spot are unnecessary details. Parts of a sentence that communicate something the reader already <em>knows</em> or that say something irrelevant to the current story.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: He saw the building collapse. The collapsed building was immediately captured by tourists who whipped out their smartphones.</p><p>Double usage of &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t add anything. What&rsquo;s the point saying they &ldquo;whipped out their smartphones&rdquo;? Does it matter how the smartphone ended up in their hand? (Also, passive voice.)</p><p>SHORT: He saw the building collapse. Tourists immediately captured it with their smartphone.</p></div><p>Vague language is harder to spot. It refers to words or phrases that do add meaning, but it&rsquo;s a <em>vague</em> meaning. And we don&rsquo;t like vagueness: either say something concrete or say nothing at all.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>VAGUE: She extended her hand a tiny bit and swallowed the medicine after waiting for a moment or two.</p><p>What is &ldquo;a tiny bit&rdquo;? What is &ldquo;a moment or two&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s saying something without actually saying something. Either say nothing or make the details <em>specific</em>.</p><p>SPECIFIC: She extended her hand and waited a heartbeat to swallow the medicine.</p></div><h2 id=extra-spice>Extra spice</h2><p>After writing your first draft, after following the guidelines above, you can think about adding that extra &ldquo;spice&rdquo; to your prose.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easier to add spice to a dish that already tastes well, than to try and create a tasty dish with zero foundation.</p><p>You can play with words. You can find original, unique ways to say something. You can throw in some rare, unknown word here and there.</p><p>In this stage, you usually want to look out for clichés. Phrases that contain the <em>first</em> words any person (writer or not) would think of. When that happens, try to find synonyms, free associate, maybe create a word web until you find a more original expression.</p><p>Another technique is to imitate the style of another writer. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to &ldquo;be inspired&rdquo; by another&rsquo;s work: it&rsquo;s one of the most powerful learning tools and you&rsquo;d shoot yourself in the foot for not using it. As you attempt to do so, you&rsquo;ll surely make mistakes or add your own flair. You might think you clearly &ldquo;stole&rdquo; someone else&rsquo;s style, but nobody else will even notice as your work is so different.</p><p>A more specific tip is to be playful with your <strong>names</strong>. The names of characters/objects/locations will be reused more than anything else in a story. So pick something that &mldr;</p><ul><li>Isn&rsquo;t too long</li><li>Sounds really nice and fits the prose or setting</li><li>Is clearly distinct from other names in the story</li><li>And has more meaning (such as foreshadowing character, or a plot twist)</li></ul><p>It always frustrates me a little when somebody writes a really good fantasy story set in medieval times, but the main character is just called &ldquo;Mark&rdquo;. And their name obviously appears thousands of times throughout the whole book. It doesn&rsquo;t fit. It subtracts from the story. Simply picking any other name would be a massive improvement to the overall prose.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, you have those who believe fantasy names should be some incomprehensible mess like &ldquo;Shac-ti-laka-bu-BONG&rdquo;. Yeah, no, if you <em>really</em> want to go for that, give the character a really short nickname like &ldquo;Shac&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/how-to-revise/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>How to Revise</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/punctuation/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Punctuation</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
