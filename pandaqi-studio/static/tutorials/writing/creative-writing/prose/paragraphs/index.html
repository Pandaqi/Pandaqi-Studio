Well, if there could be a second backbone, it would be <em>paragraphs</em>. This chapter will also be quite dense, but will contain my other batch of tips and advice that might revolutionize your prose.</p><h2 id=prevent-the-wall-of-text>Prevent the Wall of Text</h2><p>I mentioned before how each paragraph should be <em>one idea</em>. Whenever the prose changes to a different topic, start a new paragraph. Group sentences related to the same topic, split sentences that are not related.</p><p>This is, however, a bit subjective. What is &ldquo;one idea&rdquo;? When are sentences related <em>enough</em> to be grouped?</p><p>There is no hard rule for this. It comes down to personal preference and writing style, as well as intuition you&rsquo;ll build as you write more and more.</p><p>The general rule, however, is that you <strong>never want a wall of text</strong>. You never want a paragraph to become so long that it covers most of a page and just feels <em>exhausting</em> or <em>daunting</em> to the reader. In general, this means keeping paragraphs under 150&ndash;200 words.</p><p>You <em>especially</em> don&rsquo;t want a wall of text on your first few pages. The reader is giving you the benefit of the doubt. They&rsquo;re giving your book the slightest of chances and now try to jump into your world. Present them with lots of whitespace, short sentences and short paragraphs. Leave the rest for <em>later</em>, when the reader is already invested.</p><p>An easy way to add more whitespace is through <strong>dialogue</strong>. Be liberal with adding dialogue to your first few pages, to make the prose look more inviting.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I&rsquo;m also a graphic designer. This taught me that <em>presentation</em> is equally important as <em>content</em>. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;waste of time&rdquo; to put effort into shaping the whitespace around your prose. I sometimes even change the meaning of paragraphs just so they look less daunting.</p><p>Similarly, when I am programming, I&rsquo;m often equally concerned with writing code that <em>looks</em> pretty and clean ;)</p></div><h2 id=also-prevent-single-sentence-paragraphs>Also prevent single-sentence paragraphs</h2><p>The whole idea of paragraphs is to add hierarchy and structure. To group sentences together into related thoughts and events, which helps readers understand the story. Without them, it becomes <em>much</em> harder to understand any text.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>And of course, the hierarchy continues. We have &ldquo;scenes&rdquo; to group related paragraphs, then &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; to group related scenes, and so forth. All to guide the reader through this wealth of written information.</p></div><p>As such, mostly writing paragraphs with just a single line also isn&rsquo;t the solution. Try to consistently write <em>at least</em> two sentences in each paragraph.</p><p>This way, you also reserve the single-sentence paragraph for when it truly matters: when something <em>really important</em> happens and you want to draw attention to it.</p><p>Instead of thinking &ldquo;as short as possible&rdquo;, use paragraph length consciously for the desired effect.</p><ul><li><strong>Long</strong> paragraphs feel slower, calmer, more thoughtful and introspective</li><li><strong>Short</strong> paragraphs feel faster, urgent, more intense and action oriented</li></ul><h2 id=focus-through-rearranging>Focus through rearranging</h2><p>Okay, so a paragraph should be <em>focused</em> one one thing. New thought? New paragraph. New event? New paragraph.</p><p>In reality, this is not so clear-cut. I might have a <em>sequence</em> of actions which all belong to the same <em>general</em> action.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My main character is chasing somebody else through a crowd. Even though all their action is related (&ldquo;chasing&rdquo;), they will be different actions (pushing people aside, looking around, running, &mldr;).</p></div><p>Do I create one huge paragraph with all the actions? Do I start a new paragraph for each one? No, that would mean single-sentence paragraphs for a whole page.</p><p>It&rsquo;s up to your personal judgment whether sentences are &ldquo;related enough&rdquo; to have the same focus. The best method, however, is to try and <strong>avoid</strong> this issue altogether.</p><p>How?</p><ul><li>Mix your prose types, as I advised before. (After giving an action, give a thought or a description related to it. Then you&rsquo;re free to write the next action beat on a <em>new</em> paragraph.)</li><li>Rearrange sentences to clump things together based on what is &ldquo;most related to each other&rdquo;.</li></ul><p>A large part of rewriting is just rearranging. It&rsquo;s usually easy to tell if sentence A is more closely related to sentence B or sentence C. Put things together based on the &ldquo;best match&rdquo; and you will already get focused paragraphs of acceptable length.</p><p>Be mindful of errors that appear when rearranging. You might forget to add the right punctuation, or a pronoun suddenly refers to the wrong thing. Always carefully double-check the new paragraph.</p><p>Almost <em>all</em> my grammar mistakes&mdash;sometimes quite egregious ones&mdash;come from my <em>second draft</em>, after rearranging paragraphs or sentence parts.</p><h2 id=mistake-awkward-word-repetition>Mistake: awkward word repetition</h2><p>In the chapter on <a href=../sentence-structure-i/>Sentence Structure</a>, I recommended to vary your word usage. To prevent awkward repetition within a sentence or chain of sentences.</p><p>Well, the same is true for <em>paragraphs</em>. The most annoying one is when two subsequent paragraphs <strong>start with the same word</strong>.</p><p>Readers notice this. It takes them out of the story. It&rsquo;s a pattern they can&rsquo;t help but see&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a meaningless pattern!</p><p>Look out for this. Always try to start the next paragraph with a different set of words. (The same thing is true for ending a paragraph, but accidentally ending in an identical way is very rare.)</p><p>But I will recommend the same thing as before: it&rsquo;s better to <em>avoid</em> the issue entirely!</p><h3 id=always-keep-pov-in-mind>Always keep POV in mind</h3><p>When writing, keep in mind the POV ( = the point of view character) at all times. Write everything through <em>their</em> eyes.</p><p>This naturally leads to more varied and unique word choices. Because there are words <em>this</em> character would use that another would not. Because there are details <em>this</em> character would notice and another would not.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Somebody with an art background might describe a painting as &ldquo;a wonderful portrait in the style of impressionism&rdquo;. Another might just call it &ldquo;a painting&rdquo;. Somebody with an absolute disregard for art might call it &ldquo;a waste of money and effort staring him in the face at all times&rdquo;.</p></div><p>I like to take this even further.</p><p>Go for descriptions/action/thoughts <em>unique</em> to the thing currently happening. Use the setting, the characters present, objects present. This is the best way to avoid clichés or repetitive prose.</p><blockquote><p>Fill paragraphs (and chapters) with prose that could ONLY appear there and nowhere else.</p></blockquote><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Say you want to show that a character is nervous. Common, cliché prose would be something like &ldquo;their eye twitches&rdquo; or &ldquo;their posture is tense&rdquo;. But &mldr; you could write that anywhere! For anyone! You might accidentally write it fifty times in the same story.</p><p>Instead, show the nervousness in a way unique to this scene. It&rsquo;s in a forest? Have them break twigs all the time. This character wears unique clothing? Have them pulk at it, play with it, whenever they get nervous.</p><p>Not only does it avoid the awkward repetition, it multitasks by reinforcing all other elements of the story.</p></div><p>Finally, you can show character as well through paragraph <em>length</em>. If a character cares about something, they&rsquo;ll go on about it for longer. If something is relevant to the scene, but the character doesn&rsquo;t particularly care, they&rsquo;ll give an efficient and short paragraph and that&rsquo;s that.</p><h2 id=mistake-tell-then-show>Mistake: tell, then show</h2><p>I still regularly fail to catch this mistake, because I only discovered it recently. It was an eye-opener, though.</p><p>In school (or non-fiction in general), you are often taught the following.</p><ul><li>Start a paragraph with a summary or succinct point.</li><li>Use the rest of the paragraph to <em>expand</em> on that.</li></ul><p>For example, you&rsquo;d say &ldquo;Prices have risen to new heights this year&rdquo; (a general, abstract statement) and then use the rest of the paragraph to give examples, arguments, supporting evidence, and other text that expands this general statement.</p><p>This is great for <em>maximum clarity</em>! That&rsquo;s why we do it in non-fiction!</p><p>In stories, however, you are not only <em>allowed</em> to leave things up to the reader, it&rsquo;s even <em>preferred</em> to &ldquo;engage&rdquo; the reader and have them work for their meal. That&rsquo;s where the old writer&rsquo;s adage &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; comes from: instead of literally telling the reader what happened and how to feel, show interesting things and make them piece it together themselves.</p><p>In other words, if you find yourself writing paragraphs like this, you can shorten them.</p><ul><li>Either pick the summary sentence that <em>tells</em> (if that&rsquo;s enough for your purposes or you don&rsquo;t want to make it any longer)</li><li>Or pick the explanation that <em>shows</em> your point (but leave the summary behind)</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: Many homes were destroyed. The home of the Greens family burned down, while the villa of the Dumont family came shattered in an earthquake.</p><p>You&rsquo;re saying the same thing twice. First abstract, then concrete. The opposite order of what I taught you with the Pyramid of Abstraction! You can just leave out one of the pieces.</p><p>SHORT: The home of the Greens family burned down, while the villa of the Dumont family came shattered in an earthquake.</p><p>SHORT: Many homes were destroyed.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: He was afraid of the dark. Before entering, he grabbed his smartphone and searched for the flashlight. His fingers moved in such a frenzy that he dropped the thing twice before finally finding the right button.</p><p>You get the idea. Either be quick and literal about it (&ldquo;he was afraid of the dark&rdquo;), or use concrete details to <em>show</em> this, but don&rsquo;t waste time doing both.</p></div><p>As I said, if you do both, it <em>does</em> lead to maximum clarity. So feel free to keep this structure for more complicated paragraphs that you really want the reader to understand.</p><h2 id=mistake-exhaustive-listing>Mistake: exhaustive listing</h2><p>This is another leftover from non-fiction or academic writing. (I studied Applied Mathematics, which is why I struggled with this big time.)</p><p>When writing a report or research, you want to be as <em>complete</em> as possible. You want to mention every option, every possibility, and be 100% correct about it. This often leads to clunky, long sentences in which you list all the options.</p><p>In prose, this isn&rsquo;t needed. Whenever I encounter a long list of options in a book, my eyes glaze over and I usually skip it.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>In a sci-fi book I read recently, there was a sentence near the start that listed every organization involved in some scheme or branch within the world. It was just 10+ names in a row&mdash;most of them long and unfamiliar&mdash;which you really don&rsquo;t want. No reader can even process that, let alone remember it and have fun doing so.</p></div><p>But it also happens at a smaller scale. Giving two or three possible options within a sentence, where giving one option would be perfectly fine.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Recently, I edited a short story with a sentence like this: &ldquo;Just like the First Conflict left a black hole at all the places where trees, flowers or grass used to grow.&rdquo;</p><p>Why <em>trees, flowers or grass</em>? Why name three possible things that might grow somewhere? It just complicates the sentence without adding much meaning.</p><p>I can replace that with just &ldquo;nature&rdquo;. I can even replace it with just one of the options&mdash;the reader understands the general idea, and that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p></div><p>The solution is simply to pick <em>one</em> thing and stick with that. Find the best word to represent this list of words you had before, and only use that one word. (I even like to make things <em>plural</em> to remove &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;the&rdquo; from a sentence.)</p><p>You might feel like you&rsquo;re leaving out crucial information or not being &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. But listing all the options just means the reader will remember <em>none</em> of them, and the prose becomes twice as long for no reason.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>LONG: The box looked strange and unusual, the material rough like rusted metal or even frayed cloth.</p><p>This might seem good. You&rsquo;re giving the reader a lot of imagery and details to work with. But they are <em>competing</em> details. Listing multiple options makes it look like <em>you</em>, the writer, don&rsquo;t even know what you really want. It adds lots of words and uncertainty that doesn&rsquo;t need to be there.</p><p>Pick one thing, stick to it.</p><p>SHORT: The material of the strange box felt rough, like rusted metal.</p></div><h2 id=mistake-melodramatic>Mistake: Melodramatic</h2><p>Many writers tend to go for <em>big, emotional words</em> when they want to be really emotional. This often comes off as melodramatic and has the opposite effect: it feels funny, like a parody.</p><p>Instead, the opposite is true.</p><ul><li><strong>Back off</strong> when talking about serious topics. Be honest and true, don&rsquo;t use fancy words or phrases, understate.</li><li><strong>Show off</strong> when talking about topics that are not serious at all. Go wild with your language and imagination, exaggerate.</li></ul><p>Exaggeration and extreme prose lead to a funny, adventurous, humorous paragraph. Understatement and sincerity effectively create emotional or sad paragraphs.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/rhythm-flow/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Rhythm & Flow</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/scenes-chapters/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Scenes & Chapters</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
