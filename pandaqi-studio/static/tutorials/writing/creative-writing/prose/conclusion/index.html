You&rsquo;ve finished this course on Prose. Now go and write/read many more stories. It&rsquo;s the only way to keep improving your prose.</p><p>Use the tips from the first chapters to get your thoughts onto the page. Eliminate self-doubt, or criticism, or forcing yourself to follow any rules while writing that <em>first draft</em>.</p><p>Once done, take some time off. Then come back and, using this guide as reference, sharpen that prose through rewriting and even more rewriting.</p><p>I have written millions of words for many different projects and purposes. (Dutch and English, fiction and non-fiction, websites and novels, etcetera.) But I <em>still</em> mess up my prose in the first draft. I still write clunky paragraphs and lines that are twice as long as they need to be. That&rsquo;s a natural side-effect of trying to sort your thoughts and put them into coherent sentences.</p><p>With every book you write, you get better at delivering a clean first draft. But the issue never goes away&mdash;nobody gets things right the first time.</p><p>So, in short, how do you write great prose? Write terrible prose first, then improve it through hundreds of tips and techniques you learn over time.</p><p>As always, this course is part of a bigger category called <a href=../../../creative-writing/>Creative Writing</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t already, I recommend starting with the <a href=../../storytelling/>Storytelling</a> course that teaches how to write books from start to finish. It links to related topics (such as plotting or developing characters) wherever needed.</p><p>With these courses, I really tried to distill <em>everything</em> I know and learned from <em>years</em> of writing into practical and interesting articles.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>All writing courses combined have been the largest writing project I ever did. It was silly of me to think that it would just be &ldquo;a few weekends of work&rdquo;. And I still regularly think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stupid, I completely forgot to mention this one tip I learned, I need to add that!&rdquo;</p></div><p>Hopefully, I succeeded and helped a few people out there!</p><p>Keep learning and keep writing,</p><p>Pandaqi</p>
