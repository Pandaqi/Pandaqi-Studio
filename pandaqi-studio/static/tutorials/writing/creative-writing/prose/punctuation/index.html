Like many, they think it&rsquo;s some &ldquo;stupid rule&rdquo; about grammar that they need to memorize for &ldquo;no reason&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not the case and it doesn&rsquo;t help to view it like that. As if somebody, long ago, invented the semicolon just to annoy us until the end of time.</p><p>Punctuation was invented for a purpose. To clearly mark the different elements of prose as efficiently as possible. With just one symbol in the right spot, your prose becomes much easier to read and parse.</p><p>I guess the most important question is to ask yourself: &ldquo;Is my punctuation invisible?&rdquo; As soon as a reader <em>notices</em> you have punctuation somewhere, it&rsquo;s probably out of place or detracting from clarity. This question will also prevent you from overusing uncommon punctuation in an attempt to show off ;)</p><p>The true power of some of these punctuation elements will only be revealed in the next chapter on <a href=../sentence-structure>Sentence Structure</a>, when I can give more examples of good and bad usage.</p><h2 id=periods>Periods</h2><p>Periods (<code>.</code>) were invented for one purpose: to mark the end of a sentence.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t use it for anything else.</p><p>Any word next to a period (either the end of the previous sentence, or the start of a new one) is <em>emphasized</em>. The period acts as a small period where the reader can think and breathe for a bit, and whatever is around it will have some time to resonate. Therefore, place strong and important words at the <em>beginning</em> or <em>end</em> of sentences.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>In order to emphasize, one should place a word <strong>at the end.</strong></p></div><p>Many writers are taught to use <em>short</em> sentences to increase the pace of their prose. This is, however, a bad idea. My explanation above shows that the period is a strong <em>pause</em> for the reader. This means that many short sentences contain <em>a lot of pauses</em>, actually destroying the pace of your prose.</p><p>To me, a series of short sentences feels like it&rsquo;s &ldquo;impatient&rdquo; or &ldquo;in haste&rdquo;, more so than it feels fast or exciting.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He jumped. He nearly missed. The roof was slippery. He slid towards the chimney. A gun was fired. The bullet missed him. A hole appeared in the chimney. He climbed up and dove in.</p></div><h2 id=question-and-exclamation-marks>Question and Exclamation Marks</h2><p>Exclamation marks (<code>!</code>) should be used sparingly, for it is a lazy way of making a sentence more intense. If possible, show somebody&rsquo;s emotion or intensity through the prose itself.</p><p>Question marks (<code>?</code>) should be used for actual <em>questions</em>. They can also be used to shorten sentences.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;Why would he do that?&rdquo; (introspection) is shorter than &ldquo;She thought about why he would do that&rdquo;</p></div><p>Don&rsquo;t use multiple after each other. <em>&lsquo;How did you do that????&rsquo;</em> doesn&rsquo;t help clarify that the person in question is very surprised&mdash;it just makes the writing look childish.</p><h2 id=comma>Comma</h2><p>The comma (<code>,</code>) is the most natural way to create order in a sentence. It cuts a long sentence into manageable parts without interrupting the flow of the text.</p><p>Below are the four general situations in which a comma is used.</p><ul><li>To set off <strong>introductory elements.</strong> It can be omitted though if this introductory element is short.<ul><li><em>Falling down the tower,</em> he thought about his life.</li></ul></li><li>To set off <strong>parenthetical elements</strong>. Those are sub clauses that can be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence.<ul><li>The janitor, <em>who never learned how to drive a car</em>, couldn&rsquo;t find his keys.</li></ul></li><li>To connect two <strong>independent clauses.</strong><ul><li>He had never thought about it, and he wasn&rsquo;t going to do so this time.</li></ul></li><li>To separate elements in a <strong>series</strong> or <strong>list</strong>.<ul><li>He dropped the book, fled out of the building, and ran to his house.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=spliced-sentences>Spliced Sentences</h3><p>Perhaps the most common reason for &ldquo;muddy prose&rdquo; is the overuse of the comma. Writers connect two or three sentences, sometimes completely unrelated, with a comma. This leads to really long sentences without a clear point.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;The witch studied her foe, they looked badly prepared, and the sun set.&rdquo;</p><p>These are three different actions just mixed together with a quick comma. Instead, you might try something like this.</p><p>&ldquo;The witch studied her foe as the sun set. They looked badly prepared.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Remember that the <em>period</em> gives the reader a nice pause, while the <em>comma</em> barely adds a pause. When editing, you&rsquo;ll often be replacing commas with periods and splitting sentences into two. These are often called <strong>spliced sentences</strong> and discussed further in the next chapter about <a href=../sentence-structure>Sentence Structure</a>.</p><h3 id=comma-before-and>Comma before And?</h3><p>Another common question is whether to add a comma before &ldquo;and&rdquo;. My first stories did this all the time, which resulted in feedback that it was a bit jarring.</p><p>Why did I do it? Because the &ldquo;rule&rdquo; is &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;, which beginning writers usually can&rsquo;t deal with.</p><ul><li>In short sentences, you can <em>usually</em> leave out the comma. (Though it&rsquo;s technically allowed to keep it.)</li><li>In longer sentences, you will <em>often</em> need the comma to ensure clarity. (The better choice is often to rewrite.)</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;She grabbed her bag, and ran out the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Sentences like these would slip into my first draft all the time. But that comma adds an extra pause to the sentence that does nothing but slow down the reader. Remember we don&rsquo;t want interpunction that draws attention to itself!</p><p>It can simply be: &ldquo;She grabbed her bag and ran out the door.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He thought about roses and violets and a song started to play.</p><p>In this case, the double &ldquo;and&rdquo; adds confusion. At first read, you&rsquo;d assume he was thinking about three things: roses, violets, and a song. Only once you finish the sentence do you realize that the song is part of a <em>new</em> sentence.</p><p>A comma can fix this: &ldquo;He thought about roses and violets, and a song started to play.&rdquo;</p><p>But in this case, I&rsquo;d rewrite to lose the double &ldquo;and&rdquo;: &ldquo;He thought about roses and violets. A song started to play.&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=quotation-marks>Quotation Marks</h2><p>Reserve these (<code>"</code>) for <a href=../dialogue/>Dialogue</a> or actual quotes.</p><p>Not much else to say about them.</p><ul><li>Make sure you use opening quotes at the start and closing quotes at the end.</li><li>Make sure they match: don&rsquo;t start dialogue with a single quote (<code>'</code>) and end with a double quote (<code>"</code>).</li></ul><h2 id=colon>Colon</h2><p>A colon (<code>:</code>) announces a word, phrase or clause to come.</p><p>It is <strong>explanatory</strong>. The first part of the sentence introduces something. The second part (after the colon) expands on it further.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The wise man told me three things: to eat well, exercise and be happy.</p></div><p>It introduces &ldquo;three things&rdquo;, and after the colon it explains that.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Nobody dared enter the forest alone: a magic spider would kill you before you could blink.</p></div><p>It introduces the notion that nobody dares enter the forest. Why? It explains after the colon.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Few people know the truth about magic. Even fewer can wield it.</p><p>These two sentences can&rsquo;t be connected with a colon. The second sentence doesn&rsquo;t explain some notion from the first one.</p></div><p>Colons are uncommon in longer sentences.</p><p>Firstly, because you can&rsquo;t put anything <em>after</em> the explanation. (Adding another colon or short sentence would be very confusing.)</p><p>Secondly, because then you&rsquo;d just replace the colon with a period. Prose has the implicit contract with the reader that anything that&rsquo;s unclear now will be explained later. Anything you introduce now will get more explanation later. As such, the colon is often not <em>necessary</em>. Just start a new sentence with the explanation.</p><h2 id=semicolon>Semicolon</h2><p>The semicolon is compromise between the comma and the colon.</p><p>Its advantage? It can be used multiple times in a sentence (if you really want) and interrupts the text flow less.</p><p>Its disadvantage? It can only create a specific connection: two <strong>independent clauses</strong>. This means the clauses are <em>related</em>, but could be a sentence on their own.</p><p>As such, the semicolon can <em>always</em> be replaced by a period. Sometimes, it can be replaced by a comma or colon, if the conditions are right.</p><p>Why use it then? For variation and style points. To bring two sentences closer together than a period allows, or to prevent the repetitive structure of a sequence of really short sentences.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The world isn&rsquo;t ending. It already did. => The world isn&rsquo;t ending; it already did.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He never learned the true meaning of love. She never forgot the true meaning of friendship. => He never learned the true meaning of love; she never forgot the true meaning of friendship.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The car wasn&rsquo;t built for dirt roads. The sky was blue like her eyes.</p><p>These sentences aren&rsquo;t related, so no semicolon allowed.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The witch was angry, so angry.</p><p>The second sentence can&rsquo;t stand on its own, so no semicolon allowed.</p></div><h2 id=parentheses-brackets--braces>Parentheses, Brackets & Braces</h2><p>These three symbols (<code>()</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>{}</code>) are mostly for <em>programming</em> and <em>science</em>. In general, they shouldn&rsquo;t appear in prose.</p><p>Reading this course, you might notice that I <em>sometimes</em> use parentheses. It&rsquo;s my style and I think it can be valuable in non-fiction. In my fiction, though? Not a single one.</p><p>Parentheses communicate that something is of lesser importance or optional. It&rsquo;s usually used for a small comment or remark.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He was a (quite unsuccessful) lawyer.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>She was handsome. (And he tried to be.)</p></div><p>Even so, you must ask yourself the simple question: &ldquo;If this detail is not important or optional &mldr; then why add it at all?&rdquo;</p><p>If you find yourself placing things between parentheses, you can probably just cut those details entirely when you do the revision. If the text does have some value, just put it there without parentheses!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve rarely read a book that employs them, and if they do, it stands out as odd and takes me out of the book.</p><p>Why? Because parentheses are a <em>vertical</em> line, while language flows <em>horizontally</em>. It&rsquo;s a huge interruption. The reader bumps into a wall and has to change their mind-set to: &ldquo;Oh, this belongs to the sentence, but isn&rsquo;t really important.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=dashes--hyphens>Dashes & Hyphens</h2><p>These look similar, but are surely different.</p><p><strong>Hyphens</strong> (<code>-</code>) are used for compound words, such as &ldquo;mind-set&rdquo; or &ldquo;well-written&rdquo;. In a book with justified text, they&rsquo;re also used to signal a word is broken off and will continue on the next line.</p><p><strong>Dashes</strong> (<code>---</code>) are longer and serve a purpose. They are similar to a comma, but with a more punchy or aggressive impact. You can use them to add sub clauses, comments or elaborations to another sentence.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He decided not to do it&mdash;he was after all only a child.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The man looked heartbroken&mdash;to me, anyways&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for him.</p></div><p>I heavily prefer sticking the words directly against the dash. Some people leave a <em>space</em> around it, which is fine, but takes up more room while being harder to read.</p><h2 id=ampersands>Ampersands</h2><p>An ampersand (<code>&</code>) should never be used in regular prose. Reserve it for titles, headlines or names. (See the headings of this article.) The symbol was specifically designed for that purpose. It makes titles shorter <em>and</em> makes them stand out as such.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>He bought the book from <em>Barnes & Nobles</em>.</p></div><h2 id=ellipsis>Ellipsis</h2><p>Many beginning writers will connect parts of the story using multiple dots. I&rsquo;ve lost count of how many internet comments I&rsquo;ve read in which somebody connects all paragraphs with &ldquo;&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>This is simply wrong and unreadable.</p><p>Multiple dots <em>can</em> be used to signal somebody wandering off, leaving a thought unfinished, pausing or slowing down. If so, however, prefer converting it into an &ldquo;ellipsis&rdquo; (<code>...</code>). That&rsquo;s one specific symbol that looks like three dots. (Although this is more of a typography issue.)</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;I &mldr; I don&rsquo;t &mldr; I never meant to hurt anyone,&rdquo; she whispered.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-writing secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-writing secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/vocabulary/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Vocabulary</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/writing/creative-writing/prose/sentence-structure-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Sentence Structure I</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
