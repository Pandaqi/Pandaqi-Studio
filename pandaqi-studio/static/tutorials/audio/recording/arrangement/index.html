Your room is ready. Your song is ready &mldr; right? Not quite. When I started recording, I thought I entered my booth well-prepared. I&rsquo;d written lyrics and chords for the full song. Maybe I even <em>printed</em> that on paper, so I didn&rsquo;t have to remember or look at my phone!</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough. When you start recording, you suddenly realize there are a million more decisions to make. Just &ldquo;chords&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t enough.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the tempo? What&rsquo;s the strumming pattern? What&rsquo;s the instrumentation? How <em>long</em> is the intro actually going to be? Do we add a pause between verse and chorus or not?</p><p>I kept getting stuck on these questions. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for them. I realized my song &mldr; was actually only 10% of a song.</p><p>My personality is very improvisational. I hate planning or structure. But let me tell you, I <em>had</em> to learn how to arrange songs beforehand. Without it, recording became a mess from which I could never recover.</p><p>So what is that, arrangement?</p><h2 id=arrangement>Arrangement</h2><p>It simply means you decide on <em>all parts</em> of a song. Not just a single take. Not just one instrument. But all the recordings, which will combine to make the full song.</p><p>You <em>arrange</em> all the pieces you have into a final recording. This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;music mixing&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s more &ldquo;songwriting&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s close enough to recording that I needed to mention it here.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t do this beforehand, you&rsquo;re likely to waste time, or throw away 50% of what you do. Because you realize you wanted a different tempo. Because you invented two melodies, but never tested if they actually work together. Because you thought you were done, then realized a week later that you forgot to record that drum that&rsquo;s sorely needed.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>There&rsquo;s one song online, by me, which was recorded in the wrong tempo. It&rsquo;s one of the very first I ever recorded. I had an amazing take &mldr; and only realized later that I wanted a different tempo and key. Because I was naÃ¯ve, I thought &ldquo;meh, let&rsquo;s just transpose and edit it&rdquo;. It sounds <em>okay</em>, but anybody with a critical ear can tell it&rsquo;s been edited and sounds worse for it.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Similarly, I once spent a lot of time recording a complicated guitar piece in one go. A few days later, I hit my forehead and called myself the stupidest person alive. I could just &mldr; split the piece into multiple parts. Multiple layers, different recordings, which <em>combine</em> to sound similar. In fact, doing so made it sound much better.</p></div><p>Arrangement ensures you know <em>what</em> to record and <em>how</em>. All recordings for the same project will fit together and go smoothly, because you thought about it <em>beforehand</em> and decided exactly what parts you want.</p><p>Stating it like this, it hopefully becomes obvious. Good audio recording starts with being certain about <em>what</em> to record.</p><h2 id=how-to-do-it>How to do it?</h2><p>As mentioned, this is more <a href=../../songwriting/>Songwriting</a>. Check out that course, especially the Arrangement chapters at the end, for details. After that, this is more <a href=../../music-mixing/>Music Mixing</a>. Check out <em>that</em> course as well! ðŸ˜‰ Yes, writing and arranging compositions is a huge area which takes a lot of skill.</p><p>But if we just focus on the <em>recording</em> aspect, I can also give many useful tips.</p><h3 id=set-it-all-in-stone>Set it all in stone</h3><p>First of all, you should <em>have every part of the song</em>. The lyrics, the chords, the melody, the support, the timing, the time signature, etcetera.</p><p>Like, <em>really know it</em>. Not &ldquo;the melody goes something like this &mldr;&rdquo; or &ldquo;and then you do those few high notes, and then &mldr;&rdquo;. You know the <strong>pitches</strong> and the <strong>timing</strong> of them.</p><p>Why? Because if you don&rsquo;t, you <em>will</em> do something different every time. Which means all your takes are incompatible, which means you recorded the wrong thing. Something you can&rsquo;t fix with editing 99% of the time. The recording might sound amazing, but it&rsquo;s still the wrong thing, and thus of no value.</p><p>If needed, make your first few takes about this. Lay down the <em>exact</em> rhythm or melody. Test a few different tempos until you find your perfect fit. Only once you&rsquo;re <strong>sure</strong> about those details, start going into &ldquo;record a lot of takes of everything&rdquo; mode.</p><p><em>Won&rsquo;t that kill creativity? Inspiration?</em> No. This is <em>recording</em>, not <em>songwriting</em>. Use that creativity and inspiration while writing the song, while coming up with all those details. Recording is about getting that song idea as digital audio files. Recording <em>while</em> you&rsquo;re still writing the song means you&rsquo;re mixing two disciplines that have a clear order in which they should happen.</p><p>Sure, you can experiment. Play it as loose as you like. As I said, I like improvising (a lot)! That, however, means I create an arrangement beforehand, but <em>allow</em> myself to deviate it if needed. If all goes wrong, I still have that arrangement to fall back on.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no downside to this. You can throw your arrangement in the trash can if you have lots of inspiration or better ideas during the recording session. It&rsquo;s not holding you back. It&rsquo;s a valuable <em>tool</em> to prevent mistakes or wasted time during the recording process.</p><p>Once you do that, you&rsquo;ll realize the power of <strong>doubling</strong> and <strong>splitting</strong></p><h3 id=doubling>Doubling</h3><p>To get that <em>stereo</em> sound our ears like, you can record the same part multiple times. (One is panned to the left ear, one to the right ear.)</p><p>When played simultaneously, it will sound <em>wide</em> and <em>three dimensional</em>. Because our ears hear the same thing, but slightly different, which also happens in the real world! Our head merges the two sounds and views them as coming from the <em>same</em> source.</p><p>It&rsquo;s that simple. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; that every song on earth uses in spades. It&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s cheap and easy to execute.</p><p>All you need is <em>two takes</em> that are almost identical, but not quite. If it&rsquo;s a background instrument, you can get away with even more imperfection.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>When you play <em>too perfectly</em>, that&rsquo;s actually a problem. If the takes are practically identical, you lose this stereo effect&mdash;because our ears hear two sounds that are the SAME! You also get phase issues, which I&rsquo;ll cover soon.</p></div><p>This works on any instrument. The voice often has multiple doubles, especially in pop songs. Guitar chords absolutely <em>love</em> this, as long as the strumming rhythm is tight (otherwise it sounds like stuttering).</p><p>The lesson? Do multiple takes of everything. Most things will sound much better when doubled. Otherwise, you can just forget the other takes and play it as a mono source.</p><h3 id=splitting>Splitting</h3><p>This is a powerful technique that&rsquo;s barely mentioned. It&rsquo;s what I mentioned in the example above: I split a complex piece into multiple parts to record separately.</p><p>Why is this so powerful?</p><ul><li>It allows you to do <em>easier</em> performances. (Less mistakes, takes less energy, easier to edit.)</li><li>While the end result is often more beautiful and more flexible. (Splitting a melody might give new ideas or potential for recordings.)</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The melody I talk about had both very high and very low notes. That&rsquo;s why it was so hard to play: I had to stretch my fingers the full length of the guitar. So I split it into &ldquo;low guitar&rdquo; and &ldquo;high guitar&rdquo;. But now each piece was a bit boring on its own. So I added a bit of flourish to both recordings. Then, when I played them at the same time, I surprised myself by how much <em>better</em> it sounded.</p></div><p>Often, I play the main part of a song on my guitar using pretty standard chords. But then I&rsquo;ll record the same chords but <em>higher</em>, and a variation of the chords that emphasizes more of the <em>lower</em> strings. Combined, it sounds like you&rsquo;re playing one guitar&mdash;the most beautiful one in the world.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>When I just started, I&rsquo;d often send recordings to friends and family. Until I told them about the process, they always assumed it was <em>one guitar</em>, recorded really well. This is true for 99% of songs. You think you hear a few instruments and a voice, but it&rsquo;s actually an <em>arrangement</em> of multiple layers that brings out the best of the song.</p></div><p>The lesson? If something is too hard to play, or you&rsquo;re uncertain about the sound, split it. Usually by frequency (low, mid, high) or rhythm (slow, mid, fast). Easier recording, potential for surprising effects, more flexibility.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Arrange your songs.</p><ul><li>Think about <em>every part</em> and write down every detail. No vague melodies, lyrics, or instrumentation when entering the recording booth.</li><li>Determine your layers in advance. Which should be doubled? (Or quadrupled?) Which might be split?</li><li>If you want multiple instruments, make sure they are available <em>and</em> have their own parts.</li></ul><p>This will remove errors and wasted time from your recording process. It will also teach you a lot about songwriting. It will ask your brain to not only write a song, but also think about the steps further down the line: how it will translate to a microphone (and finally a finished mix).</p><p>As the saying goes,</p><blockquote><p>A well-written song will lead to easy recording and mixing. A bad arrangement can never be saved.</p></blockquote></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-ii-environment/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Space II: Environment</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/recording/monitoring/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Monitoring</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
