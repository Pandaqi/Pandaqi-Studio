I&rsquo;ll explain them in this chapter. If you&rsquo;re not ready to spend any (more) money, or not interested, feel free to skip it entirely.</p><h2 id=midi-keyboard>MIDI Keyboard</h2><p>Even though my first instrument was the guitar, and it remains my first love, I always tell people to get a keyboard and learn that.</p><p>Why? It&rsquo;s easier and more versatile, <em>especially</em> when recording audio.</p><p>A MIDI keyboard can be plugged into your computer or audio interface. You can play it like a regular piano, but set its sound to <em>anything</em>. So you can play strings, violins, a trumpet, dance beats, whatever.</p><p>You can get an okay one for 100 euros. Once you have it, you can easily record ideas (or actual final tracks) anytime and anywhere.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This was my use case. I bought a tiny one for 70 euros once. I had a big one&mdash;which was passed down to me from my brother&mdash;but it was just too impractical. I struggled to find energy for recording because I had to move stuff around and get that huge ass piano on my desk. This is a recurring theme: go for practical and quick in your workflow, above all else.</p></div><p>Instruments like the <em>guitar</em> can <strong>not</strong> be replaced with a MIDI keyboard. You&rsquo;ll miss everything that makes the guitar sound: strumming, pick against the strings, sliding (and other guitar-specific techniques).</p><p>The same is somewhat true for <strong>drums</strong>. Yes, you can emulate them by hammering keys on a keyboard. It will most likely feel wrong, if you even manage to keep to a rhythm.</p><h2 id=multiple-microphones>Multiple microphones</h2><p>For a while, I recorded everything with a single microphone. This was fine. But there are situations where you need 2 (or even more) microphones.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I do a lot of subtle guitar work. As explained before, you can&rsquo;t just record it twice, because the takes won&rsquo;t match at all. So I needed two microphones, pointed at the guitar from different locations. Together, they record <em>one</em> performance in <em>stereo</em>.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I realized my vocal performance was bad (and just didn&rsquo;t feel good) when I didn&rsquo;t support myself. I was used to playing an instrument and singing over it, not doing these things individually. After months of doubt, I decided to buy a third mic. Two on the guitar, one on my voice. Now I could just give a live performance! But I had enough individual tracks to make it sound good later.</p></div><h2 id=microphone-stands>Microphone stands</h2><p>This is self-explanatory. Some microphones can stand by themselves. Most will <em>require</em> a microphone stand.</p><p>Why do I not deem this essential, then? Because you can get away without one. For some time, I had more microphones than stands. (Long story.) I simply placed microphones on boxes or tables, or once even in my lap, and it was fine.</p><p>Yes, buy some solid stands, with lots of height and reach. (Extendible arms everywhere!) Don&rsquo;t go for the cheapest option. It can barely reach anything, the knobs will break, and it&rsquo;s too lightweight to support a proper microphone. Go for the 40-50 euro options.</p><p>It&rsquo;s very practical and will allow you to place microphones <em>anywhere you want</em>, easily. A solid recommendation. But not &ldquo;essential&rdquo; to me.</p><h2 id=some-type-of-controller>Some type of controller</h2><p>My biggest annoyance when recording was my lack of controller. Whenever I wanted to start/stop a take, I had to either reach for my keyboard (far away) or click some tiny button with my mouse.</p><p>To make space for my microphones&mdash;and prevent any fan noise from my computer&mdash;I had to place the laptop far away. But this made it tough to interact with it. My frustration (and back pain) grew with every take.</p><p>So I recommend getting yourself some kind of (remote) controller. Just a small device, or <em>some</em> system, that allows you to start/stop/redo takes easily from anywhere.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I ended up using my MIDI keyboard for this. It had some knobs and dials, which I programmed to start/stop. The keyboard doesn&rsquo;t make any noise and is small. So it just sits next to me while recording.</p></div><h2 id=pre-amplifier>Pre-amplifier</h2><p>Last chapter, I mentioned you should focus on <strong>preamps</strong> when buying an audio interface. Of course, these tools can also be bought separately. They are just a tiny object you can put somewhere in your chain before conversion to digital&mdash;usually your microphone or cable.</p><p>They allow raising the volume of any recording <em>a lot</em>, without adding any noise.</p><p>I bought one, because a microphone of mine had output that was <em>just</em> too low. Was it useful? Yes. You get more clarity and less noise. Was it an essential purchase? Absolutely not. Now I know ways how I could&rsquo;ve fixed the problem without buying that preamp.</p><h2 id=speakers>Speakers</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a fun fact. The sound from my laptop <em>changes considerably</em> when listening from a different angle.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not great when you try to produce music. How can you hear what your recording sounds like? What is the &ldquo;true&rdquo; sound? How can you ever know?</p><p>For that reason, it helps to buy a good set of speakers. These plug into your audio interface, usually two big outputs at the back. They&rsquo;ll reproduce the sound as natural and unbiased as possible.</p><p>Due to how speakers (and the physics of sound) work,</p><blockquote><p>A bigger speaker will always produce a better sound quality</p></blockquote><p>But again, no need to go overboard. Just a simple set of solid speakers is fine. This helps <em>monitor</em> your recordings afterwards. Without any bias or doubt about what it actually sounds like.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>That said, &ldquo;bad&rdquo; equipment is still a good test. Because you also want your recordings to sound good on <em>those</em>. Most people don&rsquo;t have dedicated speakers. They&rsquo;re listening on their crappy phone.</p></div><h2 id=advanced-acoustic-treatment>Advanced acoustic treatment</h2><p>Better acoustic treatment is <em>always</em> useful.</p><p>On a low budget? There are relatively cheap packs to buy. These have foam patterns in different sizes.</p><p>But I don&rsquo;t recommend this. These are <em>fixed</em> and only <em>barely</em> work. I recommend getting a setup you can easily move around with much <em>thicker</em> elements. (You need more and more thickness to stop lower pitched sounds.)</p><p>If you go for this, reserve a slightly higher budget.</p><p>I&rsquo;d recommend <strong>acoustic panels</strong>. These can be carried, moved around, hung on your wall, maybe even put on wheels. They are thick and <em>work</em>, but they&rsquo;re also often pretty to look at. I&rsquo;d recommend something like <a href=https://www.ekustik.eu/catalog/absorber-woody-queen>Ekustik</a></p><p>If you have even more budget, I&rsquo;d recommend just treating an entire room and dedicating it to being &ldquo;the studio space&rdquo;. Buy panels, buy rugs, buy bass traps for in the corners, buy wooden diffusers. In fact, if you&rsquo;re this serious, there&rsquo;s probably a company you can enlist to do this all for you. They&rsquo;ll measure the room, find the ideal spots for the ideal treatment, and put everything in service of &ldquo;killing that nasty reverb&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=vocal-tools>Vocal tools</h2><p>The main one is the <strong>pop filter</strong>. These usually come by default with a starter microphone. They guard against those &ldquo;plosives&rdquo; I mentioned in <a href=../the-disconnect/>The Disconnect</a>. I highly recommend using <em>some</em> pop filter when recording vocals.</p><p><em>Why is this not essential then?</em> Because you can find ways around it. You can learn to sing while controlling those plosives. You can point the mic at your mouth from more of an <em>angle</em>. Some people hold a pencil in front of their mouth to &ldquo;split&rdquo; the plosives.</p><p>There are numerous ways to reduce this issue&mdash;<em>if</em> it occurs for you&mdash;without buying this equipment.</p><p>The same is true for <strong>reflection screens</strong>. These are usually attached to the microphone stand and wrap around the microphone. These are mostly <em>useless</em>: only their sides, if they wrap around far enough, do some real damage. Next chapter talks about acoustics. It will explain <em>why</em> those screens don&rsquo;t do much for you. (It&rsquo;s because they guard the mic from the back, which is the part it doesn&rsquo;t hear anyway.)</p><h2 id=small-tools>Small tools</h2><p>These are cheap, but you still have to know they exist (and buy them).</p><ul><li>Many picks in many different sizes (for guitar) => which one you use actually changes the sound and performance</li><li>A capo (for guitar) => to easily transpose pieces</li><li>An actual MIDI cable => you&rsquo;ll need this to put a MIDI device in an audio interface, as they usually only ship with a USB cable</li><li>Extension cords for different cables => recording, headphone, USB, any of them (in case you need more room)</li><li>A tuner => yes, you can use an app on your phone. A dedicated tuner will be more accurate and faster to use. Besides, you don&rsquo;t want your phone with you when recording, because if there&rsquo;s something that will distract or make noise &mldr;</li><li>Very useful plugins or VSTs (Virtual Instruments) to use in your software => they&rsquo;ll come preinstalled, or you can find free ones online.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m probably forgetting many tiny details. You&rsquo;ll pick them up as you get more experience with recording. As you understand more of the <em>practical</em> side and what tiny changes would improve your workflow.</p><p>Pfew, now let&rsquo;s record&mdash;oh no, we still have to do more preparation. But it&rsquo;s all for the best. You don&rsquo;t want to do like I did: record for weeks, then throw them away once you learn what <em>actual good acoustics are</em>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, next chapter will talk about that.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/recording/equipment-i-essentials/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Equipment I: Essentials</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-i-acoustics/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Space I: Acoustics</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
