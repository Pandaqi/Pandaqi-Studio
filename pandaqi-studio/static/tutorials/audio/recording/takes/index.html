Your microphones are all in place and you&rsquo;re warmed up. Now it&rsquo;s time to do individual recordings&mdash;individual takes. It&rsquo;s finally time to do the actual recording! Get those sounds as digital files!</p><p>As expected, there are still more tips and tricks to consider. But there&rsquo;s one principle that stands out above all.</p><blockquote><p>Do many takes, many versions, many tries. Don&rsquo;t worry about getting it perfect in one go.</p></blockquote><p>Like many artists, I&rsquo;m a perfectionist. I want to do everything <em>right</em> the first time. But that&rsquo;s simply impossible. We&rsquo;re imperfect beings, making music and recording is <em>hard</em>, so it will often go wrong. Or you just don&rsquo;t <em>know</em> what &ldquo;right&rdquo; is until you&rsquo;ve tried it.</p><p>Nevertheless, even knowing this doesn&rsquo;t stop me from procrastinating and doubting myself. Which leads to doing nothing&mdash;which surely can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;right&rdquo;!</p><p>The only way to stop this, is by realizing you have infinite takes. You could record a phrase of your song a hundred times, and all those takes could sound <em>terrible</em>, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter! You only need one take&mdash;or several takes you can combine&mdash;that works for you.</p><p>Some people have the opposite problem. They do a thousand takes for <em>everything</em>, which slows them down and gives them so many options they don&rsquo;t know what to choose. That&rsquo;s perhaps even worse.</p><p>Find a balance here. Do a multitude of takes. But if your numbers are reaching ridiculous heights, take a break, or just be happy with what you have. Pick the best recording you already have. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a decent one among the fifty takes.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Don&rsquo;t forget <a href=../gain-staging/>Gain staging</a>! I already explained this, so won&rsquo;t do it again here, to keep things short and quick.</p></div><h2 id=transitions>Transitions</h2><p>By far the biggest <em>issue</em> with my first recordings, was the lack of <em>transition</em>. I&rsquo;d start the recording immediately, at the start of the first measure. When I had done my part (singing or playing guitar), I&rsquo;d immediately slam the spacebar to stop recording.</p><p>The result? You get a take that has no smooth start or finish. Which makes it near impossible to fit in with other takes, because there&rsquo;s no <em>transition</em> possible between them.</p><p>Additionally, this made the start of each take inconsistent. Because I started <em>immediately</em> (after hitting record), I was still searching the right pitch and rhythm in that first second.</p><p>Fixing this issue made my (recording) life much easier. And led to better, usable recordings 99% of the time.</p><p>How to fix? Simply <strong>leave room before and after the recording</strong>. Move the cursor one or two measures <em>before</em> the part you actually want to record. Once done, wait a few seconds, and <em>then</em> stop it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s even better if you can <strong>follow along</strong>. Don&rsquo;t just wait in silence until your part starts. Play or sing along with the backing track, pretend you&rsquo;re doing the whole song. This means you automatically record that &ldquo;transition&rdquo; between parts! Because you&rsquo;re actually <em>doing</em> it!</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than a great take &mldr; that just won&rsquo;t fit anywhere, because the start and end are scuffed. This is, again, something that <em>can</em> be fixed with editing. But it&rsquo;d take hours and the end result would still be worse than just recording it again, but with space.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>How do you actually do that transition? Most DAWs allow you to overlap the start/end of two takes and then apply a <strong>cross fade</strong>. This fade can be <em>very</em> short. But you&rsquo;ll hear a click or pop if it&rsquo;s not there. If the two takes have the right tempo and pitch, they&rsquo;ll transition nicely.</p></div><h2 id=start-off-strong>Start off strong</h2><p>To prevent this &ldquo;uncertain start&rdquo;, it helps to <strong>match rhythm and pitch</strong> before every take. During those 1-2 measures before the actual part, already match the tempo and key of the song. Make random noises, or strum the guitar, to match the song as perfectly as possible.</p><p>If this is hard, actually <em>play</em> the right first note for yourself.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve recorded vocals for many songs while holding my guitar. I wasn&rsquo;t <em>playing</em> the guitar while singing. I used it to find the right pitch before the recording started. (I&rsquo;d just pluck the first note I had to sing on my guitar, and matched it with my voice. Then, a few seconds later, I sang the actual part.)</p><p>The same is true for rhythm. Make sure you can clearly hear the metronome. Perhaps tap along <em>before</em> the recording starts. Anything to get you in the groove of the song, so your recording starts off strong a second later.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to give a great performance &ldquo;out of thin air&rdquo;. Instead, give longer performances, and use <em>parts</em> of them.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This also helps to keep you warmed up. Instead of waiting between takes, you keep singing or jamming along with an existing recording for a few measures.</p></div><h2 id=tuning>Tuning</h2><p>Some people say you should tune between <em>every</em> take. I think that&rsquo;s a bit extreme. It would undermine all your productivity, as 50% of your time would be spent just tuning again and again. In my experience, this isn&rsquo;t worth it&mdash;unless you do <em>really long takes</em> of course.</p><p>Instead, I tune between sections. When I switch to a new instrument or section of the song, I tune again.</p><p>You can tune in many ways:</p><ul><li>A tuner app on your phone</li><li>An actual tuner device</li><li>Using a standard Tuner plugin in your DAW</li></ul><p>That third option is missed by many. Your mic is already connected to your DAW! It&rsquo;s already recording! So put a plugin on that track, and you can see the pitch of anything it records.</p><p>This means you can leave the phone out of the studio. It also means you can both tune instruments <em>and</em> your voice (by checking if the pitches you sing are actually the correct ones).</p><h2 id=finish-what-you-started>Finish what you started</h2><p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see others record themselves. I&rsquo;ve had some people record in my improvised studio. (Family and friends, I wouldn&rsquo;t dare bring anyone else to my run-down attic :p)</p><p>Almost all of them will quit a recording within <em>milliseconds</em> of starting it. They&rsquo;ll sing the first note and immediately be like: &ldquo;Ah no that&rsquo;s not it! Stop!&rdquo;</p><p>Don&rsquo;t do this.</p><p>Why? It means you&rsquo;re being extremely self-conscious about your performance &mldr; while doing it. You&rsquo;re not in any flow, you&rsquo;re not focused on just <em>performing</em>&mdash;you&rsquo;re focused on getting a perfect recording. Which, as we know by now, leads to bad recordings. (Or none at all, if you stop everything within a second.)</p><p>Even if you start bad, finish the part you wanted to record. Even if you miss a note, continue and finish. Don&rsquo;t worry about that.</p><p>You can throw away the whole take later. You can do another take. Most likely, much of that take is actually quite usable later, and you&rsquo;ll be glad you finished.</p><h2 id=clicks-and-pops>Clicks and pops</h2><p>In the <a href=../microphones/>Microphones</a> chapter, I mentioned the &ldquo;low-end rumble&rdquo; that&rsquo;s produced by many things in our life. Most microphones have a &ldquo;high pass filter&rdquo; ( = only the <em>high</em> frequencies pass through) to combat most of this issue before it even reaches your computer. If you hear rumble, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d look first.</p><p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re causing it yourself. The same is true for pops, clicks, ticks, <em>any</em> annoying (quick) sounds that get into recordings.</p><p>The culprit &mldr; is you! :p</p><p>Many people, in their impatience or nervousness, will play with things. They&rsquo;ll grab the mic stand while singing. They&rsquo;ll play with their buttons while waiting a few bars (before the next take starts). They&rsquo;ll tap the floor, something that is <em>on</em> the floor, their instrument, a cable, <em>whatever</em>.</p><p>We like doing stuff and making all sorts of tiny noises. But when recorded? These noises are NOT tiny. Because of microphone sensitivity, anything close enough <em>will</em> be captured and it <em>will</em> sound much louder and destroy the recording.</p><p>The lesson here is simple:</p><blockquote><p>Stop playing with objects and subconsciously creating noises. At least while that recording is active.</p></blockquote><p>Otherwise, a pop or click in your recording could have a number of reasons.</p><ul><li>Your interface/computer can&rsquo;t keep up. So it freezes for a bit, causing a <em>gap</em> in the recording. Even tiny ones register as a nasty click to our ears.</li><li>Your cables or microphones are faulty. (Though unlikely. If they are broken, the effects are usually much more severe and immediate. You&rsquo;ll <em>know</em> for sure when something broke.)</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>As expected, I did this. I thought I was very silent and contained. And, relative to other people, I was. But when a microphone is right next to you? It reveals just how much you&rsquo;re moving around, pulling at your clothes, tapping against things, breathing out <em>very loudly</em>. It will take some time to unlearn these subconscious bad habits.</p></div><h2 id=after-each-take>After each take</h2><p>Just like the person who does <em>too many takes</em>, you can do <em>too little</em> analysis of your work.</p><p>With my first recordings, I&rsquo;d just chug along for an hour or so. I&rsquo;d record everything I need, without listening back, at breakneck speed, until I was done. Microphones placed the same, settings the same, let&rsquo;s rock &rsquo;n roll!</p><p>Don&rsquo;t do this.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll only realize you sounded bad, or that you needed to do something <em>else</em>, once you&rsquo;ve already wasted your time and energy.</p><p><em>Do</em> listen to your takes. Be critical of them. If it&rsquo;s not right, change something, try something else. Hopefully, you still have that pen and paper on hand. Quickly write down some possible improvements.</p><ul><li>This note should be hit more clearly</li><li>This note could be sung with more energy</li><li>The general volume is too low compared to my recordings yesterday</li><li>I don&rsquo;t like how it starts, try a different strumming pattern</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul><p>The point is to do this <em>after</em> you already finished the whole take. Do this between takes, to know what to record next.</p><p>While performing, you <em>perform</em>. If you&rsquo;re recording someone else, tell them this advice. While performing, they just <em>perform</em> and nothing else.</p><p>Most major producers say something like:</p><blockquote><p>If you need more than 10 takes for a vocal, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong</p></blockquote><p>By itself, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s useful advice. They often forget to explain that they do this <em>critical analysis</em> after every take. To evaluate what actually needs to be (re)recorded. And use that feedback to make every take better and better.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I know this by watching videos where they work with a client or show how they work in general. All major producers do this. They don&rsquo;t go into a session or take with a blind set of principles, work for three hours, then hope one of the fifty takes was fine. Do a few takes, evaluate, do a few more <em>focused</em> takes.</p></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve told you all the major steps, principles and tips for recording audio. This should be more than enough to circumvent 99% of issues and capture <em>great performances</em> in a <em>great way</em>!</p><p>The last chapters of this course merely dive deeper into the three major instruments: guitar, piano and drum. They give specific tips, remarks, microphone placement, and more for each.
