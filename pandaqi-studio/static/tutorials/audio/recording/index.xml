It&amp;rsquo;s a completely different array of sounds and rhythms than piano.</description></item><item><title>Drums</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/recording/drums/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/recording/drums/</guid><description>Drums are the third instrument I suggest you learn (well).
