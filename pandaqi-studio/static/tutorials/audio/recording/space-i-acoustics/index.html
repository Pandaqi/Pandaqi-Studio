This chapter will explain the practical side of it. What to place? Where? And why?</p><p>We&rsquo;ll do this using <strong>points of interest</strong>! I&rsquo;ve ranked the different areas in a room based on how important they are. Based on how much they influence reverb and the final sound of a recording.</p><p>Remember, when you make a sound it will go in <em>all directions</em>. No matter where your guitar is facing, its sound will enter the room like an explosion in all directions. A microphone, on the other hand, only records in a targeted area.</p><h2 id=1-behind-the-source>1. Behind the source</h2><p>The microphone points at its source. It&rsquo;s most sensitive in that direction.</p><p>That means it will pick up anything <em>behind</em> the source. If you&rsquo;re singing and there&rsquo;s a wall behind you, that will cause the loudest reflections! Because the mic is looking right at it!</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Of course, in this case your body is blocking some of that. But usually not enough.</p></div><p>So soften the space behind you. I placed a spare mattress vertically against the wall behind me. You can hang blankets. If that&rsquo;s not possible, fill that space with a book shelf, or planets, or a myriad of other objects to <em>diffuse</em> the sound.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visual of how sound travels behind the source; why you should dampen it.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=acoustics_1_behind_source.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visual of how sound travels behind the source; why you should dampen it." title="Visual of how sound travels behind the source; why you should dampen it." width=855 height=439></picture></figure></p><h2 id=2-floor--ceiling>2. Floor & Ceiling</h2><p>Usually, a microphone is quite close to the floor. That&rsquo;s where the second loudest reflections come from. Fortunately, that&rsquo;s the easiest to solve! Place down a rug or carpet. Boom, you&rsquo;re done. It will even make the room nicer.</p><p>The ceiling is the second culprit. One that&rsquo;s much harder to treat. You&rsquo;ll probably want to <em>attach</em> something soft to the ceiling.</p><p>This is why recording studios have <em>very high ceilings</em>. (Churches and cathedrals have them as well, which is why they sound so pretty.) That circumvents the whole problem.</p><p>So, if possible, record in a room with a high ceiling. A <em>slanted</em> ceiling is the second-best thing, as it diffuses the sound. Otherwise, place your microphones lower to the ground on purpose.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visual of how sound travels to floor and ceiling; why you should dampen it.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=acoustics_2_floor_ceiling.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visual of how sound travels to floor and ceiling; why you should dampen it." title="Visual of how sound travels to floor and ceiling; why you should dampen it." width=855 height=440></picture></figure></p><h2 id=3-side-walls>3. Side walls</h2><p>A microphone usually isn&rsquo;t pointed <em>perfectly parallel</em> to the side walls. It&rsquo;s at an angle, seeing more of one wall than another. That wall will influence sound quite a bad. The other won&rsquo;t: it&rsquo;s more near the back of the mic, which is an area it won&rsquo;t pick up on.</p><p>Fortunately, this is also easy to treat. It&rsquo;s quite easy to hang something on the wall. Again, go for blankets, put a mattress upright, place a diverse array of objects (plush toys, books, plants) on a shelf or desk pushed against the wall.</p><p>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t pick perfectly flat and reflective objects. For example, paintings or photo frames are very reflective. If your wall/desk is filled with them, you&rsquo;re making the problem worse instead of better.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visual of how sound travels to the side walls; why you should dampen it.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=acoustics_3_side_wall.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visual of how sound travels to the side walls; why you should dampen it." title="Visual of how sound travels to the side walls; why you should dampen it." width=855 height=439></picture></figure></p><h2 id=4-behind-the-mic>4. Behind the mic</h2><p>Not important. If you create a &ldquo;recording booth&rdquo;, this is the side that you leave open (for entering and exiting). This is where the door is. Mics barely pick up sound from behind.</p><p>You can test this. Make a sound at a consistent volume into your mic, then turn it 360 degrees (slowly). You&rsquo;ll hear the sound disappearing at the back.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visual of how sound travels behind the mic (in front of the source); why it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=acoustics_4_behind_mic.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visual of how sound travels behind the mic (in front of the source); why it doesn&rsquo;t matter." title="Visual of how sound travels behind the mic (in front of the source); why it doesn&rsquo;t matter." width=855 height=439></picture></figure></p><h2 id=why-bedrooms-are-especially-awful>Why bedrooms are especially awful</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned how a flat ceiling is worse than a slanted one. How reflective objects, like photo frames, are bad. This is because they reflect the sound back perfectly straight. That means it&rsquo;s as <em>loud</em> and <em>fast</em> as can be. (Diffused sounds have bounced around the room more, becoming softer <em>and</em> arriving later at the mic.)</p><p>That&rsquo;s also why bedrooms are especially awful. They are usually shaped like a perfect square or rectangle. Which means all walls create this &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; reflection that leads to the worst interference. These are called <strong>standing waves</strong>, because they just stay where they are without diffusing or going anywhere.</p><p>If possible, pick a room that&rsquo;s not so perfectly shaped. Otherwise, <em>design</em> the interior of the room to break up any symmetry or patterns. With audio, randomness and diffusion is what we like.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visual of why perfect rooms are bad. How slanted surfaces can already do a lot.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=acoustics_5_perfect_room.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visual of why perfect rooms are bad. How slanted surfaces can already do a lot." title="Visual of why perfect rooms are bad. How slanted surfaces can already do a lot." width=855 height=440></picture></figure></p><h2 id=hear-it-in-practice>Hear it in practice</h2><p>First, I&rsquo;ll give you a picture of my own &ldquo;improvised&rdquo; recording booth.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>My improvised recording booth. Mattress at the back, thick blankets on either side, but the space behind mics is completely open.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=improvised_recording_booth_pandaqi.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="My improvised recording booth. Mattress at the back, thick blankets on either side, but the space behind mics is completely open." title="My improvised recording booth. Mattress at the back, thick blankets on either side, but the space behind mics is completely open." width=1753 height=1315></picture></figure></p><p>This was free to build. It took a few hours to arrange the boxes, find the space, <em>secure</em> everything (so the top doesn&rsquo;t fall on my head at any time).</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s hear the difference. The first recording was a demo (with improvised lyrics) I recorded spontaneously, using my phone or laptop mic.</p><figure class=no-hover><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-i-acoustics/hey_miss_laptop_recording.ogg type=audio/ogg></audio></figure><p>Then I got my good microphone. The guitar and voice now sound <em>much</em> better. (It&rsquo;s exactly the same guitar, and voice, of course.)</p><figure class=no-hover><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-i-acoustics/hey_miss_bad_reverb_good_mic.ogg type=audio/ogg></audio></figure><figure class=no-hover><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-i-acoustics/hey_miss_vocal_reverb.ogg type=audio/ogg></audio></figure><p>Notice how the recordings are very <em>washed out</em>. They sound fine, especially on their own, but there&rsquo;s a <em>ton</em> of reverb and noise on them. Once you start adding multiple tracks, this problem amplifies into something unsurmountable.</p><p>This is what a good microphone but <em>no acoustic treatment</em> gets you.</p><p>Now listen to this recording after I built that booth. (Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a different song. I could find no takes from a single song across such a large time span.) It&rsquo;s one take, with one mic, using a soft Spanish guitar that&rsquo;s notoriously hard to record.</p><figure class=no-hover><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-i-acoustics/as_the_banjo_plays_take_6.ogg type=audio/ogg></audio></figure><p>Hopefully, you hear how clean and smooth it sounds. There&rsquo;s no noise. No echo interfering with the vocals, breaking it down. It sounds <em>natural</em>. And the only difference is that booth. Otherwise, these things were recorded with the same instruments and at the same location. (The microphone wasn&rsquo;t even positioned with much care. As long as it was still inside the booth, I knew it would be fine.)</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>These sound files are not edited and also heavily compressed (to reduce strain on my website).</p></div><h2 id=more-extreme-quotes>More extreme quotes</h2><p>Again, people like talking in extremes. Many sound engineers will say something like &mldr;</p><blockquote><p>No! Acoustic treatment with blankets / household items never works! At all! You need to reserve at least a few thousand euros to professionally treat a whole room!</p></blockquote><p>Such advice just isn&rsquo;t useful &mldr; ever. Everything depends. People are different. Situations are different.</p><p>Saying something is always wrong or right just closes the door on 99% of the people. It shuts down innovation, experimentation, and &mldr; alternative routes for scrappy people without any budget (like me).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tested it. I&rsquo;ve tested loads of setups and items. This <em>works</em>. You <em>will</em> be able to find a setup, a combination of audio absorption and diffusion, that makes your room sound acceptable. Just keep trying.</p><p>Extreme advice (such as the above) stops people from <em>doing</em> something. And, in my view, <em>doing</em> always beats <em>not doing</em>&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s effort.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/recording/equipment-ii-useful/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Equipment II: Useful</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/recording/space-ii-environment/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Space II: Environment</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
