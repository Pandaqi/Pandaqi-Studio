This should be 99% of your journey to a great singing or speaking voice. With this relaxation and proper technique, good <em>timbre</em> will come.</p><p>Timbre simply means the <em>tone</em> or <em>general sound</em> of your voice. Many people can sing the same pitch, yet sound completely different. (Just as musical instruments can play the same pitch, yet sound different.)</p><p>All the exercises I&rsquo;ve given before should have taught you <em>control</em>. This means I don&rsquo;t have much left to teach: simply play with your timbre and see what it sounds like. Settle on a sound you enjoy.</p><p>As always, however, I&rsquo;ve had a long journey with this topic as well and wanted to share some nuggets of wisdom.</p><h2 id=vibrato>Vibrato</h2><p>Vibrato happens <em>automatically</em> when you are completely relaxed.</p><p>When I was young, I imitated many pop and punk singers I liked. This meant I sang with absolutely no vibrato or embellishment. I just sang the pitch, straight-on, no change.</p><p>Then I learned those exercises for relaxation. Then I learned vocal exercises.</p><p>And without specifically <em>training</em> vibrato or <em>wanting</em> it &mldr; it appeared. I suddenly had this nice vibrato with every note.</p><p>Because what <em>is</em> vibrato? It&rsquo;s a state in which your voice is so relaxed that it doesn&rsquo;t force anything. It doesn&rsquo;t hold on to a single pitch at all costs. Which allows you to <em>wobble</em> around the pitch, dipping in and out, <em>without</em> ever going off-pitch. Because you still have that control and that training.</p><p>This also means you can turn it off. In fact, after years of vocal exercises, I could hardly sing anything <em>without</em> vibrato!</p><p>What does this mean?</p><ul><li>If you&rsquo;ve started to develop a vibrato (because of these exercises), great! You&rsquo;re on the right path!</li><li>If you don&rsquo;t want that, practice turning it on and off. Sing a note with vibrato first. Then try to sing it <em>without</em> ever changing the pitch.</li></ul><p>It can help to imagine the note as a straight line, or to sing &ldquo;forward&rdquo; again.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>My story is a bit more complicated. The other reason I had vibrato over everything, is simply because my vocal folds weren&rsquo;t <em>strong</em> enough. I had to train for months&mdash;forcing myself to sing notes as a straight unwavering line&mdash;before I could control it and do it.</p><p>Now I can turn specific vocal styles on or off. Although vibrato remains my favorite and, seemingly, most &ldquo;natural&rdquo; voice. I remain a theater kid after all. While others hum the latest pop song, I would sing something from Les Miserables :p</p></div><h2 id=tone>Tone</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve used some semi-vague words to describe your tone throughout this guide: &ldquo;dark&rdquo;, &ldquo;muddled&rdquo;, &ldquo;dull&rdquo;, &ldquo;nasal&rdquo;.</p><p>Let me clarify that further here.</p><p>Tone is determined by <em>overtones</em>. Every pitch generates extra higher pitches, but they get softer and softer (as you get higher). That way, they shape the <em>sound</em>, but never overpower the base pitch. This is simply a natural property of our physical world.</p><ul><li>A dark sound is made by placing the sound lower. Lower your larynx more, lower your jaw more, don&rsquo;t place the sound full forward. This helps add mystery, gravitas or sexiness.</li><li>A dull or muddled sound usually comes from holding it in. You don&rsquo;t open your mouth enough. You lock your breathing and your tongue. This is solved by &ldquo;letting it out&rdquo;</li><li>A nasal sound, as expected, comes from singing through the nose.</li></ul><p>This is, again, something you can <em>check</em>! You can download apps or plugins that show you <em>frequencies</em> from a recording.</p><p>In general, the most healthy and pleasant sound is one that is <em>open</em> and <em>crisp</em>. This means your base frequency ( = the pitch you sang) is loudest, and then it tapers off from there. It produces an overtone every octave, but at less volume. Most importantly? It doesn&rsquo;t generate an enormous amount of frequencies elsewhere, and it has enough <em>(very) high frequencies</em> left.</p><ul><li>Without those high frequencies, a sound is &ldquo;thin&rdquo; or &ldquo;dull&rdquo;, like speaking through a can.</li><li>Conversely, if you have way too may high frequencies, the voice is &ldquo;nasal&rdquo; or &ldquo;harsh&rdquo;</li><li>With too many mid frequencies, a sound is &ldquo;muddled&rdquo;</li><li>With too many low frequencies, a sound is &ldquo;dark&rdquo;</li></ul><h2 id=nasal-vs-twang>Nasal vs Twang</h2><p>I might give the impression that a nasal sound is bad. It is not. Given the choice between nasal and throaty, pick nasal. It prevents damaging your voice, as all the sound and tension is in your <em>nose</em>.</p><p>A nasal sound can be pleasant and emotional to listen to. I think the singer from Mumford & Sons often sounds way better than a more &ldquo;typical&rdquo; singer could.</p><p>Perhaps even more important, it &ldquo;cuts through the mix&rdquo;. A nasal singer can often be clearly understood over all the other instruments, thanks to that high piercing timbre.</p><p>For this reason, many vocal coaches actually encourage <em>some</em> nasality in the form of <em>twang</em>. It&rsquo;s called like that &mldr; because it sounds like that.</p><p>Say the word &ldquo;TWANG!&rdquo; and the sound will be around your mask, a little nasal and a little like a crying baby.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the place and sound you must aim for, if you want maximum advantages and minimum disadvantages.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Interestingly, many people automatically mimic a singer when they cover their songs. I think this is natural and good. This helps you intuitively understand different timbres and different ways of producing the same pitch.</p><p>So don&rsquo;t turn this off. <em>Use</em> it. Listen to songs from many different artists, then try to sing their songs <em>their way</em>. Usually, that is also the best way. Musicians learn, over time, what sounds great for their voice and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>In the end, pick the timbre that is comfortable to you <em>and</em> matches your goals. Making your voice sound a certain way just because a vocal coach tells you to, or a YouTube video, isn&rsquo;t great.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>As I mentioned, I have a natural vibrato. I also naturally have a very high voice, that sounds slightly dark too. This is <em>ideal</em> for musical theatre. Those are my <em>ideal songs</em>. When I sing them, I feel like the best singer in the world.</p><p>And then I do a pop song, or folk rock, and I sound stupid. That vibrato, those sustained notes, it just doesn&rsquo;t work. So I switch to more of that &ldquo;Mumford & Sons&rdquo; vocal sound.</p><p>Over time, this taught me how to make any pitch in a variety of ways. And I think that&rsquo;s a useful skill for any musician to have.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/singing-and-speaking/pitch-and-scales/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Pitch & Scales</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/singing-and-speaking/vocal-health/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Vocal Damage</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
