We&rsquo;ve learned how to start our sounds properly, by <em>breathing</em> and being <em>relaxed</em> while doing it. The moment has come! We are about to make a sound with our mouth!</p><p>This is called &ldquo;vocal onset&rdquo;. The movement of the vocal folds coming together, stopping the air flow and turning it into <em>sound</em>.</p><p>This is one of those &ldquo;golden nuggets&rdquo;. Once I learned it, I improved massively. But, somehow, barely anyone teaches this.</p><ul><li>If you have a <em>good</em> onset, the rest of the note will follow with (relative) ease.</li><li>If you have a <em>bad</em> onset, the rest of the note will suffer.</li></ul><p>What is good? What is bad? Well, it all comes down to tension again. Many bring their vocal folds together too forcefully. This results in a chopped air flow, and usually a (soft) guttural sound (&ldquo;ggh&rdquo;) before every new phrase.</p><p>Others take too long to bring their vocal folds together, sounding &ldquo;breathy&rdquo; at the start of each note. (And losing confidence in their voice.)</p><p>A good onset means you &mldr;</p><ul><li>Immediately hit the right note</li><li>Without extra noises or tension</li><li>Which makes it sound <em>loud</em> and <em>clean</em></li></ul><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><p>Like with all exercises, now that you know the <em>term</em> (or what to look for), you can search for other tips or videos.</p><h3 id=the-confident-shout>The confident shout</h3><p>When we shout, usually in panic, we automatically have good onset. Because we <em>have</em> to be fast, loud and clear.</p><p>You can emulate this by, well, pretending that you&rsquo;re about to tell somebody off (who&rsquo;s being a pain in your ass). Loudly say &ldquo;hey!&rdquo; or &ldquo;ho!&rdquo; or &ldquo;wait!&rdquo; or &ldquo;ouch!&rdquo; or whatever.</p><p>The idea is that there is <em>no</em> build-up. No holding back. No overthinking this. A loud, immediate shout.</p><h3 id=the-kazoo-a-fun-one>The Kazoo (a fun one)</h3><p>First, buy a Kazoo. (They&rsquo;re quite cheap and in general a fun tiny instrument to have.)</p><p>Place your lips around the big opening, pushing the Kazoo against your teeth. Now make an &ldquo;ooeh&rdquo; sound through it. If you want, sing a melody (on that &ldquo;oeh&rdquo;, with the Kazoo).</p><p>This will reveal how good your vocal onset is:</p><ul><li>If your vocal folds close nicely, the tone will be <em>loud</em> and <em>pure</em></li><li>If less so, the tone will be <em>soft</em> and more <em>crunchy</em></li><li>If it&rsquo;s really bad (hoarse throat, terrible technique, &mldr;), there will be <em>no sound</em></li></ul><p>This is a good test. It&rsquo;s also a good training. As you try to make sounds with the Kazoo, your vocal folds will learn how to coordinate better (to get that pure sound).</p><p>Conversely, if I just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> get a good sound out of it, I know I just have to stop trying for the day. Today is a &ldquo;bad voice day&rdquo; and forcing my voice would just make that worose.</p><h3 id=those-are-loud-exercises>Those are loud exercises!</h3><p>I understand these first two exercises are hard. I struggle with this still, because I&rsquo;m always surrounded by people and I don&rsquo;t want to be a loud annoying housemate.</p><p>What else can you do?</p><h3 id=vocal-fry>Vocal fry</h3><p>This one is hard to explain, but most people can do it.</p><p>Try to make a sound by connecting your vocal folds <em>as little as possible</em>. This will likely create a thin, raspy sound. Like you just woke up, or you&rsquo;re a little sick.</p><p>Really aim for making a sound with the <em>least effort possible</em>. It can help to lay on your back, looking up at the ceiling. (This interferes with your normal &ldquo;habits&rdquo; of speaking using too much effort.)</p><p>This is called &ldquo;vocal fry&rdquo;. Practice this. Try to control it and easily reach this state.</p><p>Why? Because that means you can feel and control <em>how tight your vocal folds connect</em>. You train the coordination needed to have a balanced onset.</p><h3 id=the-best-and-hardest-exercise>The best and hardest exercise</h3><p>This exercise actually taught me how this feels and what a difference it makes.</p><p>Pick an easy open sound, like &ldquo;ah&rdquo; or &ldquo;oh&rdquo;. Repeat this, over and over, but <em>faster and faster</em>.</p><ul><li>So the first one is just &ldquo;aaaaaaaaah&rdquo; until your breath runs out.</li><li>Then &ldquo;aaaaaah aaaaaah&rdquo;</li><li>Then &ldquo;aaaaah aaaah aaaaah&rdquo;</li><li>And so forth until you&rsquo;re making this sound &ldquo;rapid fire&rdquo;.</li></ul><p>What should you notice? When you go faster, your vocal onset has less time and must be more relaxed. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t repeat notes that quickly!</p><p>But by sliding into that, by starting slow, this happens automatically for most people.</p><p>When you come to the fast repetitions (&ldquo;ah ah ah ah ah&rdquo;), your sound will probably be clear and clean.</p><p>This one can be <em>hard</em> at first. But that&rsquo;s a sign that your vocal onset just isn&rsquo;t great &mldr; yet. Keep at it. If it&rsquo;s too hard, stop before the repetitions get really fast.</p><p>Try different vowels. Start with the one easiest for you, move towards the hardest.</p><p>I recommend doing this <em>before</em> singing anything. When your onset is right, easy notes will follow. It doesn&rsquo;t need to take long: just 30&ndash;60 seconds.</p><p>But by the time you&rsquo;re done, your onset is fast and snappy, instead of slow and muddy.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/singing-and-speaking/relaxing/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Relaxing</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/singing-and-speaking/articulation/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>Articulation</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
