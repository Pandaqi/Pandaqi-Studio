I mean, I&rsquo;ve explained the importance of <em>rhyming</em> ten times&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a concept most people will only know from language!</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll first explain what&rsquo;s new and different. This chapter assumes you already have your melody, and add lyrics afterward.</p><p>Next chapter I&rsquo;ll talk about when the lyrics come first, and the melody second. Then I&rsquo;ll also give some quick examples about how the previous principles apply.</p><h2 id=whats-our-goal>What&rsquo;s our goal?</h2><p>What&rsquo;s the point of lyrics? To &mldr;</p><ul><li>Convey a melody (in a nice way)</li><li>Convey a message or emotion</li></ul><p>You can choose, for yourself, which is more important. But to me, I&rsquo;d always pick something that <em>sounds good</em> over the other.</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t always the case. I have many songs, from when I was a kid, where I really tried to <em>cram</em> all my beautiful sentences onto melodies where they just didn&rsquo;t fit. I was more concerned with proper grammar and telling a novel, than anything else.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s the issue. You&rsquo;re <em>not</em> telling a novel. You&rsquo;re creating music. If you care 100% about your message or topic, you&rsquo;d <em>write a novel</em> or <em>give a speech</em>. Those are ideal for that purpose.</p><p>Music is about emotion and entertainment, first and foremost. If your &ldquo;message&rdquo; gets in the way of that, nobody <em>wants</em> to listen to the song, so it isn&rsquo;t <em>heard</em> anyway.</p><p>It also means you shouldn&rsquo;t preach. Another beginner mistake: writing a song like you&rsquo;re <em>explaining</em> or <em>convincing</em> the listener. You&rsquo;re not. Songs are about the singer <em>conveying</em> some feeling or thought in a musical way. Give preference to the emotion and to <em>your viewpoint</em>. The listener will decide or interpret however they want.</p><h2 id=lyrics-that-fit>Lyrics that fit</h2><p>Lyrics that <em>sound good</em> are more important. So let&rsquo;s start there.</p><blockquote><p>You&rsquo;re more than allowed to play with grammar or distort words if that <em>sounds better</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Listen to popular singers. They most likely pronounce certain sounds in an odd way. For <em>their</em> songs (or voice), it sounds wonderful and better.</p><p>Similarly, sounds are often stretched or repeated.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Day&rdquo; might become two syllables: &ldquo;Da-y&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Heart&rdquo; might become &ldquo;Ha-Ha-Heart&rdquo;</li><li>Any vowel can be stretched over multiple pitches: &ldquo;Hee-ee-eey&rdquo;</li></ul><p>And we all know some popular songs that commit grammar crimes left and right.</p><p>My tip is to give preference to this, if possible. Find words and sounds that <em>fit with your melody</em>. Once that fit perfectly and complement it.</p><p>Start there. Start by listing words or sentences that would fit your melody. Once you have a few amazing pieces, use the rest of the lyrics to make it <em>mean</em> something.</p><blockquote><p>You are not allowed to break rhythm at will to sneak an extra syllable in there (or remove one)</p></blockquote><p>And you know why! Because any sudden change to that rhythm of the notes will feel odd and ugly to us. Listeners will <em>know</em> you only did that so that the words actually fit the melody.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t change a rhythm that works. Change the words&mdash;or in what way you sing them&mdash;to fit the music.</p><h3 id=side-note-not-for-everyone>Side note: not for everyone</h3><p>Different genres have different &ldquo;sounds&rdquo; that are common. Or, conversely, sounds that just kill the mood.</p><p>Singing &ldquo;Night&rdquo; like you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;I&rdquo;, spread over three notes, is fine in a pop song.</p><p>In musical theatre, that won&rsquo;t do. There, diction is important. Text needs to fit the melody perfectly and be understood by all.</p><p>Conversely, a heavy vibrato is fine there, while a punk singer with vibrato wouldn&rsquo;t be great.</p><p>Research the common sounds for your genre. Apply those.</p><h3 id=practical-tips>Practical tips</h3><p>Some words just sound good and other&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll only learn this through experience. (It&rsquo;d be quite useless to provide a long list here of all the words I can think of.) You probably already thought of a few clichés, like &ldquo;heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;hurt&rdquo;.</p><p>These are mostly emotional words. Yes, the sound is determined by the <em>actual sound</em> (and how much emotion you can put into it), but also the <em>meaning</em>. I mean, &ldquo;you&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t far from &ldquo;poop&rdquo;. But I can&rsquo;t for the life of me imagine someone singing poop and actually sounding good while doing it.</p><p>In general,</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s easier to manipulate short, well-known words.</li><li>Alternatively, a lyric sounds more sophisticated and strong if you use <em>longer words</em>.</li></ul><p>Turning &ldquo;Day&rdquo; into &ldquo;Da-y&rdquo; won&rsquo;t create issues. People will <em>still</em> understand it and it&rsquo;s easy to make the change. Manipulating the sound or rhythm of &ldquo;condescendingly&rdquo; is a tougher task.</p><p>But if you <em>can</em> fit such long words on the melody, it&rsquo;s magic. It&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s rare. That&rsquo;s why people notice it and it &ldquo;feels&rdquo; right. The important part, of course, is that the syllables match, especially the <em>emphasized</em> syllable.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This might actually be a great challenge. Find some long words. Try to put them to a melody, and they need to fit perfectly.</p></div><h2 id=lyrics-that-mean-something>Lyrics that mean something</h2><p>For me, this is usually the second step. And often it&rsquo;s not much of a step at all. By now, you basically have your whole song; you only need to &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo;.</p><p>This means you probably already <em>have</em> a theme or topic. There&rsquo;s already an emotion to the words. In the meantime, your brain already worked out what it wanted to say.</p><p>Look at what you have and try to make it as strong as possible. Remember, we&rsquo;re not preaching or explaining. You are writing from a <em>personal emotion</em> or <em>experience</em>.</p><p>This is one of the fun quirks of humans. Nobody wants to listen to a song in which you <em>tell</em> them to, I don&rsquo;t know, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t break promises&rdquo;. But they&rsquo;ll listen to a song in which you tell a story about how <em>you</em> broke a promise and ended up feeling worse for it&mdash;which clearly has the same message.</p><h3 id=exploration>Exploration</h3><p>Art is mostly an <strong>exploration</strong> of a topic or feeling. That&rsquo;s what lyrics should be. It&rsquo;s similar to an essay, but with the key difference that logic or arguments aren&rsquo;t our focal point here.</p><p>Remember, we&rsquo;re still not making a <em>Powerpoint presentation</em>.</p><p>Instead,</p><ul><li>The first few lines throw something interesting out there. Something worth exploring.</li><li>The rest of the song talks about it in different ways. Maybe different emotions, different perspectives, different consequences, or just the same thing in different words.</li></ul><p>The verse offers something. A thought, a problem, a situation. Start with a few sentences that are intriguing, or mysterious, or clearly set a tone.</p><p>Then the chorus moves to the most emotional moment. A decision, a terrible consequence, or a really <em>happy</em> feeling. It&rsquo;s like giving a summary of the most emotional highlight from this topic.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo; or &ldquo;answer to a problem&rdquo;. Because,</p><ul><li>That&rsquo;d be preaching or teaching again</li><li>Where do you go from there? Your first chorus concludes your story &mldr; what then? (If you conclude, make that the last sentence of your song.)</li><li>The best topics for songs <em>have</em> no conclusion or answer</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I think about the song &ldquo;Case of You&rdquo; by Joni Mitchell. Beautiful song, beautiful vocals. But look at the lyrics:</p><ul><li>The choruses are about the highlight. This feeling of being so in love, expressed in one strong thought. She could &ldquo;drink a case of you, and I&rsquo;d still be on my feet&rdquo; This is a summary of the topic. This is what you remember, the one-liner that expresses the feeling best.</li><li>The verses all provide different scenarios around this. Things the other person told her. A warning from another about the person. Her own faults or mistakes and how they interact with this love. Different ways to explain the same feeling.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s an exploration of the feeling of such love, in beautiful musical form.</p></div><p>Yes, exploration is the key word. Don&rsquo;t start making mind-maps, or doing word association tricks, or getting a (rhyming) dictionary. You have a strong melody and some strong sounds you want to use.</p><p>Find a common ground, a good topic, a feeling inside you. And <em>explore</em> that. Doing the exploration during verses or quieter parts, and providing the highlight or the strongest emotion in the chorus and bridge.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>And exploration means making mistakes. Means trying stuff. Maybe you write a few sentences, then wake up the next day and realize just how bad they are. Now you can try something <em>better</em>. No good song will come from somebody who assumes they have all the answers or dares not take any emotional risk.</p></div><h3 id=writing-skill>Writing skill</h3><p>But no matter how many tips I give, lyric writing is obviously a <strong>writing</strong> skill. You need a good understanding of language to do it. It&rsquo;s hard to communicate anything if you don&rsquo;t know the words or the linguistic structure.</p><p>Even then, some vocabulary or grammar rules aren&rsquo;t enough. Knowing the theory does <em>not</em> imply you can apply the theory (well). It takes more skill than that to put multiple sentences to the same rhythm. To find rhyme words that sound good, but aren&rsquo;t cliché or contrived.</p><p>Usually, there are sharper ways to say what you want to say. A beginner might write a sentence of thirty words to convey a feeling. An experienced writer can do the same in ten <em>stronger</em> words.</p><p>A experienced writer will also know many small &ldquo;rules&rdquo; to make a lyric better, such as</p><ul><li>Emphasis is automatically added to words at the start or end.</li><li>Repetition is great when intended (and a few words apart), not if you accidentally use the same words over and over. (Something like &ldquo;Love is great, love is amazing, love is lovely oh I love love.&rdquo; is repetition &mldr; but hardly an easy lyric to make work.)</li><li>Active and direct voice is usually better. (Humans tend to &ldquo;hedge&rdquo;, adding all these filler words, or writing sentences in passive voice. It just adds noise and muddles the message.)</li></ul><p>This is, again, not in the realm of this course. You can check out some of my <a href=../../../writing/>Writing</a> courses.</p><p>Or just read, write and speak a lot. Consume many different types of media in the language of choice. And simply <em>try</em> songwriting a lot, giving yourself feedback as you go.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>I wrote a whole course about <a href=../../../life-skills/how-to-learn-anything/>How to learn anything</a>. It outlines simple habits, supported by science and practice, to actually pick up new skills really fast. And in a way that&rsquo;s fun, instead of feeling like homework.</p></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rules-and-patterns/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Rules & Patterns</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/songwriting/lyrics-ii/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Lyrics II</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
