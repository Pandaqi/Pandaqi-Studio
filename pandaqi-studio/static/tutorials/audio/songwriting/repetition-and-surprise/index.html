In fact, it&rsquo;s even more important and it&rsquo;s even easier to see it in action. It&rsquo;s the principle of <strong>Repetition & Surprise</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>A piece of art is usually deemed &ldquo;good&rdquo; if it has a nice mix of repetitive elements and surprising elements</p></blockquote><p>You might also call it <strong>Familiar & New</strong> or <strong>Structure & Variation</strong>. This principle applies to a whole song as well as the details within.</p><p>What does it mean?</p><h2 id=repetition>Repetition</h2><p>Well, listen to any popular song, and you&rsquo;ll probably notice they all follow some general <em>structure</em>.</p><ul><li>Verse, chorus, verse, chorus, &mldr;</li><li>Usually, each verse has the same melody. A chorus often has the same melody <em>and</em> lyrics.</li><li>Within each section, melody lines or phrases might be repeated. They might follow a certain rhyming or rhythmic scheme.</li></ul><p>When you look at this, you&rsquo;ll notice songs are at least 50% <em>repetition</em> and a <em>common structure</em>. But that&rsquo;s not 100% of the story&mdash;that&rsquo;d mean all songs are just the same sentence over and over! It provides a good <em>foundation</em> on which to build a creative and unique song.</p><h2 id=surprise>Surprise</h2><p>The other 50% comes from <em>surprise</em> and <em>new elements</em>. <strong>Rhyming</strong> is this principle on steroids. You <em>repeat</em> the sound of a word, but <em>vary</em> it slightly so that the two words rhyme. Our brains love that!</p><ul><li>Even though similar, no verse is usually the same. Through new lyrics and perhaps a changed melody here or there, you add variety to the structure.</li><li>Again, even though very similar, no chorus is usually <em>identical</em>. Later choruses often change a few lines or raise the pitch. Again, 99% structure, just that sprinkle of surprise.</li><li>The instrumentation for the whole song is mostly the same, but once in a while an instrument is dropped or added.</li></ul><p>Sometimes people call this the &ldquo;hook&rdquo;: the surprising melody change that <em>captures</em> listeners. Without a hook, there&rsquo;s nothing unique or exciting to capture somebody.</p><p>Conversely, without <em>structure</em> the song is incoherent and chaotic. The listener will have a hard time &ldquo;getting into it&rdquo; or knowing what they&rsquo;re even listening to. That&rsquo;s why pop songs focus more on <em>structure</em> (so they&rsquo;re easy to digest), but therefore all sound similar.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the lesson?</p><ul><li>You can <em>start</em> a song by using a well-known, common structure. But make sure to add enough variety to make it better.</li><li>Alternatively, if your song feels incoherent or like a mess, purposely add <em>structure</em> to it.</li></ul><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Sometimes, I have several loosely related musical ideas that appear over time. If I just place them one after another, it&rsquo;d sound horrible. Sudden changes in tempo, rhythm, key, lyrical theme, etcetera. So what do you do? You decide a few &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for the song and force each idea to follow them. You might decide &ldquo;the key is X&rdquo; and &ldquo;the lyrics are about Y&rdquo;. You might keep one idea <em>only</em> for the bridge or the outro, so the rest of the song can be more repetitive.</p></div><p>The more songs you write, the more you&rsquo;ll understand the exact balance between these two topics.</p><p>This principle will be the common thread in the following chapters. With songwriting, it can be applied in four major ways:</p><ul><li>Rhythm</li><li>Pitch</li><li>Lyrics</li><li>Arrangement ( or Instrumentation)</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll only give a general example here, then continue. See it as a taste of what&rsquo;s to come.</p><h2 id=example-crafting-a-melody>Example: crafting a melody</h2><h3 id=start-with-structure>Start with structure</h3><p>We start with a &ldquo;melody&rdquo; that is nothing but one repetitive structure. Always the same note, always the same length.

We want to change things, but still in a way that is predictable. Still following a pattern of sorts. (Otherwise, starting with structure doesn&rsquo;t matter.

In a way, we&rsquo;ve now divided our melodic idea into two parts.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><div class=midi-data data-tempo=120 data-time=4/4 data-strict data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=absolute data-transpose data-metronome style=display:none>F3/2 F3/1 F3/1 F3/2 F3/1 F3/1</div><canvas class=midi-canvas width=1920 height=1080 style=width:100%>Your browser doesn't support canvas :(</canvas><aside class=midi-player-metadata><button class="masked big-mask mask-7 midi-button-play">
