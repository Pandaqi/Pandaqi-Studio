As always, I&amp;rsquo;ll be efficient and don&amp;rsquo;t waste your time. Yes, there are ten chapters, but each is quite short and has many examples.</description></item><item><title>What do I need?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/what-do-i-need/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/what-do-i-need/</guid><description>Technically, all you need for songwriting is something to write down the song. Pen on paper works. Typing on a laptop as well.</description></item><item><title>Where do I start?</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/where-do-i-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/where-do-i-start/</guid><description>The short answer is: anywhere you like.

In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s even more important and it&amp;rsquo;s even easier to see it in action.</description></item><item><title>Rhythm I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rhyhtm-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rhyhtm-i/</guid><description>I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. Rhythm? Really? That&amp;rsquo;s where you want to start? Yes, no doubt about it. We&amp;rsquo;re all so focused on pitches, but rhythm is actually king.</description></item><item><title>Rhythm II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rhyhtm-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rhyhtm-ii/</guid><description>As promised, this chapter focuses on specific tips you can immediately apply to your songwriting.

These chapters were, therefore, called &amp;ldquo;pitch&amp;rdquo; at first. But that seemed like a weird title&amp;mdash;one that many people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find when searching for it.</description></item><item><title>Melody II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/melody-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/melody-ii/</guid><description>As promised, this chapter gives all my practical tips about writing melody. But first, we discuss the one truth that explains all of them.</description></item><item><title>Rules &amp; Patterns</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rules-and-patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rules-and-patterns/</guid><description>I wanted to explain this earlier.

One melodic line. To finish this guide, we need to take the obvious last step: how to combine multiple great melodies?</description></item><item><title>Arrangement II</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/arrangement-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting/arrangement-ii/</guid><description>In this last chapter, I&amp;rsquo;ll give specific practical tips for designing another melody against an existing melody.
