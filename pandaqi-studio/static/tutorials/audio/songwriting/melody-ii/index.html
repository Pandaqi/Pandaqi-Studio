But first, we discuss the one truth that explains all of them.</p><h2 id=all-pitch-is-relative>All pitch is relative</h2><p>Pitches, by themselves, don&rsquo;t have any value. It&rsquo;s not like the &ldquo;F&rdquo; is always sad, and the &ldquo;D&rdquo; always uplifting.</p><p>No, pitches are <em>relative</em>. They get meaning, or have an effect, based on what is around them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same principle of contrast from before. If all your pitches are very high, none of them feel high. If your whole song does the same huge jumps between notes, then they don&rsquo;t feel huge anymore after thirty seconds.</p><p>This gives pitches several interesting properties:</p><ul><li>Their feeling or meaning depends on their distance to the <em>tonic</em> of the scale.</li><li>They want to &ldquo;resolve&rdquo;. They want to go &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo;. (Some more than others.)</li><li>They are fluid. For example, our voice can &ldquo;slide&rdquo; from one note to another, hitting all the pitches between. (Something you can&rsquo;t do with rhythm.)</li></ul><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Similarly, a pitch sounds different if the supporting instrumentation&mdash;a chord playing at the same time, for example&mdash;is different. But more on that later, in the chapters about <a href=../arrangement-i/>Arrangement</a></p></div><p>Hopefully, you start to understand why I started with rhythm. It has a more strict, predictable structure&mdash;which, if you break it, often immediately sounds terrible. Pitch, on the other hand, can do whatever it likes.</p><h2 id=principle-1-understand-how-notes-feel>Principle 1: Understand how notes feel</h2><p>Because pitches are relative, music theory often names them <em>relative to the tonic</em> (or &ldquo;root note).</p><p>For a C Major scale, you&rsquo;d get &mldr;</p><ul><li>C = Tonic</li><li>D = Second</li><li>E = Third</li><li>F = Fourth</li><li>G = Fifth</li><li>A = Sixth</li><li>B = Seventh</li></ul><p>As you see, they simply count up from the root note. No matter how simple, this is a <em>powerful</em> tool.</p><p>Because, in general, you can assign these meanings to the notes.</p><ul><li><strong>Tonic</strong> = home, safe, at rest, everything wants to come back here.</li><li><strong>Second</strong> = warm, cozy, soft, relative safety.</li><li><strong>Third</strong> = also feels safe, but more exciting and harmonious at the same time. (It&rsquo;s an actual jump away from home.)</li><li><strong>Fourth</strong> = this is decidedly <em>not</em> home, but it&rsquo;s the second best thing. It feels warm and soothing, without strongly wanting to go somewhere.</li><li><strong>Fifth</strong> = it&rsquo;s the second most important note of the scale (&ldquo;perfect fifth&rdquo;). It harmonizes the best with the tonic and really loves going back to it. The jump is large enough to provide excitement and surprise.</li><li><strong>Sixth</strong> = this often has a magical fairytale quality to it, a more &ldquo;surprising&rdquo; jump away from the tonic. It could resolve to a number of places, though people often choose the fifth.</li><li><strong>Seventh</strong> = the most dissonant and tension-filled note. It <em>strongly</em> wants to go home, or anywhere else really.</li><li><strong>Octave</strong> = a full octave leap is very energetic, powerful and uplifting. It will always work, because, well, the tonic sounds good with itself.</li></ul><p>In general, low notes bring rest, safety and warmth. High notes bring excitement and power.</p><p>Depending on other factors (scale, support instruments, vocal, &mldr;) these moods will shift. But the list above is generally true.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The &ldquo;Tonic - Fourth&rdquo; cadence is also called the plagal cadence and well-known for its meandering sound. It doesn&rsquo;t want to go anywhere. It can just keep going forever, switching between tonic and fourth. Like the sound of a babbling brook at a lazy summer evening.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Ed Sheeran&rsquo;s acoustic music has a soft, &ldquo;sitting by the campfire&rdquo; vibe. If you look at the notes, he often creates melodies entirely out of seconds and thirds.</p></div><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I once studied the legendary composer John Williams for several days. And I noticed a potential reason why his melodies are so strong and memorable: they often have full octave leaps, or a large jump <em>somewhere</em>. He goes out of his way to &mldr; go out of his way :p</p></div><p>When stuck, apply this knowledge.</p><p>You want to write a soft lullaby? Go for those seconds and thirds. Go for warm notes that don&rsquo;t really want to go somewhere. Limit tension or energetic jumps.</p><p>You want to write a powerful rock song? Keep the verse more monotone, then go for <em>huge jumps</em> and <em>notes that want to resolve</em> everywhere.</p><p>For example, here&rsquo;s the start of a lullaby song I once wrote for a musical. It uses only jumps of a second or a third.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><div class=midi-data data-tempo=160 data-time=4/4 data-strict data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=absolute data-transpose data-metronome style=display:none>F3/1 F3/1 G3/1 A3/1 | F3/3 F3/1 | A3/1 C4/1 C4/1 A3/1 | C4/2 A#3/2 |</div><canvas class=midi-canvas width=1920 height=1080 style=width:100%>Your browser doesn't support canvas :(</canvas><aside class=midi-player-metadata><button class="masked big-mask mask-1 midi-button-play">

Let&rsquo;s go more in-depth now. Because it <em>is</em> a topic worthy of such discussion!</p><p>People like art because of this effect: tension and release. Because we love the feeling of <em>release</em>. We love that feeling of letting go, solving a problem, relaxing. But we can only <em>get that</em> if we first experience tension.</p><blockquote><p>A song only connects emotionally if it builds enough tension&mdash;and then releases it entirely.</p></blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate here. That&rsquo;s a mistake I made for a long time. Writing songs that were too &ldquo;soft&rdquo; and &ldquo;meandering&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want to add too much tension or take too much risk, scared it would annoy people.</p><p>The result? Songs that all sound the same. They are all &ldquo;okay&rdquo; but nobody really loves them. Because they lack that cycle of tension and release.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Or take stories as another example. Stories are all about <em>conflict</em>. Somebody wants something but the writer invents <em>obstacles</em> to put in their way. Then, at the end, the main character will probably achieve that goal or at least overcome the obstacle. First we build a lot of tension, which is nice. But the story becomes great if we properly release that tension in the end.</p></div><p><em>How to apply this?</em> Add tension on purpose, then followed by release. Both for the big picture (the whole song) and the smaller details (individual melodic lines).</p><p>That&rsquo;s where the &ldquo;verse-chorus-bridge&rdquo; structure comes from! We start the song at low intensity. We ramp it up with the chorus. Up, up, up, until the bridge/solo goes <em>all out</em> and has maximum intensity. But we don&rsquo;t just stop randomly at some point during the solo. Songs take time to climb down their mountain and go back to a lower intensity ending.</p><p>This is another reason why I recommend <em>starting</em> with well-known structures. There&rsquo;s a good reason for their existence. Once you have some experience with them, you can break the rules and try other structures.</p><p>On a smaller level, you could &mldr;</p><ul><li>Use a note <em>not</em> from the scale; then go back to following the scale again.</li><li>Use more dissonant or unexpected notes, such as the sixth and the seventh. Usually, they resolve to the tonic or the fifth afterward.</li><li>Use a pattern that is clearly going somewhere. For example, if your notes keep going higher and higher, the listener is <em>waiting</em> for the moment you get to the highest note. The longer this moment is delayed, the more tension will build inside of them.</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s an example with a tense (dissonant) note before returning home. When that note (A#) appears, you build tension, wanting it to resolve to something else.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><div class=midi-data data-tempo=120 data-time=4/4 data-strict data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=traditional data-transpose data-metronome style=display:none>D3/4 F3/4 A3/4 F3/4 | C#3/8.

Four phrases, takes time to execute. But it&rsquo;s really just three parts copied and rhyming with each other.</p><p>Again, this isn&rsquo;t lazy. Nobody has called that song lazy, right? This is the perfect balance between structure and surprise. This is what humans feel is <em>good art</em> and <em>interesting</em>.</p><h2 id=principle-4-the-mountain-approach>Principle 4: The mountain approach</h2><p>Alright, all these principles are great. But they&rsquo;re mostly helpful if you already have a good melody in your head or know your way around <em>some</em> instruments / music theory.</p><p>What if that isn&rsquo;t applicable? First, remember what I explained at <a href=../where-do-i-start/>Where do I start?</a>. Inspiration can come from anywhere. Prime your brain, give it time, and it will come.</p><p>Besides that, I think the &ldquo;mountain approach&rdquo; is the most useful. Here&rsquo;s the idea:</p><ul><li>Start the melody at a low or safe note</li><li>Place your most important note somewhere near 2/3. (The highest, the most dissonant, the most surprising, whatever.)</li><li>And end with a safe note again</li><li>So you can repeat / loop this melody.</li></ul><p>This shapes your melody somewhat like a mountain. You merely need to fill the space between the notes. And now you have tools to do so:</p><ul><li>Create jumps that match your feeling</li><li>Invent a <em>pattern</em> (like &ldquo;two up, then one down&rdquo;) and repeat it in varying ways</li><li>Use longer notes or silence to fill some space, reserve shorter notes for the meat of the melody</li></ul><p>Once you&rsquo;ve played with that, you can move the mountain. Start with your most important note and only go down. End with your most important note, so you can immediately <em>race</em> into the chorus.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a really simple idea that will work 100% of the time. It won&rsquo;t generate the most creative or inspired melodies, but it&rsquo;s a great starting point.</p><p>For example, here&rsquo;s our mountain structure</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><div class=midi-data data-tempo=120 data-time=4/4 data-strict data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=absolute data-transpose data-metronome style=display:none>G#3/2 R/2 | R/2 D#4/2 | R/2 G#3/2 |</div><canvas class=midi-canvas width=1920 height=1080 style=width:100%>Your browser doesn't support canvas :(</canvas><aside class=midi-player-metadata><button class="masked big-mask mask-5 midi-button-play">

But now that you know scales&mdash;and that they are just a pattern you can look up&mdash;you already know enough!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re really stuck, pick a random <em>scale</em> and a random <em>chord scheme</em> within it. Just play the chords on a loop. Then try to create a melody over them. (By using notes from the scale, or maybe just notes from the same chord.)</p><p>Melodies are harder to find online. (There&rsquo;s no great way to communicate them, unless you resort to sheet music or a tab for the guitar. Even then, rarely does anybody tab anything more than the <em>guitar solo</em> for the song.)</p><p>But chords? They are abundant! Look up the chords for your favorite song. Copy them, play them, use them to invent your own melodies.</p><p>Below is an example using the &ldquo;four pop chords&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t know what those are, look up the &ldquo;Four Chord Song&rdquo; by Axis of Awesome. They show you, in a funny way, how every single pop song is written using these chords. Notice how the melody just picks a note or two from the chord supporting it.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><figcaption class=side-note><span>Chords are C, G, Am, F.</span></figcaption><div class=midi-data data-tempo=120 data-time=4/4 data-strict=true data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=absolute data-transpose data-metronome style=display:none>:R/2 C4/1 E4/1 | B3/4 | E4/1 C4/1 E4/1 C4/1 | A3/1 G3/1 F3/2 |
