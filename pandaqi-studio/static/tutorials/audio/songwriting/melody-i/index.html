These chapters were, therefore, called &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; at first. But that seemed like a weird title&mdash;one that many people wouldn&rsquo;t find when searching for it. Hence the name <em>melody</em>.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll see that most of the principles from <a href=../rhythm-I/>Rhythm</a> apply here just as well. But first, let&rsquo;s focus on what makes pitch <em>different</em>.</p><h2 id=keys>Keys</h2><p>First, a quick refresher on some basic terminology.</p><p>In Western music, at least, we divide the musical notes into <strong>octaves</strong>. These octaves repeat from low to high in exactly the same way. You can see it most easily on a piano.</p><p>Within the octave, we have 12 notes. The 7 white notes on a piano are your letters (C,D,E,F,G,A,B), the 5 black notes are your sharps (C#,D#,&mldr;).</p><p>People often say that a song is in &ldquo;the key of X&rdquo;. What does that mean? A <strong>key</strong> means that you simply &mldr;</p><ul><li>Pick one of those available notes</li><li>And build a <em>scale</em> around it.</li></ul><p>When it comes to pitches, you&rsquo;ll be worrying about the balance between <em>following</em> that (structured) scale and <em>breaking free</em> from it.</p><h2 id=scales>Scales</h2><p>We saw that rhythms usually follow a structure. You start with a certain beat, and any other note is a multiple or subdivision of that timing.</p><p><strong>Scales</strong> do the same thing for pitches. They tell you which pitches are <em>consonant</em> (they sound well together) or <em>dissonant</em> (they usually sound bad). Given a key and an octave, they tell you which of the notes you should play, and which to avoid.</p><blockquote><p>When writing a melody, start by sticking to a scale.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not <em>required</em>. You can change scales. You can borrow notes from another scale. There are no hard rules in music&mdash;only what &ldquo;sounds good&rdquo; to you.</p><p>But almost <em>all</em> music you know follows one scale. And it&rsquo;s a great structure to start with. It&rsquo;s easier to start with a scale and add some surprise notes later, than the other way around.</p><p>What scales exist? <em>Many</em>. That&rsquo;s Music Theory again, which this guide isn&rsquo;t really about.</p><p>These days, you can easily search for images or videos on how to play any scale. I suggest you start with the &ldquo;Major&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minor&rdquo; scale. They are the easiest and most common.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I learned most of the scales through improvising, as mentioned before. That&rsquo;s how I learned what sounds well together and what doesn&rsquo;t. I might not know the <em>official name</em> for what I play, but I know its a valid scale.</p></div><p>In general, though, all scales follow a simple &ldquo;rule&rdquo; or &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; on how they use the notes in an octave.</p><h2 id=example-major-scale>Example: major scale</h2><p>Below is the major scale. First in words, then as an audiovisual example.</p><ul><li>Start at any note. (This is the <strong>tonic</strong>.

If you play notes one after another, you have more <em>freedom</em> to do as you like. You can throw some notes in there that don&rsquo;t belong to the scale. It&rsquo;s fine, because you hear those notes on their own.</p><p>But when notes are played together, more harmony is often required. You&rsquo;re more restricted in what you can choose &mldr; unless you spread out those notes over a larger distance.</p><p>Listen to the example below. It&rsquo;s in D minor. The melody has some weird notes (C# and B) and it still sounds fine. Because the weird notes don&rsquo;t sound <em>at the same time</em> as those following the scale.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><figcaption class=side-note><span>This is the start of Jack Sparrow's theme from Pirates of the Caribbean.</span></figcaption><div class=midi-data data-tempo=92 data-time=3/4 data-strict=true data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=traditional data-transpose data-metronome style=display:none>R/2 D3/8.

Which, sort of, became the main theme. It sounds great and very memorable, but it uses <em>loads</em> of notes outside of its original scale.</p></div><p>But always remember: there are no rules in music. Anything goes. With pitches, I feel you have more &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; than with rhythm. Because rhythm is <em>felt</em> inside of us, and pitch merely <em>heard</em>.</p><h2 id=different-styles>Different styles</h2><p>In pop/rock music, the pitches are generally all medium height and in the same range. They focus on one or two &ldquo;big notes&rdquo;. (And because of that contrast, the singers sound like they&rsquo;re amazing and can do really high notes.)</p><p>Musical theatre, for example, <em>actually</em> uses many high and low notes. Their songs have a wide range of pitches and rhythms, and you must be able to sing all of them without effort. The whole of &ldquo;Bring Him Home&rdquo; is higher than many pop singers can sing, for example.</p><p>Rap is mostly focused on rhythm, although there is always <em>a</em> pitch being sung. Personally, I like rap that slightly changes pitch in an interesting way, instead of those that are one pitch entirely. Eminem has some songs where the chorus turns more into a pop chorus. But rhythm is <em>definitely</em> the most important here.</p><p>Jazz can do whatever it likes. It jumps between scales, plays more &ldquo;odd&rdquo; notes than expected ones. It&rsquo;s a form of music more focused on improvisation and expression, rather than playing a pre-written song.</p><p>Folk/Country music often has simple melodies that are easy to sing. They go more for a quality that makes the song sound like it &ldquo;has always been there&rdquo; or &ldquo;comes straight from the heart&rdquo;. They do, therefore, focus on long notes full of passion in the melody (even if they aren&rsquo;t that high).</p><p>Punk music often uses melodies with <em>lots of variation</em> (in pitch and rhythm) with <em>almost no time to breathe</em>. They are often a rapid fire of musical ideas smashed together.</p><p>Of course, there are many more styles. But these seemed the most important to mention. Other styles are related to these.</p><p>Next chapter, I&rsquo;ll give you my top principles again. It&rsquo;s a bit longer, because I also want to explain the deeper truth that underpins all of them: <em>all pitch is relative</em>.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/songwriting/rhyhtm-ii/ class="masked big-mask mask-8"><span class=container>Rhythm II</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/songwriting/melody-ii/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Melody II</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
