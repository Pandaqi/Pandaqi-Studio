Everything else is not that important. And if it is, you&rsquo;ll learn those details only from experience and mixing a lot.</p><h2 id=controls>Controls</h2><p>The first trinity is: <strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li>Timing</li><li>Volume</li><li>Panning</li></ul><p>These controls are in every software, and quick to use, because this is what you do 99% of the time. You pick which sounds to play (and when they start/end). You pick their volume. And you pick how to pan them: how much goes to the left ear or the right ear.</p><h2 id=effects>Effects</h2><p>The second trinity is: <strong>Effects</strong></p><ul><li>Compression</li><li>Equalizer (EQ)</li><li>Reverb & Delay</li></ul><p>These are also in every software, bundled by default, readily accessible and usable. Because this is all you need 99% of the time. Compression massages your volume. Equalizer deals with your frequencies. Reverb & Delay handle your space and timing.</p><h2 id=the-3d-space>The 3D space</h2><p>Combined, they give you the <strong>3D space of mixing</strong>! With just these controls and tools, you can <em>place</em> sounds in a 3D space. Which will make your song as pretty and professional as possible. The listener will feel like they&rsquo;re on stage with the band, in a beautiful venue with great acoustics.</p><p>Usually, the listener is placed at the seat of the drummer or the vocalist. From their perspective, place all the other instruments of the band like theyâ€™d be positioned on a stage.</p><p>To me, this is what mixing boils down to. This is all you really need to remember&mdash;or &ldquo;realize&rdquo; at some point in your journey.</p><p>It&rsquo;s your job to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Take a bunch of recordings. (Which sound disconnected and unnatural to our advanced ears. Remember last chapter!)</li><li>And <em>combine</em> them into a single space, as if they&rsquo;re giving a single performance together</li><li>(And on a stage, no two performers will stand on each other&rsquo;s toes! So carve out a space for every part.)</li><li>While sidestepping common issues with audio (recording, digitizing, reproduction, etcetera)</li></ul><p>And just those two trinities&mdash;six concepts in total&mdash;is enough for 99% of that job.</p><p>The details will become more and more clear as you read this guide. But below is a summary to get you started.</p><h3 id=height>Height</h3><p><strong>Height</strong> is the most vague. Our ears are great at hearing if a sound comes from left or right, but <em>not</em> if it&rsquo;s high or low. Still, there&rsquo;s some relationship here that&rsquo;s easy to see: high frequencies feel higher. Similarly, loud or bombastic sounds feel higher.</p><p>This might be because we <em>imagine</em> sounds in our head. So high frequency = high in the air. It might also be because low frequencies can <em>travel</em> through the floor or through objects. And loud sounds usually <em>don&rsquo;t</em> come from below.</p><h3 id=width>Width</h3><p><strong>Width</strong> is more concrete and simple. It comes through panning and delay. Place one instrument in your <em>left</em> ear, the other in your <em>right</em>, and you have width. Or play the same sound on both sides, but <em>delayed</em> in one. Our head will imagine this as a single sound that traveled through that space. This adds width.</p><h3 id=depth>Depth</h3><p><strong>Depth</strong> is most versatile and interesting. This is where 90% of your decision making will be. What parts to pull to the front and send to the back? And <em>how</em> to do it, while keeping it audible or preventing clashes with other elements?</p><p>Some examples are,</p><ul><li>Louder = closer. (Things further away are obviously less loud, as all humans know.)</li><li>Fuller sounds (with all frequencies) = closer. Such sounds have warm / low frequencies and high / crisp ones. (Things further away lose those details, becoming more of a washed-out thin sound.)</li><li>Less reverb = closer. (So an easy way to push something back, is by applying a generous reverb plugin.)</li><li>Spiky transients = closer. (A transient is the loudest part of a sound, when a note is struck or a hit starts. If you cut these off, or smooth them, sounds feel less immediate and further away.)</li></ul><p>And in general, such depth can only come from <em>extremes</em>. If there&rsquo;s not enough <em>contrast</em> between parts, they&rsquo;ll never feel far apart to the listener. So to apply depth, you need to skillfully use the <em>full</em> spectrum of volumes and frequencies that an ear can hear.</p><h2 id=arrangement>Arrangement</h2><p>In my course on <a href=../../songwriting/>Songwriting</a> I talked a great deal about arrangement. It&rsquo;s not just enough to have some chords and some lyrics, a professional song needs a full <em>arrangement</em>: every layer, every instrument, the exact part they&rsquo;ll be playing, the exact tempo (and changes) throughout the song, etcetera.</p><p>With mixing, arrangement isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;important&rdquo;. Mixing <em>is</em> arrangement. It&rsquo;s exactly the same. It&rsquo;s your job to take existing recordings and ideas, then <em>arrange</em> them into that final mix.</p><p>This means you&rsquo;ll spend little time actually <em>writing</em> the song or <em>recording</em> new bits. Instead, mixing is all about finding the right layers that will complement each other. If you already have a few recordings that mostly have <em>low</em> frequencies, purposely choose other recordings that have <em>high</em> frequencies for balance. If the vocal is quite repetitive, imagine tricks or sounds you could add that make the arrangement more varied.</p><p>Throughout the course, I&rsquo;ll give numerous examples of this. But I can tell you this: almost no mix is what you <em>think</em> you hear. When you think it&rsquo;s one guitar, it might actually be 2 or 4. When you think it&rsquo;s one vocal take, it might be ten takes spliced together. When you hear a chorus and think &ldquo;wow that sounds so POWERFUL&rdquo;, you subconsciously hear the ten tricks the audio engineer used to add this power.</p><p>But this also has a downside. If the original recordings are bad&mdash;if the original song is bad&mdash;no amount of mixing can save it. You arrange with what you have. Mixing is not about creating magic from nothing!</p><h2 id=to-infinity-and-beyond>To infinity and beyond!</h2><p>The rest of this course discusses each concept (volume, panning, compression, &mldr;) in-depth using its own article. Now you already know <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> they are important, which should aid the learning process.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t recommend reading this whole guide at once. You&rsquo;ll forget most of it, or only understand something in theory.</p><p>Instead, after reading a new chapter (about the next control or effect), take a break and <em>apply</em> it. See if you can hear for yourself (whatever tip or principle I gave). See if you can break the rules and what that sounds like.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The tool I use for interactive examples was written, by me, using standard website code.
