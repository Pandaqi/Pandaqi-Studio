I, and many others, might use the terms interchangeably. But their meaning remains the same: how <em>loud</em> a track will be played. This is the most important element in all of mixing! That&rsquo;s why this usually gets the <em>big fader</em>. The one you can&rsquo;t miss, the one you can change from <em>everywhere</em> in the DAW.</p><p>The easiest way to start a mix well, is by setting every track to the right volume. That will do 90% of your job. A good volume balance will ensure the most important element (usually vocal) is loudest and easiest to hear, while background elements create a nice tapestry around it.</p><p>The easiest way to make your life a living hell, is by starting your mix somewhere else. Again, I did this when I just started. I&rsquo;d immediately add that <em>cool plugin</em> I just discovered. I&rsquo;d immediately start panning things left and right, using other tricks to place instruments.</p><p>All of that is useless if your volumes are wrong. You&rsquo;ll discover that &mldr; and then you need to remove all the work you did, because with different volumes, everything is different.</p><p><em>But what is the right volume? Do I get any support in this sea of mixing decisions!?</em> Like most, I often felt lost at the start of my mixing journey. But I&rsquo;ve taught myself to always look for one thing when learning a new skill: objective, measurable ideas.</p><p>In other words: ways to <em>check</em> if you&rsquo;re doing it right, removing inexperienced or subjective ears from the process. If I tell you to &ldquo;pick volumes until everything sounds balanced&rdquo;&mdash;that would be absolutely useless advice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Instead, give yourself a blueprint with &mldr;</p><h2 id=the-pink-noise-check>The pink noise check</h2><p>Mixes that sound great usually follow &ldquo;pink noise&rdquo;. Lowest volumes are the loudest and they gradually become softer as you get to the higher frequencies. How <em>fast</em> this happens ( = &ldquo;how much volume you lose per frequency&rdquo;) determines the type of noise.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of different noise types. Especially remember Pink Noise.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=noise_types.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of different noise types. Especially remember Pink Noise." title="Visualization of different noise types. Especially remember Pink Noise." width=855 height=267></picture></figure></p><p>For mixes, you want pink noise. How do we target that?</p><ul><li>Grab yourself a recording of pink noise. (Or a plugin that generates it.)</li><li>Play it continuously / on a loop</li></ul><p>Now turn down all your tracks. Set all volumes to the minimum (usually minus infinity, which means the track is practically muted).</p><blockquote><p>One by one, raise the volume of each track until you can <em>just</em> hear it above the pink noise.</p></blockquote><p>Ta da! Once you&rsquo;ve done all your tracks, your mix will be balanced and have reasonable volumes for everything. (Turn off the pink noise, don&rsquo;t leave it on in your final mix :p)</p><p>From here on, you can tweak. For each section of a song, there&rsquo;s one or two parts that must stand out. They are the highlight. (Like vocals during a verse, or an electric guitar doing a solo.) You&rsquo;ll want to push their volume slightly further. Similarly, if something was meant to be just &ldquo;ear candy&rdquo;, you might want to lower its volume slightly further.</p><p>But in general, this technique is a <em>sure</em> way to quickly get your volumes in the right ballpark. Try it in the example below. Mix each track individually to blend with the pink noise. Once done, <em>mute</em> the noise track and listen to your balanced volumes!</p><figure class="pq-daw-wrapper no-hover" data-tempo=120 data-duration=20 data-caption><div class=daw-tracks><div class=pq-daw-track data-id=Guitar data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=this_year_guitar data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div><div class=pq-daw-track data-id=Drums data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=this_year_drums data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div><div class=pq-daw-track data-id=Vocal data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=this_year_vocals data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div><div class=pq-daw-track data-id=Noise data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects=noise data-out=master data-show data-hide data-master=false></div></div></figure><h2 id=the-vocal-check>The vocal check</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s another check. If your mix has a vocal, it should be the loudest and clearest element. People usually don&rsquo;t realize just how <em>loud</em> and <em>attention-grabbing</em> vocals need to be to sound good.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>My first album with vocals received this feedback time and time again. &ldquo;Your voice is too low!&rdquo; So I pushed it higher. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still too low!&rdquo; I raised it even further. I only accepted defeat until I listened critically to other songs I liked and realized: yes, vocals <em>should</em> be that loud.</p></div><p>How do you check this?</p><ul><li>Play your mix at its lowest volume. One where you can barely hear it, but it&rsquo;s not silent.</li><li>The <em>only</em> element you should be hearing is the vocal.</li></ul><p>At low volume, you should be able to make out the vocal pitch (and perhaps lyrics), but nothing else. It should be like it&rsquo;s an a capella performance.</p><p>Try it in the example above. Remove the noise track (click it + press <code>delete</code>). Now try to mix the vocal using the information above.</p><h2 id=the-drum-and-bass-check>The drum and bass check</h2><p>My final check. Low frequencies (from drum or bass) should be <strong>felt</strong>, not heard. If you can actively hear the bass, it&rsquo;s probably too loud. This is usually accompanied by a &ldquo;thumping&rdquo; or &ldquo;sucking&rdquo; effect in the final song. The low frequencies just <em>overpower</em> everything else.</p><p>Conversely, the high frequencies from the drum (hi-hats, crashes, cymbals) should be louder than you think. Like vocals, they are <em>loud</em> on professional mixes. But somehow, we like that.</p><p>In a way,</p><ul><li>Kick drum/bass conquers the low frequencies</li><li>Vocals conquer the midrange frequencies</li><li>Percussive instruments conquer the high frequencies.</li></ul><p>And I use the word &ldquo;conquer&rdquo; on purpose. One instrument should be the <em>clear loudest</em> in each area, while others subtly fill in the gaps. If you make all instruments in a frequency range <em>equally loud</em>, this sounds like a mess or a mistake.</p><h2 id=volume-creep>Volume creep</h2><p>The two tips above saved my life. They will give you good volumes for all tracks, and the perfect volume for the most important one (vocals). You&rsquo;re almost done!</p><p>In an earlier chapter, I explained how there&rsquo;s a <em>maximum</em> volume that computers can store and reproduce. In digital audio, you can always go <em>lower</em> in volume. That&rsquo;s why we start at 0 and work with negative decibels.</p><p>This has a clear consequence for volume control: <strong>volume creep</strong>. You want louder vocals, so you raise its volume. But now the guitar falls away, so let&rsquo;s raise that as well. Hmm, now the drum doesn&rsquo;t come through that well, let&rsquo;s raise it.</p><p>You raise, and raise, and raise, until you&rsquo;ve hit the ceiling. <em>Everything</em> is loud. And there&rsquo;s nowhere to go.</p><p>How to prevent this?</p><blockquote><p>Instead of raising something you want to be louder, opt for lowering <em>everything around it</em>.</p></blockquote><p>By contrast, that thing will be louder. But you never hit that ceiling. The overall volume of your mix will roughly stay the same as the overall volume used for the recordings.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>If you can hear every part of the song, but there&rsquo;s still a clear highlight and support (without getting in each other&rsquo;s way), you&rsquo;ve done your part. Volumes are good to go.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean the mix will sound <em>great</em> by now. Or that instruments are already placed at their own spot in &ldquo;the 3D space of mixing&rdquo;. Not yet&mdash;you&rsquo;ll probably need some more effects or controls to achieve that.</p><p>Most notably, you want <em>automation</em>. Just because the general track is at a good volume, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s at a perfect volume <em>at all times</em>. There will be specific words, phrases, or sections where you want to nudge the volumes slightly. Only for that part. Only for a little bit. That&rsquo;s what automation does: you &ldquo;animate&rdquo; properties&mdash;such as volume&mdash;over time. And the more you mix, the more time you&rsquo;ll spend here.</p><p>That chapter is coming up soon. But first, let&rsquo;s close our chapters about Controls with the last one: Panning.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/timing/ class="masked big-mask mask-4"><span class=container>Timing</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/panning/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Panning</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
