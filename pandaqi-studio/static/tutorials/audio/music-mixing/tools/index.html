So you should already have your audio, which means I won&rsquo;t talk about microphones, cables, or anything of the sort. Skip this chapter if you already have all your tools!</p><p>Purely for mixing, you only <em>need</em> one tool: <strong>software</strong> on some device. These are called DAWs: Digital Audio Workstations.</p><h2 id=useful-tools>Useful tools</h2><p>But some extra steps are generally recommended. If you have the budget. And more experience than a true novice.</p><h3 id=acoustic-treatment>Acoustic treatment</h3><p>Acoustic treatment is more a <em>must</em> than a recommendation. But this should&rsquo;ve been taken care of before you started recording. It&rsquo;s <em>way more important</em> when recording, than when listening. (Recordings with bad acoustics can&rsquo;t really be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; during the mixing stage.)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve written an in-depth article about it for my recording course: <a href=../../recording/space-i-acoustics/>Acoustics</a>. Simply replace the &ldquo;microphone&rdquo; with &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</p><p>Good acoustic treatment means you can better <em>hear</em> what you&rsquo;re doing. Reverb and noise from your room&mdash;or the outside world&mdash;stop interfering with what you hear. So you can make better mixing decisions.</p><h3 id=midi-controller>MIDI Controller</h3><p>I&rsquo;d recommend some type of <strong>(MIDI) controller</strong>. This could be a MIDI keyboard, maybe with some knobs and dials. Or just a device that&rsquo;s <em>completely</em> knobs, dials and sliders.</p><p>Why? These are your &ldquo;physical&rdquo; workstation. Instead of clicking with your mouse on tiny fake knobs, you <em>actually</em> move physical things in the real world! This is faster, more fun, and allows you to change multiple things at once. Playing with such a controller, you&rsquo;ll find good settings or good sounds more easily.</p><p>Additionally, despite everyone&rsquo;s best effort, a collection of recordings usually isn&rsquo;t enough. You often want to record some quick extra parts or effects for the background.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Maybe the piano sounds a bit thin, but you have no time/money to record more. Grab that MIDI keyboard and play the part on it, using some piano samples. Play it at the same time as the original recording, and it sounds fuller.</p></div><h2 id=choose-your-daw>Choose your DAW</h2><p>There are many options to choose from. I&rsquo;ve tried many, not all.</p><p>I suggest you take <em>some</em> time trying as many as you can. See what works for you, see what you like the most. But once you&rsquo;ve found a favorite? Pick it and <em>stick to it</em>. Otherwise you waste time learning a new DAW regularly, learning new interfaces or buttons&mdash;which means you can&rsquo;t spend that time on actually being productive.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Because yes, other software will always look shinier than the one you use right now. We always want what we don&rsquo;t have.</p></div><p>My ranking of software is based entirely on the user interface: does it <em>look good</em> and is it <em>fast and intuitive</em>?</p><p>You&rsquo;ll be working with it day in, day out. I want something pretty to look at. Any minute gained in productivity, any potential stumbling block prevented, will lead to huge productivity gains in the long run.</p><p>As such, if you care more about included plugins / sounds, or how &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; it is, or the &ldquo;industry standard&rdquo;&mdash;ignore my ranking entirely.</p><h3 id=studio-one>Studio One</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve used this for years. It has a great workflow and user interface that doesn&rsquo;t make me gouge out my eyes. In all those years, I&rsquo;ve only encountered a handful of &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; or &ldquo;annoying issues&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not much, for any software.</p><p>It&rsquo;s relatively cheap. It even has a free version: Studio One Prime.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;jack of all trades&rdquo;. It will have everything you need, without excelling at any specific area of audio engineering.</p><h3 id=logic-pro--garageband>Logic Pro / GarageBand</h3><p>As usual, Apple cares a lot about how software <em>looks</em> and feels. They also care a lot about keeping you in their ecosystem, which is why their software is only available on Mac computers.</p><p>I used these extensively when I still had an iMac (as a kid). They are, again, a jack of all trades. Usable by anyone, can do what you want, but no clear genre or area for which it&rsquo;s meant.</p><h3 id=ableton-live>Ableton Live</h3><p>This is perfect for beats and electronic music. Dance, dubstep, live mixing. For &ldquo;non-standard sounds&rdquo;, such as sound effects for games or instrumental tracks. (Apparently, &ldquo;standard sound&rdquo; means a song or a band to me. Something you could play on the radio.)</p><p>An established brand, includes everything you need, and the interface isn&rsquo;t half bad.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>It&rsquo;s not the type of music I create (often), so after a short demo period I never used it again. But I know it&rsquo;s very popular. And every time I see it, or a tutorial that uses it, I&rsquo;m impressed by what it can do and how clean it looks.</p></div><h3 id=audacity>Audacity</h3><p>This is free! (And open source!) It used to be much lower on the list. Because it could only do some basic audio editing (very well), but would never work as a DAW for full songs or projects. All the effects were <em>destructive</em>: you had to apply them, changing that track permanently.</p><p>But recent updates have solved most of my issues with it. The interface is getting more attractive and user friendly. It now supports non-destructive editing, better track management, and more. Another big update is coming, following the same path.</p><p>I suspect that it will soon be, by far, the best free and open source DAW available.</p><h3 id=reason>Reason</h3><p>This is perfect for people who are more accustomed to the <em>physical</em> equipment used when recording and mixing. It simulates many physical tools and amplifiers in their &ldquo;rack&rdquo;.</p><p>To me, this makes it both very powerful and very limited in what it can do. You will get <em>great</em> sounds on instruments or effects. But it&rsquo;s the opposite of a &ldquo;jack of all trades&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s not an well-rounded DAW that you can use for everything.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Last I checked, it can&rsquo;t record audio. It only works with MIDI and existing files. That&rsquo;s why I, again, deleted it after a short trial period.</p></div><h3 id=reaper>Reaper</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a free unrestricted demo (which you can <em>technically</em> use forever &mldr;). I really like the software itself. Very powerful tools. Some strong ideas. Has always worked well for me.</p><p>It just <em>looks</em> bad. Purely because of the bad visual design, I often have a hard time finding buttons or knowing what to do. I&rsquo;m also not &ldquo;excited&rdquo; to learn that, as it feels more like reading an old book you don&rsquo;t understand.</p><p>I, therefore, use Reaper for a handful of things I <em>know</em> how to do (by heart). It excels at that. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t dare create whole projects inside it.</p><h3 id=waveform-free>Waveform Free</h3><p>It&rsquo;s free! It&rsquo;s a fully functional DAW, although the features are quite barebones. You can upgrade to the pro version for a small price. This will allow you to mix music professionally for free, but don&rsquo;t expect much more.</p><p>It looks <em>fine</em>. The workflow, however, can be unconventional or a bit of a struggle.</p><h3 id=cakewalk>Cakewalk</h3><p>It&rsquo;s free! This software is based on an older DAW that used to be paid (and quite expensive). This makes it very versatile and feature-packed, because it&rsquo;s literally a continued version of a big professional DAW.</p><p>Still, I could never like it. The interface is <em>meh</em>, the workflow is <em>meh</em>. Because it&rsquo;s free, it lacks many great plugins or soundpacks you&rsquo;d get (and need) with paid DAWs. And because it&rsquo;s free, it wants to install all sorts of things on your PC, which I never like.</p><h3 id=avid-pro-tools>(AVID) Pro Tools</h3><p>Yes, this used to be the industry standard for years. For some, it still is. When it comes to <em>workflow</em> (user experience) it&rsquo;s not that bad. Some parts are actually great. When it comes to the <em>look</em>, I&rsquo;m not that happy.</p><p>Due to <em>years</em> of development (and being at the top), the software is bloated and stiff. It&rsquo;s slower and larger than it needs to be. It never tried doing things in a different or better way, stifling innovation and a friendly experience for beginners.</p><p>At the same time, why change? If it worked for the most popular albums ever, it probably works for you. I discarded it because there were cheaper and more modern tools, which seemed like a better fit for my future.</p><h3 id=cubase>Cubase</h3><p>I received the full Cubase system for free with an equipment purchase. I installed it, I tried, and I hated it. It looks <em>awful</em>, I can&rsquo;t say it any other way. The workflow feels archaic and like it&rsquo;s meant to be a struggle.</p><p>I see no clear area in which it shines or excels.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>As you see, I tried most DAWs. (Using trial period, demo, or a free version received when buying equipment.) I was one of those &ldquo;DAW hoppers&rdquo; when I was just a kid. The ranking above feels solid and fair to me.</p><p>But you can do the same. Try different workflows. Look at the interface with your own eyes. Do you want to look at that every day? Do you immediately understand what buttons do? Set yourself a simple challenge in each software&mdash;something you do or need a lot&mdash;and see which one makes that the easiest.</p><p><em>I have not tried Bitwig Studio or FL Studio, so I can&rsquo;t comment. I&rsquo;ve heard good things about the first, and the interface of the second is an example of good aesthetics and visual design. That&rsquo;s it.</em></p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-3d-space/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>The 3D space</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/how-to-use-a-daw/ class="masked big-mask mask-7"><span class=container>How to use a DAW</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
