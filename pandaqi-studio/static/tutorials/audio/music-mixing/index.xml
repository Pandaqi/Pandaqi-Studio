That means you should already have your arrangement ( = a song written down fully) and your recordings of that arrangement.</description></item><item><title>The Disconnect I</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-disconnect-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-disconnect-i/</guid><description>I also wrote a great chapter about this topic for my recording course: The Disconnect. That one focuses more on details and examples related to recording.</description></item><item><title>The Disconnect II: Sound Waves</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-disconnect-ii-how-audio-works/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-disconnect-ii-how-audio-works/</guid><description>I want to give some basic terminology and understanding about what audio waves actually are. These terms are very common in the field, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to know them.</description></item><item><title>The 3D space</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-3d-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-3d-space/</guid><description>To me, mixing is about two &amp;ldquo;holy trinities&amp;rdquo;. Everything else is not that important. And if it is, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn those details only from experience and mixing a lot.</description></item><item><title>Tools</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/tools/</guid><description>As stated, this course is only about mixing. So you should already have your audio, which means I won&amp;rsquo;t talk about microphones, cables, or anything of the sort.</description></item><item><title>How to use a DAW</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/how-to-use-a-daw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/how-to-use-a-daw/</guid><description>Alright, you&amp;rsquo;ve installed your software (DAW). You understand the general purpose of music mixing, what makes it hard and what to do about that.</description></item><item><title>Starting a project</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/starting-a-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/starting-a-project/</guid><description>Previous chapter gave you all the tools for working with a DAW! This chapter can, therefore, be quite simple.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/monitoring/</guid><description>The verb monitoring simply means &amp;ldquo;observing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;checking&amp;rdquo;. In our case, it means that you hear the sound you&amp;rsquo;re producing.</description></item><item><title>Controls: Overview</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/controls-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/controls-overview/</guid><description>You have a DAW and know how to use it. You have your new project open. You have some way to monitor what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, a workflow for listening and improving.</description></item><item><title>Timing</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/timing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/timing/</guid><description>This one might seem obvious. Place audio files where they should start, right? Well, if you have audio files that all use the same rhythm perfectly, it is simple to get timing right.</description></item><item><title>Volume</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/volume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/volume/</guid><description>Volume is often called &amp;ldquo;gain&amp;rdquo;. I, and many others, might use the terms interchangeably. But their meaning remains the same: how loud a track will be played.</description></item><item><title>Panning</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/panning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/panning/</guid><description>Panning is the control that makes the difference between Mono and Stereo sound. By default, every track is panned to center (C).</description></item><item><title>Automation</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/automation/</guid><description>Automation. The magical sauce that nobody wants to use when they just start out. The practical tip that everybody ignores until they realize it&amp;rsquo;s the truth.</description></item><item><title>Effects: Overview</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/effects-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/effects-overview/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re ready for the second holy trinity of mixing: Effects. This is, again, a short chapter to take a breather and indicate we&amp;rsquo;re moving to a new section.</description></item><item><title>Compression</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/compression/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/compression/</guid><description>Every recording has a certain dynamic range. That&amp;rsquo;s the range between the lowest volume and the highest volume. Changes in volume are, therefore, also often called dynamics.</description></item><item><title>Equalizer (EQ)</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/equalizer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/equalizer/</guid><description>In a way, last chapter (about compression) was about the equalizer of volume. The compressor reduces the range from the lowest to highest volume, making the recording a little more equal in terms of power.</description></item><item><title>Reverb &amp; Delay</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/reverb-and-delay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/reverb-and-delay/</guid><description>Delay and Reverb are related effects. But they&amp;rsquo;re certainly not the same or interchangeable. After many failed attempts at using it, I finally learned the one true lesson!</description></item><item><title>Vocals</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/vocals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/vocals/</guid><description>Numerous times, I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that vocals are the most important element in a mix (that has lyrics). It&amp;rsquo;s the loudest one.</description></item><item><title>Distortion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/distortion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/distortion/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of this course. This chapter wasn&amp;rsquo;t included, at first. But as I went through all my old projects to find clips for my examples, I realized this principle was too important to leave out.</description></item><item><title>Mastering</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/mastering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/mastering/</guid><description>Some people call &amp;ldquo;mastering&amp;rdquo; an entirely different skill than &amp;ldquo;mixing&amp;rdquo;. I think that&amp;rsquo;s extreme. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s just one part of the mixing toolset.</description></item><item><title>Conclusion</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/conclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/conclusion/</guid><description>Congratulations! You&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end of the course on mixing! I&amp;rsquo;ve taught and shown you every single useful idea and practical tip I could think of.</description></item><item><title>The EQ Cheat Sheet</title><link>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-eq-cheat-sheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-eq-cheat-sheet/</guid><description>Below is an image showing which frequencies instruments use, or what general sound we associate with frequency ranges.
