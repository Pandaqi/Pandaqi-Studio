The compressor reduces the range from the lowest to highest volume, making the recording a little more equal in terms of power.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the next step after volume? What else can you equalize? <strong>Pitch</strong>, or <strong>frequencies</strong>.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s a subtle difference. A reason why we call this the <em>equalizer</em> (or &ldquo;EQ&rdquo;). The point of this plugin is <strong>not</strong> to compress the range of frequencies: to make the recording produce a smaller range of frequencies. That&rsquo;d be pointless, to reduce every recording to only one pitch :p</p><p>No, the name is a leftover from the original purpose of this plugin. Old audio equipment was terrible at reproducing sounds. It often included all sorts of frequencies that shouldn&rsquo;t be there, while making the crucial frequencies inaudible. As such, the &ldquo;equalizer&rdquo; was meant to &ldquo;equalize&rdquo; all the different frequencies in volume. To compensate for wild frequencies: those that were too loud or too soft.</p><p>In the modern day, we often use it more subtly and for more specific purposes.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Let&rsquo;s say you record a guitar. At first, everything seems fine. But then you double the guitar, or maybe even quadruple it. Once all four guitars are playing &mldr; you notice there&rsquo;s way too much low end. You barely hear the higher frequencies, the high strings, the &ldquo;shimmer&rdquo; a guitar gives. Instead, you only hear low rumble and strumming.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when you grab your equalizer! Find the low frequencies that are too loud&mdash;reduce them. Find the high frequencies you miss&mdash;boost them.</p></div><p>I discuss these effects in order of importance and how they are generally applied. Often, you&rsquo;ll compress a track first (if needed), and then add the EQ (if needed).</p><h2 id=how-does-it-work>How does it work?</h2><p>Older equalizers had a clear limit on what they could do. They only gave you a few &ldquo;bands&rdquo;, a few &ldquo;ranges of frequencies&rdquo;, which you could control. Usually, these were,</p><ul><li>Low (LF)</li><li>Low-Mid (LMF)</li><li>Mid (MF)</li><li>High-Mid (HMF)</li><li>High (HF)</li></ul><p>You could boost or dampen the volume of each area (individually).</p><p>Today, there&rsquo;s no such limit. You can add as many bands you want. You can boost loads of specific frequencies. Software is unlimited!</p><p>But &mldr; I don&rsquo;t recommend that. I think the old limited approach is helpful. It&rsquo;s easier to make decisions, it simplifies equalizing. And those five bands is really all you need.</p><p>When you hear a problem, you don&rsquo;t think: &ldquo;man, the 127 Hz on this track is killing me!&rdquo; You think &ldquo;hmm that sounds like too many <em>low</em> frequencies, let&rsquo;s cut some of that&rdquo;.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The true enemy of getting stuff done is <em>doubt</em> and <em>too many options</em>. Restricting yourself in ways like these, during creative processes, is often extremely helpful.</p></div><h2 id=other-properties>Other properties</h2><p>Okay, so you can pick a <em>frequency</em> and how much you want to <em>change its volume</em>.</p><p>As you know by now, however, changes to audio should always happen smoothly. So you&rsquo;re not changing one frequency, you&rsquo;re changing a <em>range</em> of frequencies. The plugin draws a smooth curve around the frequency you chose and also changes those near it.</p><p>This is controlled by the <strong>Q</strong>. A higher Q, means a more narrow (and less smooth) range. If you boost the frequency 100 Hz,</p><ul><li>A <strong>low</strong> Q might also nudge the frequencies 50 Hz-150 Hz in that direction</li><li>While a <strong>high</strong> Q would only touch the 90 Hz-110 Hz frequencies.</li></ul><p>Boosting or cutting frequencies changes the overall volume. Hence, most equalizers have a <strong>gain</strong> knob. Just like with the compressor, use it to keep the average volume consistent (even after changes).</p><p>Play around with the example below. Increase / decrease a frequency range (significantly) and hear what it does with the sound. Try to make the guitar sound fuller, or more &ldquo;in your face&rdquo;, or more far away. If you don&rsquo;t like a part of the sound, try to cut it away.</p><p>The equalizer probably has the most knobs and sliders of all effects. Don&rsquo;t worry if it feels like a lot. Just <em>play</em> with it. Nothing can go wrong, and it trains your ears.</p><figure class="pq-daw-wrapper no-hover" data-tempo=120 data-duration=17 data-caption><div class=daw-tracks><div class=pq-daw-track data-id=Guitar data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects=equalizer data-out=master data-show data-hide data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=../automation/hey_miss_guitar data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div></div></figure><p>Some EQ plugins allow enabling/disabling your bands quickly. If yours does that, don&rsquo;t forget to turn <em>on</em> the band you want to use. This is a great way to check if your changes are actually working. Listen to your song with and without the change.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Although, honestly, it takes a lot of experience to even know what you&rsquo;re looking for. When I first got this advice, it was pretty useless to me. Because I was like: &ldquo;eh it sounds different &mldr; but is it better? I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p></div><h2 id=filters>Filters</h2><p>Most EQ plugins also have shortcut buttons for two crucial types of filters</p><ul><li>High-Pass Filter (or Low Cut)</li><li>Low-Pass Filter (or High Cut)</li></ul><p>Their name says it all. The High-Pass filter only lets <em>high frequencies through</em>. The Low-Pass filter only lets <em>low frequencies through</em>.</p><p>Most recordings contain rumble in the low end that you don&rsquo;t need. (It provides nothing for the song, it&rsquo;s just noise, people barely hear it anyway.) A High-Pass filter sweeps that away.</p><p>Similarly, many reverb plugins sound terrible when you feed a full signal into them. Instead, people recommend cutting away the low and high end beforehand, so you only send the crucial midrange frequencies to the reverb.</p><p>You can also achieve this by manually doing the setup. The filters are just a very common tool and therefore usually have their own button / shortcut.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Many microphones have built-in High-Pass filters. That&rsquo;s how common the issue is. It also means, though, that most recordings you get will already have been filtered. So there&rsquo;s no need to do it yourself. As always, don&rsquo;t apply EQ to all tracks by default. Only reach for EQ if you <em>hear</em> a specific problem frequency.</p></div><h2 id=when-do-i-use-it>When do I use it?</h2><p>Either to fix issues within a track itself, or to fix issues <em>between</em> tracks.</p><h3 id=within-a-track>Within a track</h3><p>Take my earlier example. A recording of a guitar might have too many low frequencies, or a singer might sing with way too much &ldquo;sibilance&rdquo; (high frequencies created on plosives like &ldquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;p&rdquo;). You hear this problem frequency, you cut it away with EQ.</p><p>This takes a trained ear. At first, you might only hear that &ldquo;something is wrong&rdquo;, but don&rsquo;t know which exact frequency it is. If so, experiment! Create a big boosting band (so you basically only hear one range of frequencies from this track). Sweep it left to right. When you hear the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; getting <em>worse</em>&mdash;you&rsquo;ve found the frequencies responsible for it!</p><h3 id=between-tracks>Between tracks</h3><p>Even if tracks sound great on their own, they might not sound great when combined. If all your recordings have the same focus on midrange frequencies, this will become a major problem when combined. Your whole mix will sound like midrange! The other frequencies are nowhere to be found!</p><p>Instead, remember the 3D space of mixing. Each instrument should have its own space. That also means they get their own frequency range in which they shine.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>Guitars are midrange instruments. They are loudest in those frequencies. Their characteristic sound comes from those frequencies. So if you add guitars, let them keep their midrange, but <em>cut</em> it away from other instruments that have those frequencies.</p></div><h3 id=pink-noise-check-again>Pink Noise Check (again)</h3><p>Remember my talk about pink noise in the <a href=../volume/>Volume</a> chapter?</p><p>It obviously applies here as well! Most good mixes will resemble a pink noise curve when done. (When you play the whole thing, all tracks combined. Tracks on their own do not necessarily look like it.)</p><p>This is an easy, safe check. Place an equalizer on your master track and check the frequencies. If it doesn&rsquo;t look like pink noise, you want to investigate the frequencies that are missing (or too abundant).</p><h3 id=general-usage>General usage</h3><p>Earlier I talked about &ldquo;volume creep&rdquo;. The same is true for &ldquo;frequency creep&rdquo;. Instead of <em>boosting</em> frequencies you hear too little, it&rsquo;s often better to <em>lower</em> frequencies you hear too much. By doing that, the nice frequencies automatically appear (by contrast). And you never run into that ceiling of &ldquo;maximum volume on all frequencies&rdquo; after which you can&rsquo;t do any more mixing!</p><p>The summary? Prefer cutting bad frequencies over boosting good ones.</p><h2 id=practical-tips>Practical Tips</h2><p>I&rsquo;ll only give one here.</p><ul><li>When you <strong>boost</strong> frequencies, use a low <strong>Q</strong> (the boost area is wide and smooth)</li><li>When you <strong>cut</strong> frequencies, use a high <strong>Q</strong> (the cut area is narrow and precise)</li></ul><p>I have many more tips. So many, in fact, that they didn&rsquo;t fit in this chapter. It&rsquo;s a long list of <em>which frequencies matter per instrument</em> and <em>how to handle the different ranges</em>.</p><p>I decided to move it to a sort of &ldquo;appendix&rdquo;. If you want to read it now, check <a href=../the-eq-cheat-sheet/>EQ Cheat Sheet</a>. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll find it at the end of the course, after the conclusion.</p></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/compression/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>Compression</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/reverb-and-delay/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Reverb & Delay</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
