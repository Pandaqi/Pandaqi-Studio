Place audio files where they should start, right? Well, if you have audio files that all use the same rhythm perfectly, it <em>is</em> simple to get timing right.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s usually not the case. What if the audio goes on for too long? What if the timing is slightly off, can we fix that with editing? Can the DAW help me prevent mistakes with timing or tempo? Are there any &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; to make a track more groovy or more rhythmic?</p><p>This chapter tries to give some answers.</p><h2 id=tempo-in-a-daw>Tempo in a DAW</h2><p>Most DAWs ask you to set one tempo for your project when you create it. You can always change it later&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not recommended. Because, what should it do with your existing audio files? Keep them the same? Change them to match the new tempo? It&rsquo;s highly likely that changing tempo later will create issues.</p><p>Why set a tempo at all? Three reasons.</p><p><strong>Generally helpful:</strong> the DAW will help you, every step of the way, to stay <em>true</em> to that tempo! The software will draw vertical lines for all the beats. Often, it will also <em>snap</em> tracks to those lines (or it&rsquo;s an option you can turn on).</p><p>By following this guideline, you can be certain that all your tracks neatly follow the same tempo.</p><p><strong>Metronome:</strong> every DAW also has a <em>metronome</em> you can turn on. This can help to check your timing. It&rsquo;s also incredibly useful if you need to do more recordings (for this project), which you obviously want to be in the same exact tempo.</p><p><strong>Quantizing:</strong> if your recording ends up with some timing mistakes, you can <em>quantize</em> it. The DAW snaps the notes to the closest beat in its grid. This is incredibly helpful, but does <em>not</em> perform magic! If your timing is off by too much, it will snap notes the wrong way. Quantizing MIDI tracks is fine, but quantizing audio will quickly introduce &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t sound great.</p><p>The best thing&mdash;as always&mdash;is to ensure all your <em>recordings</em> have perfect tempo. Trying to fix it during mixing is fighting an uphill battle.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of helpful beat/tempo marks in DAW + quantizing.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=quantizing.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of helpful beat/tempo marks in DAW + quantizing." title="Visualization of helpful beat/tempo marks in DAW + quantizing." width=855 height=324></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>You might think you don&rsquo;t need a metronome. You might think you have a strong feeling for rhythm and know what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re probably wrong :p I fell into this trap big time. Until you play and mix to an unyielding metronome for a few weeks, you don&rsquo;t know how bad your sense of timing can be.</p></div><h2 id=timing-in-a-daw>Timing in a DAW</h2><p>This part is simple. All DAWs support moving a track around by <em>dragging</em> it. This is how you determine when it starts.</p><p>Additionally, you can choose to only use a <em>part</em> of a recording. You can drag the <em>start</em> or <em>end</em> of the rectangle to select which part to play.</p><p>If you want finer control, you always have a <em>cutting tool</em>. You click somewhere in that rectangle, and it&rsquo;s <em>cut</em> in two at that point. You can do this as much as you want. Remember, however, that the human ear hears sound as a continuum. If it suddenly stops or changes, that sounds bad to us. If you cut a vocal take to add some silence, so it matches the tempo better, that <em>will</em> sound bad. Because the sound doesn&rsquo;t continue naturally.</p><p>Cutting should be done with care, and I&rsquo;ll explain some tips below.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>The biggest usage of cutting like a madman happens with pop vocals. Often, they do <em>many</em> takes and then pick the best parts of each one. So the final vocal might be the result of twenty tiny slices of other recordings.</p><p>Why do they get away with this? Our voice is <em>most suited</em> to cutting. Because we can instantly start or stop a sound. Additionally, pop vocals are heavily processed and usually have many layers, so imperfections are hidden.</p></div><p>In general, you want one recording at a time on a track. If you want to play multiple recordings simultaneously, you use multiple tracks for that. (Not surprising, I hope.)</p><p>Most software, however, <em>does</em> support placing multiple (overlapping) recordings on the same track. It either places the last-placed one, or all of them.</p><p>Why? What&rsquo;s the point?</p><p>To allow <strong>nice transitions</strong> between the different parts, using <em>cross fading</em>.</p><h2 id=transitions-are-everything>Transitions are everything</h2><p>Transitions are the key to getting this control right. It&rsquo;s not hard to place audio when it should play, and to remove the parts that shouldn&rsquo;t play.</p><p>What&rsquo;s harder is to <em>blend</em> all those different recordings together. To transition nicely from one recording of the guitar (let&rsquo;s say the <em>verse</em>) to another (the <em>chorus</em>).</p><p>It usually doesn&rsquo;t work if you just stitch recordings together on a track. One recording will suddenly <em>stop</em>, then a completely different sound <em>starts</em>. It&rsquo;s not natural and it doesn&rsquo;t sound nice.</p><p>Instead,</p><ul><li>Make the first end slightly later (so it overlaps with the start of the recording after it)</li><li>Make the second start slightly earlier (so it overlaps with the end of the recording before it)</li></ul><p>Now you can select both tracks and apply a &ldquo;fade&rdquo; or &ldquo;cross fade&rdquo;. (This depends on your DAW. Some do it automatically when they see you overlap tracks.)</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>For the same reason, apply fades to the start/end of <em>all audio files</em>. Some DAWs do this automatically. Otherwise, it should be a quick shortcut. Having audio start or stop out of nowhere often creates nasty side effects.</p></div><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of smooth transitions and (cross) fading</span></figcaption><picture><img src=crossfade_transitions.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of smooth transitions and (cross) fading" title="Visualization of smooth transitions and (cross) fading" width=855 height=249></picture></figure></p><p>When you play it back, you&rsquo;ll notice how the transition is smooth. It sounds like <em>one</em> continuous take or performance.</p><p>My interactive examples apply tiny fades to everything. Below, I&rsquo;ve turned them off by default. Hear the &ldquo;pop&rdquo; (sometimes louder, sometimes softer) when sound suddenly stops or comes in.</p><figure class="pq-daw-wrapper no-hover" data-tempo=120 data-duration=12 data-caption><div class=daw-tracks><div class=pq-daw-track data-id="Track (guitar)" data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=set_sail_guitar data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=2 data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0 data-fadeend=0></div><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=set_sail_guitar data-type=audio data-start=3 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=2.75 data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=2 data-fadestart=0 data-fadeend=0></div><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=set_sail_guitar data-type=audio data-start=7 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=2.66 data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=7.35 data-fadestart=0 data-fadeend=0></div></div></div></figure><p>Now select a part (click on it) and press <code>F</code> a few times to increase the fade, or <code>G</code> to decrease again.</p><p>The fade doesn&rsquo;t even need to be long. Most of the time, I use a very short one. In fact, if the fade takes too long, it becomes noticeable. The listener will hear an instrument magically dropping in volume for a second or so, before the new one finally kicks in.</p><p>Transitions between recordings matter. But they also matter between &ldquo;sections&rdquo; of your song. When your chorus kicks in, for example, it usually means that more tracks become active. You want that chorus to feel energetic&mdash;you want to start it with a <em>bang</em>.</p><p>The best way to <em>ruin</em> that, is by starting all the instruments at slightly different times :p Move their files around so that the transients&mdash;the peak of that first note&mdash;all line up perfectly. Otherwise, it sounds like a stutter. Like your song lost confidence and didn&rsquo;t know when to start the chorus exactly.</p><h2 id=dont-startstop-immediately>Don&rsquo;t start/stop immediately</h2><p>Maybe you tried the tip above and the DAW didn&rsquo;t let you. You couldn&rsquo;t just make a recording longer or shorter. This is a <em>recording</em> mistake I struggled with as well.</p><p>When I started, I&rsquo;d start a recording <em>and immediately started playing</em>. And when I was done? I immediately stopped. This made the recording exactly as long as it should be. Nice, right? Why record the extra bits? Why record &ldquo;silence&rdquo;?</p><p>Now you know why: for the transitions. The recording should start a few bars before you actually make sound. And when you&rsquo;re done, let the recording go on for another few bars.</p><p>This ensures the recording is long enough to overlap others and use cross fades. Without it, each recording misses a few vital milliseconds at the start and end. They sound robotic and sudden, hard to mix.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the <em>original</em> (full, raw, unedited) recording of that guitar. Notice the empty space at the start/end, and how I play a little beyond that.</p><figure class="pq-daw-wrapper no-hover" data-tempo=120 data-duration=17 data-caption><div class=daw-tracks><div class=pq-daw-track data-id="Track (guitar)" data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=0 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=set_sail_guitar_full data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div></div></figure><h2 id=dont-explode-your-number-of-tracks>Don&rsquo;t explode your number of tracks</h2><p>Like most, my first mixes were filled to the brim with tracks. Surely, I needed 10 instruments for the chorus! I needed a regular vocal, a high one, a low one, and some more!</p><p>Now I know that a multitude of tracks actually makes a mix sound <em>smaller</em>. It&rsquo;s like you filled a container until it was <em>full</em>, leaving no space. It&rsquo;s better to take that same container and only fill it with a handful of important elements. This leaves space around the elements to make them stand out, to make the mix sound <em>big</em> and <em>wide</em>.</p><p>Instead, use the <em>number of tracks</em> to clearly indicate how powerful a section of the song should be.</p><p>A soft, first verse should only have a few tracks playing. In fact, many (pop) songs get away with just a vocal and a piano. Sometimes they start with only that vocal.</p><p>The final chorus can have five times as many layers at once. That <em>contrast</em>, that difference, is what makes the chorus powerful and the verse intimate. If both parts have twenty tracks playing simultaneously, they&rsquo;ll both sound same-y (and overly full).</p><h2 id=tricks>Tricks</h2><h3 id=the-drop>The drop</h3><p>This is especially popular in dance or rock tracks. All of a sudden, the whole song just <em>stops</em>. Tracks are cut off. No tracks are played for a fraction of a second, leading to total silence.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a <em>great</em> trick to emphasize rhythm and timing.</p><p>Why? Because of that silence, what comes <em>after</em> it is enhanced. During that silence, our body <em>longs</em> to hear the next strong beat, to continue the song. Wait until we can&rsquo;t take it anymore&mdash;then bring back the music.</p><p>Contrast is key in music, like in most creative disciplines. Your song might have a great rhythm, but if it&rsquo;s <em>the same</em> for the whole song &mldr; it will still feel boring after 30 seconds. Use the drop, the sudden stop of everything, to play with timing.</p><h3 id=changing-tempo>Changing tempo</h3><p>Another way to play with timing, is to obviously <em>change the timing</em>. All DAWs will allow you to change tempo mid-song. In fact, it&rsquo;s a sneaky common practice.</p><p>Most songs crank up their tempo&mdash;by just a few BPM&mdash;during the chorus or bridge. You don&rsquo;t <em>consciously</em> notice it as the listener. But you do notice it, because you think &ldquo;wow that chorus is <em>nice</em>!&rdquo;</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>&ldquo;Rolling in the Deep&rdquo; by Adele does this. A slight increase in tempo in the chorus. I once saw an interview with the producer, where they explicitly stated they tempo mapped the song that way from the start.</p></div><p>Now, remember what I said at the start of this chapter. Changing tempo afterwards is possible, but unlikely to sound great.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why famous producers usually &ldquo;tempo map&rdquo; their song beforehand. Before they do any <em>recording</em>, they know exactly what the tempo should be for every section. And so, they record it in the right tempo from the start, removing any need to do this during mixing.</p><h3 id=delay-the-bad-way>Delay (the bad way)</h3><p>A cheap &ldquo;trick&rdquo; to make a sound wider, as if it&rsquo;s 3D, is to play the recording twice but <em>delayed</em>. So copy the recording to a second track, then move it to start <em>slightly</em> later. Listening in stereo, certainly on headphones, this sounds amazing. (This is often called the &ldquo;Haas effect&rdquo;.)</p><p>However &mldr; if you listen in mono, it will sound horrible! The two sounds are fighting each other!</p><p>Try it. First, listen to the stereo sound. Quite nice, right? Then move the pan slider so both sounds are in the center, effectively making it mono.</p><figure class="pq-daw-wrapper no-hover" data-tempo=120 data-duration=17 data-caption><div class=daw-tracks><div class=pq-daw-track data-id="Track (guitarL)" data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=-100 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=set_sail_guitar_full data-type=audio data-start=0 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div><div class=pq-daw-track data-id="Track (guitarR)" data-type=regular data-solo=false data-mute=false data-pan=100 data-volume=0 data-mono=false data-phase=false data-record=false data-visible=true data-effects data-out=master data-show data-hide=effects data-master=false><div class=pq-daw-track-part data-source=set_sail_guitar_full data-type=audio data-start=0.02 data-end=NoEndTimeSpecified data-duration=NoDurationSpecified data-totalduration=NoTotalDurationKnown data-offset=0 data-fadestart=0.05 data-fadeend=0.05></div></div></div></figure><p>The sound <em>changes drastically</em> based on how somebody listens to your song. Additionally, the mono sound is a bit thin and hollow.</p><p>Thus, I <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> recommend doing this. Maybe for some background track. Maybe if you <em>want</em> that kind of sound. Otherwise, use the real ways to make something wide and stereo: panning and reverb.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The Haas effect works slightly better if you sufficiently &ldquo;change&rdquo; both tracks. Destroy them a bit with effects, cutting, etcetera, until they are so different that they don&rsquo;t fight each other anymore. But even that is a band aid solution.</p></div><h3 id=surprise>Surprise</h3><p>In my course on songwriting, I talked about strong and weak beats (see <a href=../../songwriting/rhythm-i>Rhythm</a>). Mixing has quite some overlap with songwriting in general. In both cases, you try to arrange the parts of a song to work together as well as possible. (So I highly recommend checking out that course as well.)</p><p>The summary? The beats at the start and middle of each measure are &ldquo;strong&rdquo;. The others are &ldquo;weak&rdquo;.</p><p>A good rhythm will allow many notes to fall on those strong beats. We expect that. Without it, we can&rsquo;t pinpoint what the timing of the song even <em>is</em>.</p><p>But that means <em>breaking</em> the rule is what adds surprise and excitement. Once in a while, start something on a weak beat (&ldquo;off-beat&rdquo;). This can be an instrument, a longer recording, or just a tiny snippet of sound (&ldquo;ear candy&rdquo;).</p><p>Balance that. Have most tracks neatly lined up, starting at the strongest beats. Then add surprising off-beat elements as the special sauce.</p><p>The example below shows a simple melody. It starts in a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; rhythm. This is important, as you can only add &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; if there is some predictable pattern to begin with! But it&rsquo;s also kind of boring. So once it has established itself, it jumps around and does some surprising things.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><div class=midi-data data-tempo=240 data-time=4/4 data-strict=true data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=traditional data-transpose data-metronome=true style=display:none>C3/2 B2/2 | C3/2 R/2 | C3/2 B2/4.

He left in a laugh somewhere. There&rsquo;s a whole melody line that only plays for <em>one tiny part</em> of the song. All his instruments are on key, which means nobody noticed how one instrument just played entirely the wrong note somewhere :p</p></div><h3 id=staggering>Staggering</h3><p>Finally, an easy way to enhance timing or rhythm, is by <em>repetition</em>. Either exact repetition, or one that follows a pattern (like going slower or faster over time).</p><p>Want to end the song? Repeat the same chord or note, slower, and slower, and slower &mldr; until the song is so slow that you can end it.</p><p>Want to build a strong transition to the chorus? Repeat a certain note faster, and faster, and faster &mldr; until it &ldquo;explodes&rdquo; into the chorus.</p><p>Or maybe you have a slow section in the song. One with so little instrumentation or vocals that listeners might lose the rhythm. Add a simple repeating sound (could be a drum, could be a high chime, could be near inaudible) on the strong beats to keep the timing &ldquo;alive&rdquo;.</p><p>See the example below. Very simple timing, but it feels <em>annoying</em> when the sample stops at the end :p Because we&rsquo;ve build up and you now want that tension released by exploding into a new section of the song.</p><figure class="midi-player no-hover"><figcaption class=side-note><span>A very simple example of building to something with timing</span></figcaption><div class=midi-data data-tempo=240 data-time=4/4 data-strict=true data-pitchinput=absolute data-timeinput=traditional data-transpose data-metronome=true style=display:none>:E3/1 | R/2 D3/4 F3/2 E3/2 G3/2 F3/4 F3/8 G3/8 A3/8 B3/8 |
