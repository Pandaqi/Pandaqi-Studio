That one focuses more on details and examples related to <em>recording</em>. In this one, I shift the focus to what this concept means for <em>mixing</em>.</p><p>What is the (ominously named) <strong>disconnect</strong>?</p><p>It&rsquo;s why mixing seems so hard and intuitive. It&rsquo;s because &mldr;</p><blockquote><p>How our <em>ears</em> work, is not how <em>microphones</em> and <em>speakers</em> work.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s because our ears are used to the real world, to hearing sounds in a physical space. We can easily tell where the sound is, how far away, in what kind of room we are (based on the reverb). Even if it&rsquo;s very soft or it comes from behind.</p><p>When you record something, and turn it into digital files, it&rsquo;s like entering an entirely new world. You don&rsquo;t have the laws of physics anymore. Your computer or microphone is not as amazing as your ears. Instead, it&rsquo;s your <em>job</em> as an audio engineer to make those &ldquo;bad&rdquo; recordings sound like the real world <em>as much as possible</em>. Using tools, tricks and techniques.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go over the most important differences. And why every digital recording will sound worse than the live sound (barring lucky exceptions).</p><h2 id=mono--stereo>Mono / Stereo</h2><p>We have <em>two</em> ears. This means we hear a sound two times, but slightly differently. It enters the other ear a millisecond later. The other ear points to the <em>other side</em>, so it picks up a slightly different range of sounds.</p><p>Our brain performs a magical process: it combines these two inputs into one that sounds <em>great</em>. If you listen to a live piano, you&rsquo;re actually hearing two different things (one input from each ear), but your brain is smart enough to combine them. Into <em>one</em> sound that is <em>realistic</em>: it sounds 3D and you know where it comes from.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>The same is true for headphones, of course. We don&rsquo;t consciously hear the <em>two different earbuds</em>. Instead, in our head, we hear <em>one</em> song, which is roughly &ldquo;centered&rdquo; in our mind.</p></div><p>This is called <strong>stereo</strong>: two channels. We understand and hear sound in <em>stereo</em>.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s say you place a single microphone to record a guitar. That&rsquo;s a <em>single</em> source, which we call <strong>mono</strong>. How could it ever capture the sound we hear with our ears?</p><p>It can&rsquo;t.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s just one channel.</p><p>Even the best microphone, placed in the best possible way, will not sound as good (and &ldquo;3D&rdquo;) as our ears. Not by default. It&rsquo;s your job, as audio engineer, to <em>turn</em> that recording into something our ears like more.</p><p>More on this in the chapter about <a href=../panning/>Panning</a>. That&rsquo;s the tool every DAW provides for placing tracks more to the left ear or right ear.</p><h2 id=proximity>Proximity</h2><p>Again, our ears are amazing, microphones struggle to replicate it.</p><p>Most microphones have the <em>proximity</em> effect. The closer you get, the more it captures <em>low frequencies</em> (instead of giving a balanced image). Similarly, if you get further away, it will capture more of the <em>high frequencies</em>.</p><p>As such, a recording might not sound entirely like the sound you want. It has captured the sound &mldr; but twisted it in a way.</p><p>Similarly, microphones only hear in a very short range <em>and</em> distort sound heard from the side. If your source (like a singer) moves around, even a tiny bit, that can cause drastic changes in volume or frequency content. One moment the recording is loud, the next you can barely hear the singer.</p><p>Our ears would not struggle with this at all. But a microphone picks up all these small changes and modifies the final recording.</p><p>It&rsquo;s best to <em>prevent</em> this during the recording stage, of course. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s your job to find these quirks and combat them.</p><p>More on this in the chapters about <a href=../compression/>Compression</a> and <a href=../equalizer/>Equalizer</a>.</p><h2 id=reverb>Reverb</h2><p>Audio <em>bounces around</em>. An audio source produces sound in all directions. Then, these waves travel in straight lines until they hit something and get deflected. (Like throwing a ball against a wall.)</p><p>Every deflection, they get softer and higher. But some of those reflections&mdash;quite many, in fact&mdash;will reach your ears again.</p><p>This is <em>reverb</em>. The sound <em>reverberates</em> off the room or the objects around you.</p><p>This reverb helps us immensely. It allows us to place sounds in 3D. If the reverb comes back very quick, we&rsquo;re in a tiny room. If the reverb is massive, we&rsquo;re in a large reflective room with a large ceiling&mdash;like a church or cathedral.</p><p>When you record something, you not only get the original sound, you also get all that reverb!</p><p>On its own, this might sound great and realistic.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Although, because of the limitations of microphones, this can already sound terrible. The original sound clashes with the reverb and makes the recording worse.</p></div><p>But almost all projects have more than one recording. In fact, they have many recordings played simultaneously.</p><p>In real life, the reverb from these instruments would mix into something nice and realistic.</p><p>But with digital recordings? Made in different locations or at different times? They all have a different reverb, and they&rsquo;ll all but heads, creating an ugly washed-out song.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why you need recordings that are very &ldquo;dry&rdquo;. They were recorded in a good way, or a good (acoustically treated) space, to reduce that reverb.</p><p>Dry recordings usually don&rsquo;t sound great on their own. Because our ears want that reverb! It sounds unrealistic and dull!</p><p>But because they are &ldquo;dry&rdquo;, you can combine and edit recordings easily. And you can add effects <em>later</em> to get that reverb back&mdash;in a good way.</p><p>More on that later in the chapter <a href=../reverb-and-delay/>Reverb & Delay</a>.</p><h2 id=our-ears-adapt>Our ears adapt</h2><p>Our ears are living organs. They are connected to our brain, which is, you know, <em>smart</em>. Through a lifetime of experience with sounds, they are able to adapt.</p><p>Annoying sounds get filtered out. If somebody speaks unclearly, we focus more on them to hear them better. A constant or repeating sound will also be completely ignored after a while. When a sound is too <em>loud</em>, our ears go into self-protection and will reduce their sensitivity to all input.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I live right next to a busy road. A worn-down road that really should <em>not</em> be used by heavy trucks&mdash;but of course they do. I am able to sleep through loud, jarring noise just fine. My ears filter it out for me. But sometimes I wake up early, for some reason, and hear the day start and the first trucks come in. Then I realize just how incredibly noisy it is. Once I focus on it, consciously, I can&rsquo;t filter it out and get blasted with truck noise.</p></div><p>Microphones can&rsquo;t do this, of course not. Another reason for the disconnect.</p><p>But it also means that it&rsquo;s hard to stay <em>objective</em> when listening to our own mixes. After hearing the same section for a while, you don&rsquo;t actually listen to it anymore. You know it by heart. Your ears have adjusted. So you simply <em>can&rsquo;t</em> make well-informed mixing decisions anymore.</p><p>Your song might sound terrible. But you&rsquo;ll only hear that during the first five seconds! Beyond that, your ears have now adjusted and don&rsquo;t mind the terrible audio quality anymore.</p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>This is obviously also a benefit, as potential listeners will do the same. Most likely, though, they turn off your song within those ugly first five seconds.</p></div><p>The only way to stay objective, is to &mldr;</p><ul><li>Switch between different sections / instruments / songs regularly</li><li>Alternate between doing your mixing and just listening to the radio or your playlist</li><li>Take many breaks</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Grinding&rdquo; is never great. But especially in music production, forcing yourself to sit down for hours and &ldquo;get that track done&rdquo; is completely counterproductive. After 30-60 minutes (at most) your ears will either think everything you do sounds like shit or sounds like god composed it himself&mdash;and both opinions are wrong.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/introduction/ class="masked big-mask mask-2"><span class=container>Introduction</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-disconnect-ii-how-audio-works/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>The Disconnect II: Sound Waves</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
