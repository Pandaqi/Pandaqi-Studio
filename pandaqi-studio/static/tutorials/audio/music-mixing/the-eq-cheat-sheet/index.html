What are the general properties of each range? When would you boost or cut a specific range?</p><p>The overview below is generally true. But as always, there are no &ldquo;rules&rdquo; in music.</p><h3 id=50--60-hz>50&ndash;60 Hz</h3><p>The absolute lowest frequencies that mean something.</p><ul><li>Essential to kick drum and low (booming) bassline.</li><li>Mostly critical in dubstep and reggae</li><li>If used too much, you&rsquo;ll mostly hear (and surely feel) the bass and not much else</li><li>If used too little, a song will not have enough depth or weight. It misses the fundamental root notes.</li></ul><h3 id=100--200-hz>100&ndash;200 Hz</h3><p>The low midrange. Near the frequencies most common in instruments. The average frequency of the male voice.</p><ul><li>Essential to snare</li><li>Adds a certain richness or warmth to most instruments</li><li>If used too much, things will sound muddy, too much of the same and dull</li><li>If used too little, the sound is thin and cold</li></ul><h3 id=200-500-hz>200-500 Hz</h3><p>The midrange. The most common frequencies. The low end of this is the average frequency of the female voice.</p><p><em>Why mention that?</em> Because our ears are most attuned to human voices. Those ranges are the most important to get right. It&rsquo;s what we listen for the most. As a consequence, any deviation in it, will sound unnatural.</p><ul><li>Essential in guitars, piano and vocals for warmth and weight</li><li>If used too much, things will sound muddy again and like your stuffing too much into a single mix</li><li>If used too little, the sound is thin and weak</li></ul><h3 id=500--1000-hz>500&ndash;1000 Hz</h3><p>A difficult range to work with. No clear purpose or instrument that needs it. But it still needs <em>some</em> content.</p><ul><li>Creates some weight, body and tone&mdash;but is not essential for any of them</li><li>If used too much, instruments sound pale or hollow</li><li>If used too little, the sound is thin and harsh, without a place</li></ul><h3 id=1--2-khz>1&ndash;2 kHz</h3><p>The high midrange. Adds aggression, urgency and loud clarity. This is where the &ldquo;presence&rdquo; of the human voice often resides. If used too little, the sound is warm and even &mldr; but also dull and more like background noise.</p><ul><li>Adds aggression, urgency and loud clarity</li><li>Gives some crunch, edge or punch to (electric) guitars and vocals</li><li>If used too much, your mix will be overaggressive and painful for the ears</li><li>If used too little, your mix will sound like it is muted, way too soft or lacking of life</li></ul><h3 id=5--10-khz>5&ndash;10 kHz</h3><p>Now we&rsquo;re entering the high frequencies. These add space, clarity, definition. Cheap microphones usually miss these frequencies entirely on their recording.</p><ul><li>Important for the higher parts of a drum kit, especially the very important snare</li><li>Creates clarity, a sense of freshness and freedom, and life</li><li>If used too much, your mix will sounds like it is grinding or scratching</li><li>If used too little, your mix will lack any energy, importance or presence</li></ul><h3 id=10-16-khz>10-16 kHz</h3><p>Very high, nearing the limit of our hearing capabilities. This means this often <em>lacks</em> on (poor) recordings, while you can actually add <em>a lot</em> of these frequencies without destroying a mix. That&rsquo;s what many pop tracks do.</p><ul><li>Adds areal, sparkling, spacy, heavenly sounds. A sort of &ldquo;shimmer&rdquo;</li><li>If used too much, your mix will sound artificial. Too electronic.</li><li>If used too little, the mix will sound muted, dull, muddy. Like it was forbidden to really come to life.</li></ul></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/conclusion/ class="masked big-mask mask-5"><span class=container>Conclusion</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li><span class=nav-disabled>No next page :(</span></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
