These terms are very common in the field, so it&rsquo;s good to know them. It also explains more of the disconnect&mdash;and why all DAWs use the same setup.</p><h2 id=sound-waves>Sound Waves</h2><p>Sound is a longitudinal wave. That means alternates between areas where air molecules are pressed together and areas where they are spaced out. Our ears interpret these <em>differences in pressure</em> as sound.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s hard to visualize. So the standard visualization is that of a (sine) wave. But it means the same: imagine the peaks are &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; and the valleys are &ldquo;stretched&rdquo;.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of a sound wave.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=sound_waves.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of a sound wave." title="Visualization of a sound wave." width=868 height=383></picture></figure></p><p><strong>Amplitude</strong> determines volume. Greater amplitude = louder. This is simply the highest peak (the point with the largest distance to that center line).</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> determines pitch. How high or low the sound is.</p><h2 id=about-loudness>About loudness</h2><p>We measure volume in <strong>decibels</strong> (dB). But that&rsquo;s not a linear scale, like most scales. Instead, it&rsquo;s defined as</p><ul><li><code>+3 dB</code> means that the power of the wave is multiplied by 2</li><li><code>+10 dB</code> means the power of the wave is multiplied by 10</li></ul><p><em>Power of the sound wave?</em> A wave transports energy. The power of a wave is the amount of Joules it transfers per second. Every sound therefore has a different perceived loudness based on its power (<code>W</code>).</p><p>The formula is:</p><blockquote><p>Power = log( W ) - 12</p></blockquote><p>The take away? You can&rsquo;t easily relate a change in decibels to a change in loudness. Going from <code>10 dB</code> to <code>20 dB</code> does <em>not</em> mean going twice as loud. That&rsquo;s why decibels are as strange as they are: there&rsquo;s no better system, because volume doesn&rsquo;t scale like a nice straight line upwards.</p><p>This means you need to let your ears do the work, not the numbers. If you&rsquo;ve been mixing for a while, you will have build an intuition for which values result in what loudness. But it&rsquo;s best to just try changes until the volume sounds right to you.</p><p>All of this feeds into the next point of &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo;. In the real world, sounds can always get <em>louder</em>. A wave can always get more power, which means bigger amplitude, which means more volume.</p><p>In the digital world, this is reversed. The wave has to be saved in memory in a number of &ldquo;bits&rdquo;. This means there&rsquo;s a clear <em>limit</em> on the maximum volume.</p><blockquote><p>In the digital world, sounds have a maximum volume and can always get <em>less loud</em>.</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s why DAWs use negative decibels. If you look at the meters you&rsquo;ll see <code>0</code> at the top. The maximum volume we can store, or your system can reproduce, is the zero point. You can only go softer than that. So when mixing, you&rsquo;re setting tracks to values like <code>-18 dB</code> or <code>-4 dB</code>.</p><p>If you try to go over this maximum, it&rsquo;s called <strong>clipping</strong>. And it&rsquo;s bad. It distorts the sound, because the computer has to <em>throw away</em> information it can&rsquo;t store. If your recordings are the right volume, they&rsquo;ll be a rather <em>low</em> volume that leaves plenty of space. In fact, a good mix will never even be at risk of clipping, and still be quite soft when done. (That&rsquo;s when <a href=../mastering/>Mastering</a> comes in, which is the final chapter of this course.)</p><p>As such, don&rsquo;t be afraid to mix at lower volumes. Do be afraid to clip.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>What a regular volume meter looks like, with negative decibels and clipping indication.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=volumes_in_digital.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="What a regular volume meter looks like, with negative decibels and clipping indication." title="What a regular volume meter looks like, with negative decibels and clipping indication." width=855 height=401></picture></figure></p><div class=remark-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="remark masked-block"><span class=label>Remark</span><p>Don&rsquo;t take this to an extreme. When mixing, don&rsquo;t make tiny tiny changes in volume. Use big ones to really hear if it makes a difference. On the other hand, <em>never</em> throw a track or recording over that 0 line. Yes, you can technically do that, the software won&rsquo;t stop you. But it might destroy your speakers or your ears if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p></div><h2 id=about-frequency>About frequency</h2><p>Frequency is measured in <strong>Hertz</strong> (hZ). It means &ldquo;times per second&rdquo;. So a sound of 100 Hz oscillates (between peaks and valleys) a 100 times per second.</p><p>Humans can hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz, kilohertz).</p><p>But again, our ears play tricks. Frequencies are <em>also</em> not a linear scale. They are logarithmic.</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>If you increase a sound&rsquo;s pitch from 20 Hz to 40 Hz, you might feel like you just made it &ldquo;a little higher&rdquo;. But no&mdash;you actually moved it up a whole octave! In low frequencies, subtle differences have huge consequence. The higher frequencies need bigger change to see a consequence.</p></div><p>Another cause for that &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo;. Another unintuitive thing you will slowly understand as you mix more. (Although not as magically weird as the decibel scale :p)</p><p>It&rsquo;s useful to train your ears on how each frequency range sounds. So you can quickly identify and fix issues when you hear <em>that</em> range.</p><h2 id=overtones>Overtones</h2><p>The sound wave above is a pure wave. It&rsquo;s <em>one note</em> at <em>one volume</em>. But in reality &mldr; nothing is a pure wave.</p><p>First of all, because of those deflections ( = reverb), you usually hear a sound combined with other sounds.</p><p>But each sound also naturally creates <strong>overtones</strong> (or &ldquo;harmonics&rdquo;).</p><p>The original pitch, the one you consciously hear, is the &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; or &ldquo;root note&rdquo;. But it generates more sounds, which are always multiples of the original frequency, but at lower and lower volumes as you go higher.</p><p>These overtones are what make <strong>singers and instruments sound the way they do</strong>. The note &ldquo;C4&rdquo; on a piano sounds different from a guitar, or a human singer.</p><p>Why? It&rsquo;s the same note, right? Because of those overtones. The instruments (and your mouth) are <em>shaped</em> in a certain way, which <em>shapes</em> the overtones to produce the unique instrument sound. (Also called &ldquo;timbre&rdquo;)</p><p>Once you look at those <em>equalizer</em> plugins, you&rsquo;ll see this in action. The root note has a low frequency and is loudest. But looking from left to right, more frequencies keep appearing, higher and softer.</p><p><figure><figcaption class=side-note><span>Visualization of frequency spectrum. And how a single note from an instrument would usually display.</span></figcaption><picture><img src=frequency_overtones.webp loading=lazy decoding=async alt="Visualization of frequency spectrum. And how a single note from an instrument would usually display." title="Visualization of frequency spectrum. And how a single note from an instrument would usually display." width=855 height=401></picture></figure></p><p>Remember that frequency is a log scale. That&rsquo;s why many plugins that show this are somewhat misleading. In the lower frequencies, a slight change can mean a different of a whole <em>octave</em>. In the higher frequencies, even big changes have little effect. This also causes the level of detail to be lower in the lower frequencies.</p><p>When mixing, you&rsquo;re usually not changing the root notes. If your instrument was tuned, and your song well-written, all these pitches are correct and fine. Instead, you are editing those overtones&mdash;the extra frequencies added&mdash;to sound better or work better with the other layers (in the same project).</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>For example, a guitar often risks sounding muddy and boxy. Especially when a cheap guitar is recorded up-close. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the pitches is wrong or the microphone is wrong. It just means the overtones that were <em>recorded</em> don&rsquo;t produce a nice result. So people often, by default, reduce those specific frequencies to make the guitar &ldquo;shine&rdquo; in the final song.</p></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many, many reasons for the disconnect between sound in the real world, and sound when mixed. And I haven&rsquo;t even covered them all!</p><div class=example-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><div class="example masked-block"><span class=label>Example</span><p>I&rsquo;ve left the importance of hearing yourself using neutral speakers for a later chapter. The one on <a href=../monitoring/>Monitoring</a>. Because it&rsquo;s that important.</p></div><p>That&rsquo;s why music <em>mixing</em> is different from being a good musician or being able to play/record well. It&rsquo;s an entirely different skill, because of that disconnect between <em>live</em> (physical) sound and <em>recorded</em> (digitized) sound.</p><p>Of course, being a good songwriter or having a trained ear will help immensely. You&rsquo;ll already understand many concepts I&rsquo;ll explain, perhaps intuitively.</p><p>As they usually say,</p><blockquote><p>A well-written song is easy to mix, and mistakes can be fixed. A badly written song cannot be saved, not by any amount of audio engineering.</p></blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t do recordings yourself, this might take some time to accept. When somebody hands you material that&rsquo;s just terrible&mdash;a bad song, amateur recordings&mdash;there&rsquo;s only so much you can do. Even with the best tools and the most experience.</p></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-audio secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Continue with this course</div><div class="right-block style-audio secondary-style-"><div><nav class=pagination><ul><li class=nav-left><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-right></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-disconnect-i/ class="masked big-mask mask-6"><span class=container>The Disconnect I</span></a></li><li class=nav-text></li><li class=nav-right><div class=nav-arrow><div class=arrow-left></div></div><a href=/tutorials/audio/music-mixing/the-3d-space/ class="masked big-mask mask-3"><span class=container>The 3D space</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=right-pad></div></div><div class="block-container style-support secondary-style-"><div class=left-pad></div><div class=left-block>Support me and this website!</div><div class="right-block style-support secondary-style-"><div class=support-container><p class=mobile-heading>Want to support me?</p><div class=column><p>Buy one of my projects.
