## Background

Funnily enough, the very first rules I playtested for this game were almost the exact inverse of the final rules. The rules said you had to do _either_ the Movement on your tile _or_ use its rule. This was just way too slow and felt you had no control, so I switched it to being forced to do both (move + place new rule), and suddenly the game clicked.

This was the hardest game for me to turn into specific rules. Because a "reverse egg hunt", where you change rules about where eggs are placed instead of looking for them in fixed locations, is a bit of a weird and abstract concept. Which is exactly why I was curious if it could be done ;) In the end, though, I think I turned it into a simple ruleset that anyone can understand quickly.
