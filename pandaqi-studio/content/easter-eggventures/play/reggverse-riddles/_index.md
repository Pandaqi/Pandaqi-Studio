As stated, this game is part of the Easter Eggventures project. It shares the fonts, style, and origins with all other games in the project. As such, for more information, check out the [Easter Eggventures overview page](/easter-eggventures/).

Funnily enough, the very first rules I playtested for this game were almost the exact inverse of the final rules. The rules said you had to do _either_ the Movement on your tile _or_ use its rule. This was just way too slow and felt you had no control, so I switched it to being forced to do both (move + place new rule), and suddenly the game clicked.

This was the hardest game for me to turn into specific rules. Because a "reverse egg hunt", where you change rules about where eggs are placed instead of looking for them in fixed locations, is a bit of a weird and abstract concept. Which is exactly why I was curious if it could be done ;) In the end, though, I think I turned it into a simple ruleset that anyone can understand quickly.
