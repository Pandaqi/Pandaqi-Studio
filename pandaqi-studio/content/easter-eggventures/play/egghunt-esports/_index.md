## Background

This game is probably the one that worked the fastest: at the very first playtest with others. I only needed to do some minor tweaks and balancing to get the game to its final version. It's perhaps the best and most intuitive "simulation" of a real Egg Hunt out of all the games.

I still didn't put it as the first ("simplest") game, though. Although the rules _are_ simple, you have 3 different possible actions on your turn and 3 action points to use for them. And in my experience, this just takes a bit longer to grasp for people who don't regularly play board games.
