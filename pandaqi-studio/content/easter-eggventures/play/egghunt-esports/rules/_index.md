Pick any reasonable map shape. When in doubt, just create a 6x6 grid.
* Randomly place the **eggs** _facedown_ in that shape
* And place a random **obstacle tile** _faceup_ on top of each egg.

Everyone picks their color and its 2 pawns. They place one pawn _above_ the board and one pawn _besides_ it.

The game **ends** as soon as all eggs have been collected _or_ one player is left in the arena. The player with the **highest scoring eggs** wins!

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, take **3 actions**. The possible actions are ...

* **Move**: move a pawn of yours one step, to the next row or column of the map.
* **Search**: look at the egg underneath a tile. You can only check tiles that your pawns look at.
  * If another player also has a pawn pointing to that tile, you must _reveal_ it to them as well.
  * Otherwise, it's for your eyes only.
* **Collect**: collect the egg underneath your current tile.
  * Your _"current tile"_ is the one location where your two pawns (row and column) intersect.
  * You can always collect tiles with negative points.
  * Tiles with positive points, however, must be collected in order (per type). (Example: already have the Red 4? You can't collect the Red 3 anymore.)

Once you have 3(+) eggs, you can also decide to **leave** the arena. Remove your pawns and take no more turns. As soon as one player has left, the _Check_ action becomes **unavailable** to all.

Collected eggs are kept in a secret (facedown) pile before you.

Obstacle tiles may have powers or restrictions on them. Don't forget to read and apply them!

* **Score:** A special formula for how the egg scores at the end.
* **Rule:** A permanent rule that applies to you from now on.
* **Action:** An action you can take during your turn by discarding the egg.
