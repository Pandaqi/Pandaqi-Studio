As stated, this game is part of the Easter Eggventures project. It shares the fonts, style, and origins with all other games in the project. As such, for more information, check out the [Easter Eggventures overview page](/easter-eggventures/).

This game was the last one to be invented and created for the project. Coming so late, and being a hard idea to pull off, I initially put it in last place (in order of difficulty). After streamlining the idea and testing it, however, it actually became one of the easiest! 

The core rules of the game are short and consistent from start to finish. The different "restrictions" of what eggs you can place where don't need to be remembered or understood immediately to play. This matters more for how "simple" a game is than the number of rules or material, I have learned.

This is probably my favorite, because it's unique and simple, yet has the most tactical depth and puzzling turns.
