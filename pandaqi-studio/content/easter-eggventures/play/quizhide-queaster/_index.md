## Background

If you've read that main page, you know this all started with a single idea that just didn't really work. Which then, after brainstorming, turned into _five_ ideas.

Well, this game was that original idea! I tried to somehow simulate an Egg Hunt with a randomized map of rooms. The more I worked on it, though, the more I realized the true challenge of a real-life Egg Hunt can't be replicated with board games. Eggs are hard to find, and it's fun to search for, because the real world is incredibly complex and has physical limitations. In a board game, though? Can't do that.

The idea only worked after a few crucial ideas/realizations, such as adding the Dixit-like dreamy cards, and giving players individual Score Cards so it mattered _who_ found each egg.

Ironically enough, once the idea clicked, it became the simplest of them all. The rules are so short and simple that I almost considered ditching the rulebook entirely and just printing them on a few cards in the material.
