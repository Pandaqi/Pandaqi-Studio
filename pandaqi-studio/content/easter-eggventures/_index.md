This is the **overview page** of the Easter Eggventures. 

Click any of the links below to visit a specific game. They are roughly sorted by how **simple** I think they are, in terms of short rules and simple concepts to understand.

The games are all completely **unique**. They don't share material or rules, and aren't just minor variations of the same idea.

What _do_ they have in common?
* Themed around **Easter**. (Usually the idea of an egg hunt with some twists.)
* Extremely **simple rules** for easy play with family or parent-kids. (They are mostly meant as a way to spent a holiday together, possibly with non-gamers.)
* Completely playable by **printing its material PDF** and cutting the cards/tiles. (Nothing else needed.)

As always, I design the rules for the base game to be dead simple. This does mean that you should look to the variants and expansions to add more depth and challenge to the games. It's usually a good idea to start introducing those extra elements after your first few games, once everyone is familiar.

For years now, I've tried to develop a new game for major holidays to play with the family. I had never done an Easter game before, however, which is why I initially struggled. After leaving the project for a few months and coming back with fresh eyes, my brain had apparently continued thinking about this problem.

Now I had _five_ ideas for Easter games! And all of these _did_ feel promising!

I couldn't decide which one to make, so I decided to just try all of them. And, well, when I start something, I want to do it properly and finish it. So all the ideas were developed and turned into professional games.

I briefly considered sharing more material between games, but the games were too different to accomplish that. Instead, they only share parts of the visual design: fonts, color schemes, egg illustrations.

The font used is **Gargle** (both body and heading text), freely available online. Some generative AI was used for complex illustrations, everything else is entirely mine.

For more information, as always, read my [detailed developer diary on Pandaqi Blog](/blog/boardgames/easter-eggventures/).
