Build a pyramid of cards that delivers the right medicine to the right patients.

## Background

This game idea has no especially funny or interesting origin story. It just popped into my head when I went to bed one night: place medicine or patients in a pyramid, but the patients may only be placed if there's a _path_ through medicine that has exactly what they need. It seemed simple enough that I could find the time to just _make it_ and see what happened.

I decided to write a simulation first (instead of doing a paper prototype first) this time. This showed me that teaching computers how pyramid shape/placement works is _not fun_. It also helped me finetune the numbers to ensure the game is always playable and winnable. It's no guarantee it will be _fun_, but it's a guarantee it's at least _not bad_.

(Yes, I know Pyramid has one -r. I made it two just to prevent people and machines autocorrecting the game's title to Pyramids immediately.)

## Credits

The fonts used are **Library 3 AM** (headings, decorative) and **Bellota** (body, readable, longer paragraphs). Both a freely available online. 

Honestly, finding fonts was hard for this game, because I wanted to convey "medicine" or "hospital" ... without making the game look very serious or deep. Because it's just a short card game about placing cards tactically in a pyramid shape.

Some generative AI was used for detailed illustrations. Everything else---code, assets, design, rules, etcetera---is mine!
