How would you communicate the word "house"? And how would you do it if you only had scales like cold->hot and soft->hard?

This is the _digital_ version of the party game Slippery Slopes, so you don't need to print anything and can play by simply [opening the game](game) on any device.

## Background

This game is the "digital" version of [Slippery Slopes](/slippery-slopes/). If you want a physical (offline) version of this idea, with more expansions and sliders, check that out!

While finishing that project, I realized there was nothing standing in the way of creating a digital version. The core of this game has only two parts (draw random words, mark something on a slider), and both of those are easy to do on a website, on any device.

Well, you know me, if I think "it shouldn't be _too_ hard to ..." then I've basically decided to try and make it this very weekend.

For more information, I refer you to the original game (and its credits/devlog at the bottom)!
