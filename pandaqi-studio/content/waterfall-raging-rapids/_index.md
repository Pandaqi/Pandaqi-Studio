This game is uses text for the action on tiles, which means some English reading comprehension is required. It also adds a few more rules and variations, making it a more complicated (but "deeper") version of the original.

If you want a very simple, textless, more casual game, check out the original [Waterfall](/waterfall/) game!

## Credits

This was actually the "original version" of my Waterfall game idea. After working on it, however, I realized how to make it simpler and remove all text. (This almost always happens and is why iteration is the magic word when trying to create _anything_.) That is why there are _two_ Waterfall games which I developed and released in parallel.

The basic rules for this game are still **incredibly simple**. But because each tile has a unique written action on it, I still decided to call it a bit slower to play and harder to play _well_ than the other version.

As such, for more background information or details, visit the [Waterfall](/waterfall/) project page.
