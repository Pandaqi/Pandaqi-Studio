This game is incredibly simple (just flip one tile and take its action) and well-suited for families and kids. This does require text on the tiles, however, which means players need some knowledge of the English language.

All **expansions and variants** can be played with the same base material too, so no more printing is needed.

## Wait, I Recognize That Name!

There is another (quite successful and recent) boardgame called "Captain Flip" too. 

This is _not_ that game---the name similarity is a coincidence.

I had finished development of my own game and page before it came out, otherwise I would have changed the name to literally anything else. Pretend this game has always been called "Memorybeard" or something. (I usually finish these games _far_ before publicly releasing them, so don't trust the release date.)

## Background

This game started its life as a simple idea: "could I create a game where your only action each turn is to _flip a tile_?" This felt like it should lead to a game that's very easy to learn but has lots of depth. It would combine a _memory game_ (which tiles are where, and what do they do?) and a _strategy game_ (flipping the right ones in the right way).

And that's how this game was made! I realized we needed different actions for _flipping faceup_ and _flipping facedown_. I invented some fun actions and slight rules tweaks to make it all balanced. Then I did a paper prototype that was too complicated, simplified it, and ended up with Captain Flip.

## Credits

The fonts used are **Underlapped** (headings, short texts) and **Sofia Sans Condensed** (body, paragraphs). Both are freely available. The sea creatures were generated using image AI. Everything else (code, design, rules, drawings, etcetera) is entirely mine.

(Underlapped is what is called a "double font". Each letter is itself twice. Very neat, discovered that while researching fonts for this game, and it just fit the theme---of each tile having two possible actions or states---perfectly.)
