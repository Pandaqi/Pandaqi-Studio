**Which pack(s) should I use!?** The packs mostly exist to break the huge number of possible cards into smaller chunks. There are no big differences. Each pack could be used standalone or mixed with any other packs in a game.

Except for the **extraordinary** pack! It contains more adult content, not suitable for every group. (It's also much smaller, so needs to be shuffled into existing packs.

## Background

This is an incredibly simple party game that naturally grew out of [The Game of Happiness](https://pandaqi.com/the-game-of-happiness/). While the original is a cooperative experience, this one is more a truly competitive game. 

I think the Game of Happiness works best in families or groups that want to actually explore what makes them (or their loved ones) happy. It's surely a game, but not competitive and more focused on emotions.

The Game of Dilemmas is more of a silly, gamified, creative, try-your-best-to-make-your-friends-laugh.

**Want to add your own cards?** You can always send me a message with ideas for cards! Once I have enough, I can easily add them as another pack.
