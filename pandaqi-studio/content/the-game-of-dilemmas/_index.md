The fonts used are **Sunny Spells** (headings, decorative) and **Minya Nouvelle** (body, text, paragraphs). Both freely available for commercial use. Everything else is entirely mine.

This is an incredibly simple party game that naturally grew out of [The Game of Happiness](https://pandaqi.com/the-game-of-happiness/). While the original is a cooperative experience, this one is more a truly competitive game. 

I think the Game of Happiness works best in families or groups that want to actually explore what makes them (or their loved ones) happy. It's surely a game, but not competitive and more focused on emotions.

The Game of Dilemmas is more of a silly, gamified, creative, try-your-best-to-make-your-friends-laugh.

**Want to add your own cards?** You can always send me a message with ideas for cards! Once I have enough, I can easily add them as another pack.
