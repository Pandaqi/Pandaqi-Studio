## Setup

Sort the cards into _positive_ and _negative_. Shuffle both piles and place them facedown. (The gray _neutral_ cards are ignored in the base game.)

All players draw 4 cards of each type into their hand.

## Objective

The game ends after 5 rounds. Highest score wins!


## Gameplay

All players simultaneously **create a dilemma**: combine a _positive_ card with a _negative_ card from your hand.

Once done, all dilemmas are revealed in the center of the table.

Then, players **grab tokens and vote**. Grab as many _yes_ and _no_ tokens as the number of dilemmas divided by 2, rounded up. 

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Example: 5 dilemmas means 3 _yes_ tokens and 3 _no_ tokens per player.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

For each dilemma, ask yourself if you'd say _yes_ or _no_ to this, then place the right token (facedown) on it.

Once done, all the vote tokens are revealed.

> The dilemma with the **smallest difference** between _yes_ and _no_ tokens wins the round. (This dilemma is "most controversial".)

All _yes_ tokens placed on it become points for the player who created the dilemma.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
In case of a tie, the dilemma with the most _no_ tokens wins. If still tied, all tied dilemmas win.

All players draw a new positive and negative card for their hand. Next round!


## Upgrades

**Neutral Cards:** each player also draws 1 neutral card. Whenever you want, you can add this card (as a third card) to a dilemma. You never draw more neutral cards, though---once used, it's gone.

**Supervotes:** each player receives one SUPER ACCEPT and one SUPER REJECT. When used, it counts for 3 votes. You must use these before the game is over, and once used they're gone.

**Coop Dilemmas:** instead of deciding the entire dilemma yourself, you do it together. Each player places one card (positive or negative) before them. 
* In **even rounds**, players then provide the other part of the dilemma for their **left neighbor**.
* In **odd rounds**, players then provide the other part of the dilemma for their **right neighbor**.

When a dilemma wins, the spoils are split between the two players who worked on it. Any leftovers (if unable to fairly distribute) go to the _second_ player.

Finally, players draw back the types of cards they used.
