== MAP ==
 -> Give different slots to different terrains
 -> Write rules for swapping tiles; what to do if a slot doesn't exist anymore?
 -> Find the fourth category
 -> Simplify:
	- Make certain categories optional or like an “expansion”
	- Reduce the number of options _within_ the category for the base game.
	- Make the “owner” bit an expansion as well
	- Make the map even smaller  

== HINTS ==
 -> Invent lots of them
 -> Write code for building hints and checking validity => allow writing all this custom code in a _separate_ file for clarity
 -> Distribute + Cut most irrelevant => test if this works completely
 -> Find clean method for generating LOCAL hints

== FINISHING TOUCHES ==
 -> Create materials PDF (tiles, tokens, something to track turns + conventions)
 -> Allow pregenerating games from within the website
 -> Create the interface again => copy most from Riddlebeard, perhaps make it cleaner
 -> Finish website + rulebook (fonts/images/links/wording/etc)
