## What do I need?

First time playing? Read the short [playful rules](rules).

For each game, you need two things: a paper board (to draw on) and a list of words.

You can generate [random boards](board). Print and play!

For the words, pick whatever style suits you best.

* **Like traditional games?** Click "Download" and print the material (3 pages of word cards). Reuse that anytime you want to play.
* **Don't mind a smartphone?** Use [the word generator](game) on a device (like a smartphone) to get secret words while playing.
* **Travelling? Low on space?** Enable the "include words" option when generating boards. This means the words are printed _on the board itself_.

**Remark** (for generating boards): For most game modes, using _core_ (or _easy_) words is ideal. With words printed on the board, however, the game becomes much easier and it's recommended to allow much harder words!

## Background

This was, as expected, the first and original version. It's probably also the simplest. Even though there are many ways to play (with a phone? without phone? printed word cards?), the core rules are incredibly simple yet always create challenges when trying to draw something.

Even though the other ideas came later and sought to give the game more depth or variation, I think I still prefer this first version the most. I'm just a person who likes really minimal and simple games that you can just pick up and instantly play with anyone.
