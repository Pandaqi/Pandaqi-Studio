## Setup

{{< rules-double-view src="starting_setup.webp" alt="Example of a random board + different ways to get random words." >}}

For each game, you need a board (to draw on) and random words. A board always has to be printed.

For words, pick the option you like best:

* Download word cards once, reuse every game
* Use the website on a phone while playing
* Use a board with words printed on it.

## Objective

Score the amount of food your board indicates. Try to do so using the least turns possible! In this **cooperative** mode, you all work together as one team.

You can also play **competitively**. Divide the players into two teams. The first team to reach _half the food threshold_ (rounded up) wins!


## Gameplay

Take clockwise turns until done.

{{< rules-double-view src="photomone_turn.webp" alt="Example of a turn: pick a word, draw, others guess." >}}

On your turn, get new words. Look at them _in secret_, then pick one. Each word has a number of **lines** and an amount of **food**.

Now communicate your word by drawing on the board! Draw as many lines as the word allows. Follow the [rules of drawing](#rules_of_drawing) (next section).

The others guess what you're drawing. Choose one of these options to limit turn length:

* Set a [timer](https://pandaqi.com/tools/timer/) of 60 or 90 seconds. 
* Or allow as many guesses as the number of lines you were allowed to draw. (Ask the guessers when a guess is definite, and only respond to those with "correct" or "incorrect".)

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Using words printed on the board? Players only get **one** (definite) guess. Cross out words once used.

Additionally, each drawing has to pass through one **rectangular spot** on the board.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

**Guessed correctly?** You score the food attached to the word!

Now it's your left neighbor's turn.

## Rules for Drawing

Of course, you can't just draw _any way you like_. 

* Lines must be straight and between two points.
* You can't add a line where it already exists. (The two points are already connected.)
* Lines can't go _through_ another point on their way.

{{< rules/rules-image src="rules_of_drawing.webp" alt="Example of what's allowed and not allowed when drawing." >}}

These are the only rules. So yes, anything else is allowed. (Lifting your pen to continue somewhere else, crossing lines, using points already used for other drawings, ... )


## Upgrades

### Sneaky Spots

This expansion turns the dots into many different locations! Each has a special ability or power. A location **activates** whenever it's the **end point of a new line** you draw. Its power is active _from now on_ ( = until the end of your turn).

{{< rules/rules-image src="sneaky_spots.webp" alt="Example of when a point activates + an example of the harder ones." >}}

{{< rules/rules-table class="big" >}}

    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Distance" >}}
        All points from your drawing must be within a certain distance of each other: the length of your thumb.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Food" >}}
        Changes the food you score by the number shown.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}

    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Curve" >}}
        Your lines are allowed to <strong>curve</strong> (instead of being straight).

        Your drawing must only use points that have <strong>not</strong> been used already.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
{{< /rules/rules-table >}}

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
About "distance": you can also use the word cards (if you printed those), or any other measurement tool of similar length.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}


### Precise Painters

This expansion adds even more special locations, with much more wild or chaotic effects.

{{< rules/rules-image src="precise_painters.webp" alt="Examples of the tougher powerups and how to use them." >}}

{{< rules/rules-table class="big" >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Add" >}}
        Add as many new points to the map (of any type) as the number shown. They can't overlap an existing line or point.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Remove" icon="remove">}}
        Remove as many points from the board as the number shown. (Cross them out, they're gone from now on.)
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Solid" icon="solid">}}
        Color in a closed shape on the board. (Add scribbles, turning the area completely solid and unusable.)
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Eyes" icon="eyes">}}
        Draw one circle in <em>empty space</em> ( = "between te lines"). It can be any size, filled or not, but <em>can't</em> include an existing point or line.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Unfinished" icon="unfinished">}}
        You may use any position on an existing line as the start / end point for new lines.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Eraser" >}}
        Erase as many lines as the number shown <em>from your current drawing</em>. (Cross them out. They don't exist, but their two points also can't receive a new line.) If you don't have enough lines, you can't use this location.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
{{< /rules/rules-table >}}


### Action Ants

At the start of the game, 

* Each player sketches their own (_unique_) ant icon.
* And draws it next to any dot.

On your turn, you must _start_ your drawing from where your ant currently is! Additionally, you're not allowed to lift your pen until you've drawn **6 lines**.

At the end of your turn, move your ant. Cross out the old drawing, draw it at the new location. However, it may only move **along drawn lines** by at most **6 steps**.

{{< rules/rules-image src="action_ants.webp" alt="Example of starting your drawing from your ant + moving at the end of your turn." >}}

{{< rules/rules-table class="single-line" >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Trap" >}}
        You <strong>cannot</strong> move your ant (at the end of your turn).
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Wings" >}}
        Changes how far your ant is allowed to move (at the end of your turn), by the amount shown.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Teleport" >}}
        When moving your ant (at the end of your turn), you're allowed to move <em>anywhere</em>!
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Poison Trail" >}}
        You are <strong>not</strong> allowed to go through ( = "cross") other lines.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
{{< /rules/rules-table >}}


### Coop Colony

Instead of one player drawing on their turn ... multiple players draw!

At the start of your turn, choose other players with whom you want to share the secret word. (You can't pick _all_ other players, but must pick at least _one_.)

Starting with you, all players who know the word alternate drawing **one line** at a time. Repeat this cycle until the drawing is done.

The players who don't know the secret word---and didn't participate in drawing---actually guess it.

{{< rules/rules-table class="single-line" >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Leader" >}}
        The player that activated this point, must finish the entire drawing on their own.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Dreamdrawing" >}}
        Even the players who <strong>don't</strong> know the word, participate in drawing one line at a time.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
{{< /rules/rules-table >}}


### Antertainment Break

This is a variant that allows taking _multiple_ turns for a drawing.

If a drawing **is not guessed**, you must resume it next turn. Write the lines and food for this word next to your current shape, to remember it.

Next turn, don't draw a new word, but continue drawing your old one. You get half the number of lines as previous turn (rounded down).

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
This cycle repeats until somebody guesses your word, or a special location bails you out. 
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
This expansion **can't** be used with the digital word interface.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

{{< rules/rules-table class="single-line" >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Break" >}}
        Pause your drawing immediately. (End your turn without guessing/scoring.)
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules/rules-table-entry heading="Pants on Fire" >}}
        You <strong>can't</strong> pause your drawing. If it's not guessed this turn, you get -5 food.
    {{< /rules/rules-table-entry >}}
{{< /rules/rules-table >}}
