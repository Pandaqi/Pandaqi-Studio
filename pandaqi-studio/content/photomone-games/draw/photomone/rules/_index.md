{{< rules-double-view src="starting_setup.webp" alt="Example of a random board + different ways to get random words." >}}

For each game, you need a board (to draw on) and random words. A board always has to be printed.

For words, pick the option you like best:

* Download word cards once, reuse every game
* Use the website on a phone while playing
* Use a board with words printed on it.

Score the amount of food your board indicates. Try to do so using the least turns possible! In this **cooperative** mode, you all work together as one team.

You can also play **competitively**. Divide the players into two teams. The first team to reach _half the food threshold_ (rounded up) wins!

{{< rules-double-view src="photomone_turn.webp" alt="Example of a turn: pick a word, draw, others guess." >}}

Get new words. Look at them _in secret_, then pick one. Each word has a number of **lines** and an amount of **food**.

Now communicate your word by drawing on the board! Draw as many lines as the word allows. Follow the [rules of drawing](#rules_of_drawing) (next section).

The others guess what you're drawing. Choose one of these options to limit turn length:

* Set a [timer](https://pandaqi.com/tools/timer/) of 60 or 90 seconds. 
* Or allow as many guesses as the number of lines you were allowed to draw. (Ask the guessers when a guess is definite, and only respond to those with "correct" or "incorrect".)

{{% remark %}}
Using words printed on the board? Players only get **one** (definite) guess. Cross out words once used.

Additionally, each drawing has to pass through one **rectangular spot** on the board.
{{% /remark %}}

**Guessed correctly?** You score the food attached to the word!

Now it's your left neighbor's turn.

{{% rules-block id="rules_of_drawing" heading="Rules for Drawing" icon="beware" icontint="purple" %}}

Of course, you can't just draw _any way you like_. 

* Lines must be straight and between two points.
* You can't add a line where it already exists. (The two points are already connected.)
* Lines can't go _through_ another point on their way.

{{< rules-image src="rules_of_drawing.webp" alt="Example of what's allowed and not allowed when drawing." >}}

These are the only rules. So yes, anything else is allowed. (Lifting your pen to continue somewhere else, crossing lines, using points already used for other drawings, ... )

{{% rules-block id="expansion-sneakySpots" heading="Sneaky Spots" %}}

This expansion turns the dots into many different locations! Each has a special ability or power. A location **activates** whenever it's the **end point of a new line** you draw. Its power is active _from now on_ ( = until the end of your turn).

About "distance": you can also use the word cards (if you printed those), or any other measurement tool of similar length.

{{% rules-block id="expansion-actionAnts" heading="Action Ants" class="force-page-break-before" %}}

At the start of the game, 

* Each player sketches their own (_unique_) ant icon.
* And draws it next to any dot.

On your turn, you must _start_ your drawing from where your ant currently is! Additionally, you're not allowed to lift your pen until you've drawn **6 lines**.

At the end of your turn, move your ant. Cross out the old drawing, draw it at the new location. However, it may only move **along drawn lines** by at most **6 steps**.

{{< rules-table class="single-line" >}}

{{% rules-block id="expansion-coopColony" heading="Coop Colony" %}}

Instead of one player drawing on their turn ... multiple players draw!

At the start of your turn, choose other players with whom you want to share the secret word. (You can't pick _all_ other players, but must pick at least _one_.)

Starting with you, all players who know the word alternate drawing **one line** at a time. Repeat this cycle until the drawing is done.

The players who don't know the secret word---and didn't participate in drawing---actually guess it.

{{< rules-table class="single-line" >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Leader" icon="leader" >}}
        The player that activated this point, must finish the entire drawing on their own.
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Dreamdrawing" icon="dreamdrawing" >}}
        Even the players who <strong>don't</strong> know the word, participate in drawing one line at a time.

{{% rules-block id="expansion-antertainmentBreak" heading="Antertainment Break" class="force-page-break-before" %}}

This is a variant that allows taking _multiple_ turns for a drawing.

If a drawing **is not guessed**, you must resume it next turn. Write the lines and food for this word next to your current shape, to remember it.

Next turn, don't draw a new word, but continue drawing your old one. You get half the number of lines as previous turn (rounded down).

        You <strong>can't</strong> pause your drawing. If it's not guessed this turn, you get -5 food.
