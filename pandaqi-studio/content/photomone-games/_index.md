## What's this?

This is the **overview page** for the Photomone Games.

Click any of the links below to visit a specific game. They aren't sorted in any way.

<div class="photomone-link-block">
Try <a href="/photomone-games/draw/photomone/">Photomone</a> (the original) for a very simple game about communicating words, but you may only draw straight lines between the random dots on the map.
</div>

<div class="photomone-link-block">
Try <a href="/photomone-games/draw/photomone-digital-antists/">Photomone: Digital Ant-ists</a> for a spin-off that you can play entirely on a single smartphone or tablet!
</div>

<div class="photomone-link-block">
Try <a href="/photomone-games/draw/photomone-antsassins/">Photomone: Antsassins</a> for a "traditional" board game that turns the idea on its head. Similar to Codenames, but now you communicate with shapes and color.
</div>


## Credits

The fonts used are **Proza Libre** and **GelDotica**. All other assets and code are mine.

This idea started its life many years ago when I saw a game called "StarLink". In that game---you never guessed it---you must draw things by connecting stars with straight lines. 

However, that's where the game stopped. I tried to continue the idea further, take it in completely new directions, and provide that for free.

For a detailed diary about the game, check out the [devlog](/blog/boardgames/photomone/).
