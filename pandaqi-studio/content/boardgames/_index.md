## Traditional Games

These are my "regular" boardgames. They are more similar to the typical boardgame. (Unlike my _Hybrid_ games that add a digital element, or my _One Paper Games_ that you play by writing on paper.)

Because it's print-n-play, I mostly create card games, tile games and simple party games. Though with a bit of imagination I've been able to craft many different types of printable games. 

This is by far the largest category of games on this website. If unfamiliar with my work, these games are more "safe" to try first, because they're less "experimental".

## One Paper Games

These games only require you to print _a single sheet of paper_ and find a pen(cil) somewhere! (Sometimes even a blank paper is enough!)

This simplicity is great. You can download, explain, carry, play or pause these games instantly.

## Hybrid

**Hybrid games** are a combination of a _board game_ and a _video game_.

In other words, they have an offline component (usually a physical board, pieces, cards, etc.) and a digital component (their website), which work together to create magic.

Sometimes an offline mode is present or the digital component is optional. But the reason I make these games is precisely _because_ a digital component adds so many possibilities you don't want to miss!

## How does it work?

Click on a game to reach the official game page.

It has a big button labeled "Download". Clicking that leads to a folder with all the files. (I use Google Drive, quick and free for anyone.)

The structure is always as follows:
* **Rules** contains the rulebook
* **Files** contains any files to print

Most of the time, those files are _optional_. Because my games are often randomly generated or have expansions, the Files folder provides all those options, but you only need to pick one PDF. (The precise material you need is always explained in the rules and on the page.)

The files are also usually sorted. For a first game you can just pick the very first file (starting with a "1") and be on your way!

The project sometimes contains a third folder called "Vault". That's where I store backups of older versions or variants.

## Print & Play

It means you can download the game files, print them yourself, and then play them&mdash;for free!

* **Advantages**: you get free games, I can create any game I want (not just whatever is "commercially viable"), and games are constantly updated (using your feedback)! It's way more environmentally friendly and there are many game types that wouldn't be possible any other way (as my most experimental games show).
* **Disadvantages**: you have to do a tiny bit of work to get the game. Also, the components aren't as nice and game quality isn't guaranteed.

This website has detailed **metadata** per project to help you find exactly what you're looking for.

* If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you can see things like _supported player counts, language, genre, game mechanics_. Click on any of them to find all games that match.
* At the top of most board games is a summary of that, showing only _complexity, player count, and playtime_. 
* _Playtime_ is a guess based on my own testing, certainly not a guarantee. It is measured in minutes, rounded to nicer values.
* Because I strive to make the absolute simplest games possible, it turned out to be useless to call games "easy, medium, hard". Instead, _Complexity_ has more specific values: _no brainer, kids could play, simple, regular, challenge_. 

All games on this website are completely developed by me and unavailable anywhere else. If you want to find other print-and-play games (potentially of famous games you already love!) check out these other resources:

* [Asmodee](https://print-and-play.asmodee.fun/en/all/games) has an excellent website with print-and-play versions for many of their (famous) games!
* [PNP Arcade](https://www.pnparcade.com/) brings together both free and paid PNP versions of games of many different publishers
* [Good Little Games](http://www.goodlittlegames.co.uk/index.html) not only gives free PNP games, it's also minimalist: their games never require more than 27 cards or 3 papers to print.
