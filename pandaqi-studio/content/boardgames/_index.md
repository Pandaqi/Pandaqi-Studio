These games only require you to print _a single sheet of paper_ and find a pen(cil) somewhere! (Sometimes even a blank paper is enough!)

This simplicity is great. You can download, explain, carry, play or pause these games instantly.

Additionally, they are language-independent. Only one person needs to understand English to read the rules, all other files don't have (essential) text.

{{% section-centered heading="Hybrid" anchor="hybrid" %}}

**Hybrid games** are a combination of a _boardgame_ and a _video game_.

In other words, they have an offline component (usually a physical board, pieces, cards, etc.) and a digital component (their website), which work together to create magic.

Sometimes an offline mode is present or the digital component is optional. But the reason I make these games is precisely _because_ a digital component adds so many possibilities you don't want to miss!

{{% section-centered heading="Traditional Games" anchor="traditional"  %}}

These are my "regular" boardgames. They are more similar to the typical boardgame, unlike my _hybrid_ games that add a digital element.

Older games are available in multiple languages: Dutch and English. Newer ones are completely English.

Click on a game, any game.

This will take you to the official game page, with a big button labeled "Download".

Clicking that leads to a folder with all the files. (I use Google Drive, quick and free for anyone.)

The structure is always as follows:
- **Rules** contains the rulebook
- **Files** contains any files to print

Most of the time, those files are _optional_. Because my games are often randomly generated or have expansions, the Files folder provides all those options, but you only need to pick one PDF. (The precise material you need is always explained in the rules and on the page.)

The files are also usually sorted. For a first game you can just pick the very first file (starting with a "1") and be on your way!

The project sometimes contains a third folder called "Vault". That's where I store backups of older versions or variants.

It means you can download the game files, print them yourself, and then play them &mdash; for free!

This system has a few obvious **disadvantages**: the components aren't as nice and game quality isn't guaranteed.

But also numerous **advantages**: you get free games, I can create any game I want (not just whatever is "commercially viable"), and games are constantly updated (using your feedback)!

Additionally, as this page shows, there are many game types ... that are literally impossible any other way.

All games on this website are completely developed by me and unavailable anywhere else. If you want to find other print-and-play games (potentially of famous games you already love to play!) check out these other resources:

* [Asmodee](https://print-and-play.asmodee.fun/en/all/games) has an excellent website with print-and-play versions for many of their (famous) games!
* [PNP Arcade](https://www.pnparcade.com/) brings together both free and paid PNP versions of games of many different publishers
