## Setup

Print a paper and grab some pens. Pick any start player.

Each player invents their own unique symbol and draws it on any unused starting square. (The highlighted squares with a square center + red pin.)

## Objective

The game ends as soon as **all players are out**. Each player checks the entire path that they walked. Sum the values of all squares: **highest score wins**!


## Gameplay

### Simple Rules

Take clockwise turns. On your turn, always do the same thing: **take one step**. 

* On your current location, pick _one_ of its icons to be the correct one. (Clearly cross out all the others.)
* Move one step in that direction. (Draw your player icon inside the circle of the new square.)
* If you can't move---there is no square or it's already used---you're out of the game. (Take no more turns. You still score at the end, of course!)

Forgot where your pawn is now? Find the square that has your player icon but also still has all its icons!

That's it!

The paper itself explains how each Square works and/or how it scores. You can also read the next section on the [Squares](#squares).


### Advanced Rules

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="gameplay_advanced.webp" alt="Example of a turn following the advanced rules." >}}

When playing with advanced sets, you probably want to use the advanced rules. They provide more choice and freedom of movement, to balance the tougher special squares.

There is only one change: **when moving, you skip over squares already taken.** 

You land on the first available free square in the chosen direction. Only if _that_ doesn't exist, you're out of the game.




## Squares

When squares talk about some type being "visible", it means exactly what you think. It doesn't matter whether the square is visited or not, as long as the icon _is showing_ (not crossed out), it's on the board.

When squares talk about "destroying", it means crossing out **all** its icons. (So it represents nothing.) If a player is currently there, they don't die. Just leave them be---you can't die in this game.

When you use only the "base" set, the game activates "simple mode". The Boots square is _always_ included and the simple rules are displayed, as that provides the most movement in-game for the least complexity.

Below is an overview of _all_ squares in the game.
