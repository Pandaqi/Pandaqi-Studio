A [One Paper Game](/boardgames#one_paper_games) about exploring a world where each square is multiple things at once---until you step onto it.

## Background

This is probably my game with the highest ratio of "rules" to "depth". 

The game is extremely simple! In fact, it is explained on the paper itself, and even that leaves more than enough room for anything else. 

Yet the core idea behind those rules allows a _lot_ of strategy, play styles, and therefore depth. Every turn is the same simple decision (between 4 icons), but every single decision matters a lot for every turn after it. And to make matters worse, other players are doing the same thing, all within a shared map.

While obviously not on the same level as Chess or Go, I do compare its general feel to those games.

I sometimes feel like those games aren't so much "designed" as that they are "found". This feels like a game that was always there, I just found it and hopefully executed it well enough :)
