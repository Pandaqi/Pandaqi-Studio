Each player receives **9 random cards**. Place them in a faceup stack before you: your **life deck**.

Shuffle the remaining cards and deal fairly until empty. These are your (secret) **hand cards**. 

Finally, pick anyone to be the Kittykeeper.

The game ends when **a player runs out of lives**. The players with the **most lives** left win.

This is a trick-taking game with a twist. 

The Kittykeeper starts, then take clockwise turns around the table.

* On your turn, play a card from your hand _or_ play your current life ( = the top card of your life deck).
* **If possible,** you must play the same suit as one **already played**. (The Kittykeeper can thus play anything. The suit of their card is called the _leading suit_.)
* The special power on your card **only activates** if it's played as a life card.

Once everyone has played, decide the winner: the player who played the **highest card** in the **leading suit**.

Now every player checks the _total_ number of the suit they played. (Sum the numbers on all cards in that suit.)
* If it's **greater than 9** (it "exploded"), you **lose a life**.
* Otherwise, nothing happens.

If you played a _life_ card this round, you get it back.
* You're the winner? Put it at the bottom of your Life Deck.
* Otherwise? Choose whether to take it into your hand or discard it.

All other cards played are discarded. The winner becomes the new Kittykeeper.

Next round!

Each card has a **suit**, a **number** and a **special power**.

As stated, the special power _only_ activates when the card is played as a Life Card.

Only the _top_ card of your lives deck is relevant (and can be played) at any given time. Though you're allowed to look through your life deck at any time.
