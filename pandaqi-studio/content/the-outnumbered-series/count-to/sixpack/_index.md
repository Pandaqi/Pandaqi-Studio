You get six cards. Play them well, but don't be the first to play them all.

**Reminder** (when generating your own material): You always need (at least) one more pack than the number of players.

## Background

This game was inspired by a play session of the game "Take 5". (In the Netherlands, confusingly, this is the _original_ version of the game, published under the name of the _new_ and radically different version.) I thought the game was strong, yet simple and easy to pick up. Naturally, I wanted to try my own hand at such a card game (with numbers and sequences).

Because the rules are so simple, I could spend most of the time on the art and visuals of the cards. The end result is probably my nicest game in terms of graphics and rules!
