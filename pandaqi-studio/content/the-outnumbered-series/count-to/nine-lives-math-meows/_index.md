## Background

As expected, this game is a spin-off for the original [Nine Lives](/the-outnumbered-series/count-to/nine-lives/).

Interestingly, though, this game was actually the original idea! As I developed it, I noticed it had a bit too many numbers for some people's taste and realized ways to simplify the game. That's how "Nine Lives" came to life. Eventually, I selected _that_ game as the "original" because of its simplicity and playability for families with young kids.

For more information, as always, read my [detailed developer diary on Pandaqi Blog](/blog/boardgames/the-outnumbered-series/nine-lives-math-meows/).
