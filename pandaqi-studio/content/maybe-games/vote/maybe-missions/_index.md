## Credits

The unique font for this game is **Star Trebek**, freely available online. (Designed to be a space or sci-fi font, which you can tell, but I thought it fit well in this game too.) Some of the illustrations are AI generated. Everything else is entirely mine.

This was the very first, original idea for the Maybe Games. Just a game about proposing a mission, then voting YES/NO, and based on that players would be rewarded or punished. A simple mechanic, low material requirements, yet lots of gameplay possibilities.

In the end, I moved the "secret identities" (which were part of the original idea and make the game way more strategic and thematic) to an expansion just to keep the base game absolutely as simple as possible. That's what I usually do. 

I'd rather people think "wow this game is so simple, let's try it this weekend" and then realize there is an expansion that makes it much better. Because the alternative is people thinking "woah this game has a lot of rules" and they don't even try it in the first place ;)
