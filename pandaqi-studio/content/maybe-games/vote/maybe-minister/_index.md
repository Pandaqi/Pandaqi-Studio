The unique font for this game is **Blackwood Castle**, freely available online. Some of the illustrations are AI generated. Everything else is entirely mine.

This was the latest entry to the project, and I knew from the start it would be the most "strategic" one. A few more rules, a few more mechanics to learn, and the core mechanic (of voting simultaneously on stuff) would allow a more complex game about power and politics.

Being the most complicated one, it was the hardest (and took the longest) to get right. Because people like _deep_ games, but not _complicated_ ones, so I had to search for ways to simplify the rules at all times. 

For most people, I still think it's best to play the games in the order mentioned, trying this one last. If you've played the others, even if it's only a game or two, the rules for this one fall into place naturally.
