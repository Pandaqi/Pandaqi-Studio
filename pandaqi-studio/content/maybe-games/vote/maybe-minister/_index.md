A [Maybe Game](/maybe-games/) about changing the law and expanding power. But you can only do so if the other politicians around the table vote the way you need.

Three simple steps.

The unique font for this game is **Blackwood Castle**, freely available online. Some of the illustrations are AI generated. Everything else is entirely mine.

This was the latest entry to the project, and I knew from the start it would be the most "strategic" one. A few more rules, a few more mechanics to learn, and the core mechanic (of voting simultaneously on stuff) would allow a more complex game about power and politics.

Being the most complicated one, it was the hardest (and took the longest) to get right. Because people like _deep_ games, but not _complicated_ ones, so I had to search for ways to simplify the rules at all times. 

For most people, I still think it's best to play the games in the order mentioned, trying this one last. If you've played the others, even if it's only a game or two, the rules for this one fall into place naturally.
