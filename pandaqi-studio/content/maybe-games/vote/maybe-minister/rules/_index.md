Create a deck of **Votes**. 

Each player receives a **Support** card of value 1 (green side up). Place it in front of you with 2 Votes on top of it.

Finally, deal all players **5 Cards** to take into their hand.

{{% rules-double-view src="objective.webp" alt="Example of how to determine your current number of points, using enacted Laws." %}}

The **laws** you enact in-game give you the scoring rules over time. (Example: "Gold is worth 2 points".)

The game ends when a player has accrued **25 points (or more)**. They win!

From start player, take clockwise turns. Each turn has three simple phases: _propose_, _vote_ and _collect_.

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Propose" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="gameplay_propose.webp" alt="Example of how make a new proposal on your turn." %}}

On your turn, **make a proposal**.
* Place 2--5 cards from your hand faceup on the table.
* Only refill your hand (back to 5) when it's empty.

{{% rules-block heading="Vote" %}}

Everyone **votes** on this proposal.
* From your possible votes---all Votes on cards you've won---secretly pick the one you want.
* Once done, everyone simultaneously reveals their vote.
* If the majority voted NO, the proposal is **REJECTED**. Otherwise, it is **ACCEPTED**.

If **accepted**, all LAW cards become permanent rules in the game. Otherwise, discard them.

Finally, sort all the voters 
* **Accepted**? Sort from LOW to HIGH (vote numbers). Otherwise, sort HIGH to LOW instead.
* In that order, everyone takes one card from the proposal. (Cycle until all cards taken.)
* If **accepted**, place that card before you with the green side up. Otherwise, place it red side up.

On cards you've won, only the side pointing up ( = away from you) is the one that's true. The green side means these icons are _added_, the red side means these are _removed_. 

{{% remark %}}
The term "flipping" a card means rotating it so the other side is up.

{{% rules-block heading="Collect" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="gameplay_collect.webp" alt="Example of how to collect (and store) your new Votes at the end of each round." %}}

Everyone collects **new votes**. 
* Sum the number of icons on your **support** cards. If above 0, draw that number of Votes. If below 0, you lose that number of Votes.
* You _may_ discard any other **resource** card you own to get +2 Votes.

You must always have at least 1 Vote for the next round. As such, if you have no _support_ and no _resources_, you still collect 1.

You must **store** these votes on cards you've won. Each card, however, can only store a limited amount. You can't draw more than you can store.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or feel like your group needs some tweaks to the game? Check out these expansions.

{{% rules-block heading="Wildcard Variant" %}}

On the website, you can decide to include the **Wildcard Icon** (question mark) in the material. 

This icon simply represents "whatever icon you want" (at the moment). It makes the game easier and faster.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Abstain Attacks" %}}

This expansion adds **Abstain** votes and **Law** cards that modify them.

When a player uses this vote, it simply doesn't count. Pretend it's not there. The player does not collect a card or influence voting in any way.

This basic rule, of course, can change when certain Laws are passed.

{{% rules-block heading="Undecided Voters" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="undecided_voters.webp" alt="Examples of the newly added 4th phase: Move Votes (and the two ways to do it)." %}}

This expansion needs no extra material. (You _can_ add Law cards that specifically target this mechanic.)

Add a _fourth phase_ to each round: **Move Votes**. From start player, in clockwise order, each player may do a "vote move".

There are two options: Law or Card.

**Law:** move 1 stored Vote onto an enacted **Law** card. If a Law currently contains more NO than YES votes, it's disabled (and must not be followed anymore)!

{{% /rules-double-view %}}

**Card:** play 2 Votes to any collected card, which has the **red** side up. This can be your own card or that of another player.

* Playing 2 NO votes removes the card. (This loses all votes it had stored.)
* Playing 2 YES votes flips it to the green side. (This keeps votes stored on it.)

As usual, you must always have at least 1 Vote for the next round (i.e. you can't move your final Vote).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Advanced Politics" %}}

This expansion adds **Laws** (of type "shop") and **Resources** with special powers (in text, not icons). This requires printing _new material_.

These "shop Laws" allow you to pay Resources to get a certain reward. 
* If you decide to take this action, you must do so at the **start or end** of a round.
* **Paying** happens by discarding the card(s) you used. You cannot "split" a card: you either pay the entire card or not.

The Special Resources might have actions to take. These can be taken at any time, by discarding the card (as the text itself states).

When a Special Resource looks at the resources someone has, **ignore** any Special Resources (as they can vary or be unknown). Only consider icons from the _base cards_.
