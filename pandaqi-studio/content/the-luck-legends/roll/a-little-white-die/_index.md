I think the game _Liar's Dice_ is very good. It's extremely simple, anyone can play and have a chance at winning, and it's just a great entry for people into gaming (or to play with large groups at a party).

When I invented the Luck Legends, I quickly realized I could create an alternative version of the game! Using my new mechanic---representing dice using decks of cards---I could keep the things I like about the game and add a little more spice. (And, of course, make it playable for people who don't have lots of dice.)

That's how this game (and Deceptidice, a variant focused on guessing/bluffing combos or poker hands) came to be. It also became just as simple as Liar's Dice, if not simpler, which is why it's at the top of the list for this project.
