## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" alt="Example of how to setup a game and the different kinds of material." >}}

Create a deck of **Zoo Cards**. Place the top 4 cards faceup on the table.

Deal all players 6 random **Animal Cards**. This is their "die". Place the remaining cards as a facedown draw pile.



## Objective

The game ends as soon as a player has **scored 10(+) points**. They win!


## Gameplay

{{< rules/rules-example id="turn" >}}

On your turn, 

* **Pick a Zoo Card** from the options on the table. (Then refill from deck.)
* **Pick an opponent**. This can be any other player.

You and your opponent "roll your die": shuffle your personal deck and reveal a random card.

The chosen [Zoo Card](#zoo_cards) tells you which player has the **most valuable animal**. They win the Zoo Card and place it faceup before them. (Check if anyone has scored enough points to win the game!)

In case of a **tie**, one battler must discard a card and the other wins the Zoo Card. The active player decides who gets what. Discarded cards are _secret_; you can't discard your final card.

That's it, have fun!

## Zoo Cards

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="zoo_cards.webp" alt="The different parts of a Zoo Card and how to use its cycle to find the best animal in a battle." >}}

A Zoo Card states how **valuable** animals are this turn. It also shows a **number**: how many points it's worth.

This information is like "rock, paper, scissors": one animal is better than another, is better than another, and so forth.

To know who wins a battle, find who played **the best animal**: 

> Your animal is "better" if the **distance** (number of arrows) between your animal and the opponent's animal is **larger** than the other way around.

Sometimes, this cycle does not include all animals. All **missing animals** are considered _equal in value_, but _less valuable_ than all included animals.



## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variants

To give the game **more decisions** to make, use the following variant.

* For every battle, count the number of arrows on the zoo card.
* Battlers select only **that many cards** from their die. (The others are temporarily put aside.)
* Now roll this reduced die (instead of your entire hand).

For example, a Zoo card with 3 arrows means that the two battlers pick 3 of their cards first (which they think will give them the highest chance of a win) and only shuffle + reveal from _that_.

To make the game **less random**, use the "no shuffle" variant.

* You only shuffle your die at the start of the game.
* When "rolling" your die, simply grab the top card.
* If you ever get your card back (after rolling but losing) place it at the bottom.
* When you reach **5 points** or **draw a new card** (possible with expansions), shuffle once more.

To make the game **longer** (and your die more changeable), use the following variant.

* Whenever you win a Zoo card, you can decide to **draw Animal cards instead** (increasing your hand size).
* You draw as many as the **score** number on that Zoo card you refused.


### Busy Zoo

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_busy_zoo.webp" alt="Example of a battle between many different players (in a Busy Zoo)" >}}

This expansion adds new material: Zoo Cards with special requirements (on top of the usual cycle).

Some Zoo Cards include the "people icon". If you choose this card,

* **All** players roll their die. 
* As usual, the winner is the animal with the _largest_ gap between themselves and the next animal in the cycle.

If there are 2 winners, the "tie" rules apply but only to them. If there are 3(+) winners, some of them simply get nothing, at the active player's discretion.



### Wild Animals

This expansion adds new material: Animal Cards with special powers. These are written on the card and always the same per animal. 

These only apply if _written on the card_. That is, base game cards DON'T have the special powers of their species.
