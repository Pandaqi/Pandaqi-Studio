I've made many games now that have numbered cards and "highest wins". The recurring issue when designing all of those was the fact that you can simply get very (un)lucky with your cards. If higher numbers are always better, well, getting higher numbers in your starting hand is always better (and leads to a more unfair and boring game)!

Until I realized that _rock, paper, scissors_ exists. Each element can defeat another element, but also be _defeated by_ another element. So I wondered: can we do the same for a boardgame? Can we do battles between players where things are ordered in a _cycle_ instead of certain cards simply always being better?

That's how this idea was born! You roll your die (with animals), but you also select a Zoo Card that says "animal A > animal B > animal C > animal A again". Any animal, depending on the circumstances, could have an easy victory or a devastating loss. It now depends on your strategy; not luck of the draw.

This also turned out to be the simplest of all my ideas for the Luck Legends, which is why I put it first on the list.
