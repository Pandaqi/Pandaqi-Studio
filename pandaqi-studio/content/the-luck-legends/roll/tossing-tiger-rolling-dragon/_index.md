The fonts used are **Chinese Rocks** (headings) and **Koho** (body text). Everything else is mine.

The idea of an "auto-battler" probably came from _Challengers!_ Though this game is a heavily modified version and barely recognizable as such. Yes, the battle between two players (during a turn) has parts that automatically resolve following simple rules. But you might get a lot of choices before, during, and after that makes it far from "automatic". (Both players do, in fact---both the attacker and defender.)

I combined that idea with a powerful feature of my "dice as cards system": completely custom dice. The cards in this game have no numbers or inherent "high/low" values. Instead, the cards are very diverse and have a sort of "rock, paper, scissors" relationship. A strong kick might beat certain cards ... but be completely weak against others.

After some refinement, the game became a very simple but unique experience with a silly martial arts style. This refinement mostly came down to simplifying and removing half my ideas for animals, because having more than 10 unique cards that can appear is just too much. It also doesn't work well with a "weakness" system: if there are 20 animals, how are you ever going to display the 10 animals to which something is weak on just a small card? ;)

Honestly, though, the more I researched the typical animals associated with asian martial arts and stances ... the more I realized I was just listing all characters and villains from the _Kung Fu Panda_ franchise. I decided I was okay with that.
