{{% rules-block heading="Setup" icon="setup" %}}

Deal all players a random deck of **6 cards**. Place all remaining cards to the side as a facedown draw pile.

For your first game, just follow the simple base rules. Once familiar with the rules, however, I recommend using the [Simulwars](#simulwars) variant so that players can fight simultaneously instead of waiting for their turn.

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

The game **ends** when a player has **fewer than 2 cards left**. Whoever has the **most cards** at that moment wins!

{{% rules-block heading="Gameplay" icon="action" %}}

From start player, take clockwise turns. On your turn you always **wage war** against another player.

* Pick another player to fight.
* Say a **number**. That's how many piles (or "dice") both fighters must create out of their deck. 
* Every pile must have at least 2 cards (_if possible_). You can't pick a number you or your opponent can't legally follow.
* When done, shuffle your piles well.

Once those piles are created, place them in pairs (one against one) on the table, in two rows. Every single pair is called a "battle"; the entire turn is called a "war".

{{< rules-image src="gameplay_prepare.webp" alt="Example of how to prepare for war; say a number, break your deck into that many piles, shuffle." >}}

For every pair, from left to right (for the attacker), 

* **Roll the dice**. That is, simply reveal the top cards.
* Some cards have **special actions**. Handle those now: attacker first, defender second.
  * If they require a choice, its player makes that choice now.
* **Check who won** this battle. 
  * If one card is _strong_ against the other, it wins.
  * If both are _strong_ against each other, both players win.
  * Otherwise, nobody wins.

{{< rules-image src="gameplay_battle.webp" alt="Example of how find out the result of an entire war, by executing individual battles from left to right." >}}

This continues until all battles have been fought. Then, both players get their spoils of war.

* For every **battle you've won**, grab 1 card from the opponent's pile (inside that battle).
* If you **won the war**---you won the majority of battles---you grab the _entire pile_ from one of your won battles. (If it's a tie, nobody wins.)

For all cards grabbed, decide if you want to take them into your hand or discard them.

_Beware!_ Wait with grabbing your spoils until the _war is definitely over_. Actions are executed immediately, yes, but later actions might still change how the war ends or what you get in the end.

That's it! Have fun!

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Simulwars" id="simulwars" %}}

Instead of waging wars between 2 players at a time, everyone wages their war _simultaneously_. Each round,

* In clockwise order (from current start player) ...
* Everyone simply picks an opponent that isn't in a war yet ...
* Until _all players_ are in a war. 

Now your players have been divided into pairs, and they can just wage war at the same time! No need to wait.

If you have an **odd** number of players, the start player of a round does not join a war. Instead, they might arbiter if others are waging their war legally.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Highscore" %}}

For a **deeper and more tactical game**, change the rules for who wins the game.

* The number of **strengths** on a card is its _value in negative points_. (For example, an animal with 3 strengths is worth -3.)
* At the end of the game, every player sums the points of every card in their hand. 
* Highest score wins! (That is, the _least negative_ score.)

Or alternatively, also for a **more tactical game**, add this little extra rule.

> Once per war, if your card has an action, you can decide _not_ to execute it. If so, look at the top cards of an upcoming battle and reshuffle your die if wanted.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: More Animals!" %}}

This expansion adds more animals with their unique strengths and powers.

Terminology clarifications:

* **"Earlier battles"** refers to all battles _before_ this card's position in the row. If this is the very first card, such a power always **does nothing** (as there haven't been any battles yet).
* **"Later battles"** refers to all battles _after_ this card's position in the row. (Which are yet to come and should be unrevealed at this time.)
* A **reroll**, by default, just means rolling your specific dice for one battle again. If it means something else---such as _both_ players rolling---this is clearly stated.
* To **lose on purpose**, means you declare _before revealing a battle_ that "I concede this battle!". You still reveal, but no actions trigger and the opponent simply wins that battle.
* To **destroy** a card means to permanently discard it, out of the game.
* To **draw** a card means to draw blind from the top of the draw pile and take into your hand/deck.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Fight Together" %}}

In this expansion, all players are involved in every single war (just like the _Simulwars_ variant). The difference, though, is that this expansion works in _teams_ and also allows an odd number of players to be active at all times.

During **setup**, break the players into two teams as fairly as possible: A and B.

The **objective** changes as follows.
* After every war, the loser must place one card to the side. (If nobody wins, both are losers.)
* Once this "war pile" has 10 cards, the game ends. The team with the most cards (combined) wins.
* If a player ever has 2 cards or fewer, the game also ends, and that player's team loses.

During **gameplay**,
* Every round is a battle between these two teams. 
* The "attacker" alternates between Team A and Team B.

The biggest change is in how dice/piles are created at the start of a war.

* The current attacker states a **number** (of dice), as usual. 
* This number must be greater than the number of players on their team.
* Every team member must supply at least one _die_. (Who delivers any leftover dice is up for discussion within the team.)
* Every die must contain at least 3 cards, but there's no maximum size.

Then the game continues as normal: place piles, reveal, execute the war. If there's a choice to be made, the player who supplied that pile makes it.

Finally, any cards grabbed are divided amongst the team members however they like

**Communication is restricted.** Team members can't tell each other the cards in their hand or dice. They can only literally say what they want: "I want to be the second pile", or "I am fine with supplying 2 dice", or "I want that and that card from the spoils of war". (This includes, of course, affirming they understand the plan or will do as promised.)

The only new material you need is a small set of **communication cards**.

* If revealed in battle, they allow you to communicate freely about this war, until the next card is revealed. (You may say what's in your dice, what's in your hand, anything!)
* But it always _loses_ its current battle.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Dawndojo" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="expansion_dawndojo.webp" alt="Example of how to read a Rooster card." %}}

This expansion adds Rooster Cards.

How to use them?

* On your turn, when creating your dice, you _may_ play such a card.
* Place it faceup in the position of the first pile (_instead_ of creating a pile for it).
* Its rule will be true for the entire war that follows. (This is usually a restriction on what can be played or done.)

{{% /rules-double-view %}}

In battle, this first Rooster card (called "Dawncard") will _always lose_. 

The _"Rooster Change"_, however, applies to all Roosters played later (through a regular roll). In a sense, the Dawncard decides how all Roosters (from both you and the opponent) fight the rest of the war.
