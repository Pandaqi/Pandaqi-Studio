## Setup

Deal all players a random deck of **8 cards**. Everyone picks 2 cards and places those faceup before them. The other 6 go into your hand.

Pick anyone to be start player.


## Objective

The game **ends** as soon as everyone's "die" ( = the cards in their hand) is completely empty. 

Count how much **health** each player has placed before them (indicated the heart icon on each card). Most health wins!


## Gameplay

From start player, take clockwise turns until done.

During the game, you'll build a row of faceup cards (from left to right) in front of you.

On your turn,

* **Roll your die.** That is, shuffle the cards in your hand and reveal a random card.
* Now check the first card in your row and **its effect**. Most of these effects modify your number if you decide to stop here. Because ...
* You may decide to **stop here** and use your current number + effect ... or you can **reroll**. 

Whenever you roll again, you apply the power of the _next_ card in your row. So after the second roll, you look at your _second card_. After the third roll, you check your _third card_, and so forth. 

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
The effect of your previous roll is simply completely forgotten, because you didn't stop there.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

If you run out of cards, you must stop rolling (and use your final result).

Now **attack**! Your **final value** (from your final roll + effect applied) determines the damage you do.

* Pick **another player**. If your damage is negative, however, **you attack yourself** (with the positive version of the number).
* **Remove cards** from the victim's row with a **combined health** equal to the damage you do. (You may remove _less_ than that, but never _more_.)
* You can never remove a player's final card.

Finally, add the card you "rolled" to the left or right of your row.

Next player's turn!

## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variants

For a **first game** (with new players),
* Consider starting players with fewer cards (for a quick intro game)
* And with as many "no special action"-cards as possible. 

For an even **simpler** game (perhaps to play with young children),
* Only include the cards with powers that change your number. These are easy to understand and remember when you can not read (well).
* Start with fewer cards, so the row of rerolls can't grow quite as long.
* (Optional: negative numbers simply do nothing. You can't attack yourself.)

For an even **tougher** game,
* When attacking another player, you can only ever remove **one card** (with a health below or equal to your damage).
* The only situation in which you may remove **two cards** (at most), is if your final attack is value 6 or higher.
* (Optional: you _can_ remove a player's final card, and it simply means they only get a single roll on their turns. Until their row has become longer, of course.)

For a **slightly different** game,
* Notice that all the cards show a faint _arrow_ pointing left or right. In this variant, that arrow becomes important!
* At the end of your turn, when adding a card to your row, the **arrow of the card where you stopped** determines where you must add it.
* In other words: If the arrow points left, add the final roll result to the left of your row. If it points right, add to the right.
* (Some special cards from expansions don't have this arrow. In that case, place the card at any end you want, as per the usual rules.)


### Expansion: Superpowers

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_superpowers.webp" alt="Example of using the new types of powers in action." >}}

This expansion adds more types of powers on cards.

* **Stopped?** triggers only if you stopped here (and didn't keep rolling). All cards in the base game are this type by default.
* **Passed?** triggers as soon as you decide to keep rolling after this one and _stays_ on future rolls.
* **Unseen?** triggers at the end of your turn if you never reached this card at all. This is always combined with a second effect of another type.


The _Unseen_ cards have an eye icon on them to make sure you don't forget them.

This expansion also adds _Shield_ cards (with a shield icon). When used, their protective effect is true until your next turn. It's recommended to _rotate the card sideways_ to remember this.
