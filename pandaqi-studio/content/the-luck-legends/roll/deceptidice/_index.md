The fonts used are **Brasspounder** (headings; multiple variations) and **Caslon Antique** (body text). Everything else is mine.

This idea spun off from an earlier Luck Legends game called _A Little White Die_. Both are based on the famous classic _Liar's Dice_. That other game is the most basic, simplest version of it. This game takes it into a more unique direction by combining bluffing and secret dice rolls with combinations that score higher and higher. Similar to poker hands, but simpler and more creative.

I basically developed it side-by-side with its twin game, knowing that merging the ideas would just be a convoluted mess. On their own, these are two simple but really effective games!

After playing 1 or 2 games, I highly recommend playing with some of the variants or expansions. I kept the base game dead simple: barely half a page of rules, little material. This makes it extremely easy to teach and play, but also too simplistic on (many) repeat plays, which is why you can spice it up with the expansions!

ALTERNATE NAMES: "Fortune Favors the Fire" (because alliteration and fire sounds like liar) or "Fortune Favors the Fibber" or "Fibber's Fortune" or "Truth & Dice"
