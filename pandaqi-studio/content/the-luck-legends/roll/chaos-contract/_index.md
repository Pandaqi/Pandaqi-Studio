## Background

This idea was originally one of the first Luck Legends games. I still believe it's one of the simplest when it comes to core rules, but the issue was that those _contract_ cards require _text to explain the contract_. Even if very simple, that still requires the players to be old enough to read (in English). Understanding how likely you are to pass a challenge, together or not, is another matter that younger players probably will not get.

That's why I eventually moved this game a bit further into the project. I created code to randomly generate a set of varied and balanced contracts, so if you press that button (instead of downloading my premade PDF), you get a completely unique game every time!

And as I worked more on it, the title _Chaos Contract_ came to me, and the theme slowly shifted to something like "making a deal with the devil". Every turn, you try to succeed at some improbable challenge by rolling dice, and you'll often take other players with you in the fall---or success, of course.
