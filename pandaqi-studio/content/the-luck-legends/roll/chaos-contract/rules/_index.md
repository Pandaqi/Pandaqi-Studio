## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" alt="Example of how to setup the game." >}}

Create a deck of **Contract Cards**. Place 5 of them faceup on the table.

Deal all players a deck of **6 Dice Cards**: numbered 1--6, where 2 of them have an action.



## Objective

The game **ends** when a player has scored **6(+) contracts**. They win.


## Gameplay

On your turn, pick one [Contract](#contracts) from the center of the table. (Then refill to 5 from deck.)

Every contract poses a **challenge**. You may decide to go it alone ... but you'll usually want other players to help. You can **ask** as many (or as few) as you like, but it's up to them if they accept or not.

The _players_ who enter the contract are called **Souls**. The _number_ of them is called the **Turnout**.

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay.webp" alt="Example of how to take a turn; pick a contract, try it, succeed or fail." >}}

Then, **execute the challenge**, doing as it says. 
* Players take turns rolling, in clockwise order, starting from the active player.
* If you must roll multiple times, keep previous results _out of your deck_. (To remember what they were.)

Some cards have **special powers**: 
* These powers trigger immediately once rolled ( = revealed). 
* These powers **only work if you're not alone**. (They generally act on other Souls, not yourself.)

If you pass the challenge on the contract, you get the reward listed. Otherwise you get the penalty.

Crucially, the **reward or penalty is always multiplied by the Turnout**. For example, a reward of "+1 hand card" turns into "+3 hand cards" if the Turnout was 3.

You decide **how to distribute** the reward/penalty over all Souls. The only thing you **can't** do, if Turnout > 1, is give **everything** to one Soul (such as yourself). You can be quite selfish ... but it might come back to bite you later.

That's it!


## Contracts

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="contracts.webp" alt="All the properties of a contract card and how to read/use them." >}}

The challenge of a contract is written in the center. They are randomly generated (in a smart way), which is why there's no full list detailing all of them.

The contract's **reward** is within the green zone at the top. Its **penalty** is within the red zone at the bottom.

Any score/cards removed or gained are **shown** to the rest of the table.

There are only two possible penalties/rewards.


**SCORE (Get/Lose)**: You need these to eventually win the game.
* If you _get score_, it means grabbing a Contract card and placing it facedown in your score pile. The first card scored is always the contract you just played; any more contracts for scoring are simply drawn from the deck.
* If you _lose_ score, it means removing a random Contract card from your score pile and shuffling it back into the deck.

**CARD (Get/Lose)**: Use these to change your cards and what you can or can't roll.
* If you _get card_, draw a card from the deck into your hand.
* If you _lose card_, discard any card from your hand.


## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variants

To make the game **easier**, only select the 1-star and maybe 2-star contracts.

To make the game more **cooperative**, you must always try a challenge with at least 2 players. (The first player you pick is forced to cooperate with you.) However, a forced player does _not_ get a penalty if it goes wrong.

To make the game more **chaotic**, start every player with 6 random cards (instead of neatly ordered numbers).

To **vary the objective**,
* Instead of counting every contract as being worth 1, every contract is worth as many points as the _number of stars_ on it.
* The game ends as soon as somebody has accumulated **12(+) stars** (over all their scored contracts).
* They win!


### Expansion: Lost Souls

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_lost_souls.webp" alt="Example of the two new types of contracts in this expansion." >}}

This expansion adds a few contracts that play with our Souls.

**FORCED:** This contract has a _minimum Turnout_. Until you've reached that number, you force other players to join in. (You can exceed it, but then it's voluntary again.)

**BATTLE:** This contract is a challenge _against_ each other. You select another player, who can't refuse, and you _both_ do the contract. 


In this case, it's **not** a test that you either fail or don't. Instead, both players must simply **do better** at the challenge than the other, or they lose. The winner gets the reward; the loser gets the penalty.

Other players are allowed to voluntarily **join** the battle too (if they think they can beat you). If so, take turns between all participating players, in clockwise order. Multiple winners (in case of a tie) are fine.


### Expansion: Devilish Numbers

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_devilish_numbers.webp" alt="Example of the special number cards (wildcard / duo) from this expansion." >}}

This expansion adds a few new number cards.

* **Wildcard**: is any number you want, at any time.
* **Duo**: has two numbers. Pick the one you want after revealing it. (Once chosen, it can't change anymore)

It also adds a few more special powers and higher/lower numbers in general.
