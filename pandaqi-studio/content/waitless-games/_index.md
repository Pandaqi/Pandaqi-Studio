All the games are unique: new rules, new art style, new material, new ideas.

Their one thing in common, though, is that they are **"waitless"**. Designed to be played in waiting rooms, queues, rooms without a table or chairs, quick moments of downtime, etcetera.

* You can start or stop them incredibly quickly.
* Little material and all of it can be held in hands at all times.
* Rounds are very fast, often even "simultaneous".
* You will not look silly or annoy others around you while playing.

_Great! When are new games added?_ Currently, I have ~6 ideas, of which ~2 new ones will be added each year.

## Background

It is not hard to guess where these ideas came from. Waiting in line at a theme park is never fun---why not play a game? I have, unfortunately, spent a lot of time waiting in the hospital, or living in a situation where a traditional game just can't be played. Is it really that hard to design (board) games you _could_ do in that moment?

And thus the journey started. It started with a game that ended up being simple and good, but not entirely Waitless: it needed too much setup and material for that. (I am talking about _Kingseat_, and have since moved this category of games to the [Throneless Games](/throneless-games/) project.)

That "failed attempt", however, showed me what I did wrong and how I had to approach these games in a different way. Once I figured that out, the ideas and their feasibility improved. 

## Credits

Because all games are completely unique in their gameplay, there are no shared images or fonts. For detailed credits, you'll have to check out the page for a specific game.

Some images were generated using AI. I generally use open source and free fonts, though I sometimes make one myself. Everything else---code, assets, ideas, rules, this website---is all mine.
