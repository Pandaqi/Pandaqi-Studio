Click the "Download" button and pick one of the PDFs I already generated for you. Print and play!

Rules are explained on the board itself.

You can also [generate random boards](board) with custom settings.

## Clarifications

Yes, you really play with your hands! And yes, that means you might physically get in each other's way, and people with large hands naturally have a slight advantage, and after a while you'll need to move your head to see some obscured squares.

This game isn't a 1-hour long tactical battle---it's a fun game to play in ten minutes that needs _no_ other preparation or material whatsoever.

Boards are as balanced and pretty as I can make them (through random generation code). If you don't like the look of one, however, or think it's unbalanced, just press the button again to generate another! It's free! And fast!

To make sure we're all on the same page, here is an image of how a single hand might be placed and how to score it (at the end of the game.)

At the end, you might want to take a picture (from above) or write down the fingers for each player on another paper. Especially if you have many players (4+), it can be tiring to keep your hand in a difficult position for a long time, or very hard to verify scores from your own perspective.

## Credits

I've used the fonts **Cherry Bomb One** (headings, thick) and **Quicksand** (body, thin). They are both freely available from Google Fonts.

Everything else (idea, code, assets) are completely mine, with the exception of some ingredient and machine illustrations. For those a generative AI was used, although they were often (heavily) edited afterwards to keep a consistent style.
