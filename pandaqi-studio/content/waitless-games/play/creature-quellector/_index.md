**DISCLAIMER: Creature names are randomly generated** from a huge list of words and phrases. This means there might be "unfortunate" combinations such as "childkill", which I just can't prevent 100%. I hope we can all see the humor in silly random names!

## Waitless Games?

This game is part of a genre I invented which I call "waitless games" or "queuing games".

What does that mean?

* You don't need a table, chairs, or much space at all.
* The game requires very little material.
* Rounds are fast and can be started/paused/ended at an instant.
* (If possible, turns happen simultaneously so you literally don't need to wait.)

In other words, take this game with you wherever you go. Whenever you have to wait for something, stand in line, have some downtime ... play it!

## Background

This game started when I had a discussion with somebody about how _annoying_ it is to _wait_ and do _nothing_! Especially in theme parks, where waiting might mean "standing for 2 hours doing nothing in a tight space".

I thought: "wouldn't it be possible to create a _queuing game_? What would that look like?"

This was my first attempt. (Well, actually my second, but the first one turned into something with slightly too many cards to play comfortably in a tight space.) I realized I needed a ...

* Small deck
* Big cards, preferably with no text, so easy to read in any circumstance.
* No "discarding", "drawing" or "playing" of cards (as that requires a table or extra space)
* Something in which the specific cards in your hand, or their order, doesn't really matter. (This makes it easy to immediately pause the game by just putting the cards in your pocket or something.)

After a long process of brainstorming and experimenting, this game was the result.

## Credits

Obviously, the aesthetic and rules were very much inspired by Pokémon (and similar card collection games). I tried to make it more unique, but hey, there's a reason Pokémon is as popular as it is ;)
