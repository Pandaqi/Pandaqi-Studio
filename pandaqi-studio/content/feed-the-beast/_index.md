## Background

Besides making games, I am a writer, most notably of the _Wildebyte Arcades_: a series of stories about somebody stuck _inside_ video games. As I was planning many (many) books ahead, I wanted to write down some general plot idea for a Pokémon-parody story. When I woke up the next day, my brain was like "what if there's this HUGE creature blocking an important path, and they have to satisfy it/lure it away/whatever by giving it the gifts it wants?"

That sounded like a game! There's a monster with food preferences, players get rewarded for giving the right thing (or punished for giving the wrong thing), and the first player to get rid of all their tokens wins.

Then I made that game, and it became the _Feed the Beast_ you see now, with relatively minor changes. It's just a very simple but strong core mechanic, easy to dress up and make more interesting by giving every monster _unique powers and preferences_. (Coming up with 20 unique beasts to play was frankly most of the work.)

The second part of that original idea---the fact that the monster might be guarding something, like the typical "princess locked in a tower"---was eventually moved to an expansion to keep the base game simple.

## Credits

The fonts used are **Getronde** (headings, rough and grungy, but not so rough it's unreadable) and **IBM Plex Serif** (body, longer paragraphs, highly readable). Generative AI was used for the big monster illustrations and food tokens, everything else is mine.
