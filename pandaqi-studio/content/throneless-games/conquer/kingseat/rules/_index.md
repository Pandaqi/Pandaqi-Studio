## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image src="starting_setup_1.webp" alt="Example starting setup (for four players)." class="float-right" >}}

Pick (at least) as many Princes as there are players. Add all their cards to the deck and shuffle. Now deal equally many cards to each player ( = their **Hand**). Any leftover cards are shown and go into the Tell.

Pick a _position_. This is the "Kingseat". Whoever sits (or stands) there, is the _King_. 

Players exchange some cards to design the Hand they want.

* Each player gives **two Hand cards** to the player on their right (simultaneously).
* Each player gives **two Hand cards** to the player on their left (simultaneously).
* Each player picks **one Hand card** and puts it away somewhere safe. This is their secret **Loyalty**

Finally, keep two piles of cards during the game.

* A facedown pile of votes (the **Tell**).
* A faceup pile of discarded cards (the **Discard**)


## Objective

{{< rules-image-sidebar src="objective.webp" alt="Example counting the votes and declaring a winner (at the end)" >}}

The game ends when **all players are out of cards**. 

Reveal the **Tell** and count the votes. The Prince with the most votes wins. All players whose secret **Loyalty** matches that Prince, win!

## Gameplay

Rounds are played _simultaneously_. They have two simple phases: **Give Cards** and **Vote**.

**Give Cards**: all players give away 1 card to their neighbor. The direction alternates between left neighbor and right neighbor (per round).

**Vote:** all players secretly pick a card from their Hand ( = their Vote).

* Once everyone is ready, reveal the cards.
* The Prince with the **most votes** wins.
* **Tied?** The one closest to the Kingseat, looking in clockwise order, wins.

All winning cards go into the Tell.

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay_1.webp" alt="Example of step 1 of each round: vote, check, add winning votes to Tell." >}}

For each remaining card, the player gets a choice. (Do this from Kingseat, clockwise, until all cards are gone.)

* Either **execute the action** on your card.
* Or **swap places** with another player and **swap 1 Hand card** with them.

Either way, add the card to the Discard.

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay_2.webp" alt="Example of step 2 of each round: non-winning players either execute their card action, or swap places." >}}

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Remember that Kingseat is a **position**. Whoever sits there, is currently king. As such, when they swap places, they do not remain king.

Bluffing, making deals, lying, it's all very much allowed. That's it! Have fun!

## Packs

The packs below are _roughly_ in the order recommended. Further down the list, Princes are more complicated or less balanced. For your first game(s), pick the first few Princes.

Do **not** include two Princes of same or similar color in the same game, if possible. Such Princes do similar things and will lead to unbalanced or confusing games if both are included.

Each Prince has two "Dark cards". Each has a unique action that is often more powerful. They're important for balancing each Prince, but _can_ be left out if so desired.

The cards **explain themselves**. The overview below exists to help you make a decision or clarify potential rule misunderstandings.
