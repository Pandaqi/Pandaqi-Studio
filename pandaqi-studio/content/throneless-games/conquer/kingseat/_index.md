When generating material yourself, check the rules to see **how many Princes** are recommended for each player count. Each choice adds ~1 page to print.

## Background

As stated on that page, this was the very first entry in the Throneless Games! It was also one of the very first games that could be _generated_ right on this website. Because it was my first attempt, I knew it had mistakes and possible improvements, which is why I immediately planned to return a year later to "finish" the Throneless Games.

I'm glad I did, because simply returning with 1 more year of game development experience changed the entire game for the better. (Though that single year did contain the creation of 30+ games, so some improvement was to be expected :p)

The original version was fine, but lacked simple professional polish on the card design and game core. The second version feels like one of my simplest games that still has a lot of depth. (Even though it sailed past its original objective of being a [Waitless Game](/waitless-games/), meaning you really have to play Kingseat at a table with chairs, otherwise it's just impractical.)
