The cards contain text. However, this text is simple and consistent ( = the same for each card of that animal), so you can explain them beforehand if some players can't read (English).

When generating material yourself, check the rules to see **how many Animals** are recommended for each player count. Each choice adds ~1 page to print.

## Background

After making the first game ([Kingseat](/throneless-games/conquer/kingseat)), I saw that the idea could really go in two directions. It could be simplified even further, or it could receive a few more mechanics to make it a deeper strategical game. (Kingseat kind of hovered between the two, which is why it's a mid-game of the project.)

Smallseat was that simplest version. I tried, in every possible way, to minimize rules and requirements (material needed, space needed, etcetera). 

So what's different in this version?

* There is no Discard or Vote pile (for which you would need a table or similar). Instead, one _player_ holds the votes cast in their hand, while also playing themselves.
* Animals have fewer cards that always have the exact same action. (No Dark Actions, no variation, shorter games, easier to remember.)
* Both of these things simplify setup and gameplay even more, at the slight cost of the action text usually requiring a few more words.
* The graphic design is cuter and more aimed at kids.
