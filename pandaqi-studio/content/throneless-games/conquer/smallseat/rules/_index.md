## Setup

Pick as many unique **Animals** as the **number of players**. Add all their cards to the deck, then shuffle.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
You CAN include more animals; this makes the game longer and harder.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

Pick a player: they become the **Teller**. 

* Their current position ( = where they sit/stand) is called the **Smallseat**.
* They publicly call out **one Animal** before the game starts. 
* They start _without cards_, but will receive more and more as the game progresses.

All other players are **Candidates**. Deal the deck to the candidates until empty, as fairly as possible. Any remaining cards go to the Teller.

Card facing is important in this game. From now on, hand cards that face towards yourself are called **secret cards**. Cards that face away (to the _other players_) are **public cards**. 

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Whenever you receive cards and it's not specified how to hold them (secret or public), you decide yourself.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

During the game, whoever sits at the Smallseat position is called the **Boss**.

## Objective

{{< rules-double-view src="objective.webp" alt="Example of counting the votes and declaring a winner (at the end)." >}}

The game ends once **no Candidate can vote anymore**.

Count the **secret cards** in the Teller's hand. The animal that appears **most often** wins. (This can be multiple animals.)

* If this was the animal that the Teller called out at the start, _they win alone_!
* Otherwise, each player whose _final card_ is the same as the _winning animal_, wins!

## Gameplay

Gameplay happens in rounds, played _simultaneously_. 

Each round,

* The Teller votes first by playing a faceup Hand card.
* Then, all Candidates who have **more than 1 Hand card**, pick a secret card simultaneously.
* You _must_ play the same type as the Teller, if you can.
* You can only disobey---and play any vote you want---by giving away one card of yours. This payment is done _after_ revealing votes.

When done, reveal all votes.
* The Animal with the **most votes** wins.
* **Tied?** The one closest to Smallseat, in clockwise direction, wins.

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay_1.webp" alt="Example of voting in a round, then handling who won the vote." >}}

All votes for this winning animal go into the **Teller's hand** (secret).

For each remaining card, the player gets a choice. (Do this from Smallseat again, clockwise, until all cards are gone.)

* Either **execute** the action on your card,
* Or **swap places** with another player.

Whatever happens, the card played goes into the **Teller's hand** (public).

That's it!

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Remember that Smallseat is a **position**. Whoever sits there, is currently Boss. As such, when they swap places, they do not remain Boss.

## Packs

Below is an overview of all different Animals in the game. It's roughly sorted based on how difficult the card's actions are to understand.

It's recommended to **not** include two Animals of **similar color** in the same game. They have similar actions and might make the game monotone.

The cards **explain themselves**, but the overview below contains clarifications or extra details.
