## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image src="starting_setup_1.webp" alt="Example starting setup (for four players)." class="float-right" >}}

Pick as many Princesses as the number of players. Add all of them to the deck, shuffle, and deal fairly.

Pick any player: their position is the **Queenseat** (and whoever sits there is called the **Queen**).

Card facing is important in this game. From now on, hand cards that face towards yourself are called **secret cards**. Cards that face away (to the _other players_) are **public cards**.

You CAN include more animals; this makes the game longer and harder.

## Objective

The game ends once **nobody can Vote anymore**. Whoever **is the Queen** when that happens, **wins**!


## Gameplay

Gameplay happens in rounds.

Each round,
* All players pick a **secret card** from their Hand: their Vote.
* Once done, reveal these votes simultaneously.
* The Princess with the **most votes** wins.
* **Tied?** The one closest to Queenseat, going clockwise, wins.

The Queen gets 1 card of choice (as a **public** card). All winning voters may pick who receives their card, which can be themselves (**public**).

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay_1.webp" alt="Example of voting in a round, then checking who won and handling their cards." >}}

For each remaining card, the player must make a choice. (Handle this from the Queenseat again, in clockwise order, until all cards are gone.)

* Either execute the **action** on the card.
* Or **swap places** with another player.

The Queen decides who receives your card (**public**), but they can't pick themselves.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Remember that Queenseat is a **position**. Whoever sits there, is currently Queen. As such, when they swap places, they do not remain Queen.

There are, however, two wrinkles.

* You are **not** allowed to vote the type you see the **most** in your neighbor's hands. (Unless you have no choice.)
* You may only **swap places with the Queen** if they have **fewer** public cards of the **winning type** than you.

That's it! Have fun!

## Packs

Below is an overview of all different Princesses in the game. It's roughly sorted based on how difficult the card's actions are to understand.

It's recommended to **not** include two Animals of **similar color** in the same game. They have similar actions and might make the game monotone.

The cards **explain themselves**, but the overview below contains clarifications or extra details.

Whenever you **receive cards** for an action, you may _choose_ whether to make them public or secret. (Unless the action explicitly states what to do, of course.)
