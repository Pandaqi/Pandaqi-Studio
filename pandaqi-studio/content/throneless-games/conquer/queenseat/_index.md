When generating material yourself, check the rules to see **how many Princesses** are recommended for each player count. Each choice adds ~1 page to print.

## Background

This game was originally meant to have the "Seatcard" that is now the prominent part of Kaizerseat, and that would have been its only change. When coming back to the idea later, however, I realized this was too little variation. It made all the Throneless Games almost identical, just with different animal illustrations!

Thus I brainstormed longer and found more extreme (and interesting) twists on the core mechanic. For example, the _objective_ changed. Instead of winning if your animal collected the most votes, you win if you're sitting on the throne when the game ends. Despite the core rules staying the same, this new objective obviously changed the feel and actions of the entire game.

This made Queenseat probably the most unique entry in the Throneless Games. To keep it simple, nicely in the second spot based on complexity, the Seatcard idea then moved to Kaizerseat. (Along with some more complicated actions, because Queenseat still has only one _type_ of action.)
