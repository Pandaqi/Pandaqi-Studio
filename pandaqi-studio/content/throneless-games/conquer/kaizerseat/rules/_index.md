## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="starting_setup_1.webp" alt="Example of starting setup for 4 players. (Deal cards, pick Loyalty, prepare Thronecard and Tell/Discard.)" >}}

First, prepare the deck and Player hands.

* Pick as many Seekers as the number of players. Add them all to the deck, shuffle, and deal fairly.
* From these starting cards, each player sets aside 1 secret card: their **Loyalty**.

Then, prepare the special cards. 

* Place a shuffled deck of **Thronecards** and a deck of **Seatcards** _faceup_ on the table.
* Draw the top Thronecard: its special rule will be true for _the entire game_.

During the game, you'll track two piles. These should be handled by the Leader.

* A facedown pile holding all Votes (= **Tell**).
* A faceup pile holding all discarded cards ( = **Discard**)

Finally, pick a player. Their **position** is the "Kaizerseat" and whoever sits there is called "Leader".

## Objective

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="objective.webp" alt="Example of how to decide who won based on the final votes in the Tell." >}}

The game ends once **nobody can Vote anymore**.

Check the votes in the Tell. The Seeker with the most votes wins. Any player whose secret Loyalty matches a winning Seeker **wins the game**!

## Gameplay

Gameplay happens in rounds.

At the start of each round, draw the a **new Seatcard** ( = top card of the deck). Its special rule will be true _for this round only_.

The Leader decides this round's **direction**: _clockwise_ or _counter clockwise_.

Then,
* All players secretly pick 1 Vote from their hand. Once done, reveal all. 
* The Seeker with the **most votes** wins.
* **Tied?** The Seeker closest to the Leader, looking in the **direction** picked, wins.

All winning cards go into the Tell.

Now handle all remaining cards. (Do so starting from Kaizerseat again, going in the **direction** picked, until no cards are left.)

* Trigger the action written on the card.
* If the action **does nothing**, the player swaps places with another player.
* Add the card to the Discard.

That's it! Next round!

## Packs

Below is an overview of all different Seekers in the game. It's roughly sorted based on how difficult the card's actions are to understand.

It's recommended to **not** include two Seekers of **similar color** in the same game. They have similar actions and might make the game monotone.

The cards **explain themselves**, but the overview below contains clarifications or extra details.

There are 5 possible actions that can appear

* **When revealed:** triggers as soon as the card is shown. (Normally, it's when all the votes are revealed. In open rounds, this is when the card is *played*.) As such, these actions are taken _before_ checking who won.
* **When handled:** triggers as soon as the card is _handled_ during a round. (This category contains most cards.)
* **When Tell:** triggers when the card is inside the Tell. (Which influences the Vote count at the end.)
* **When won:** triggers when the card is part of the winning votes.
* **When hired**: these cards are placed permanently before you (faceup), granting a recurring special power the rest of the game. (Remember that this only happens if you did _not_ win the round, otherwise the card just goes away into the Tell.)
