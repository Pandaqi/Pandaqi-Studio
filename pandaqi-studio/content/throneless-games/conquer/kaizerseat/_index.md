When generating your own material, check the rules to see **how many Seekers ("packs")** are recommended for each player count. Each choice adds ~1 page to print.

## Background

Whenever I create a game, the idea always starts on a sort of middle ground and I usually try to _simplify, simplify, simplify_. I chuck out rules, I discard special actions that sound really cool but take 20 extra words to explain, etcetera.

The result are very simple and streamlined games such as Smallseat and Queenseat.

I have also learned, however, that those nice ideas can be brought back if you set up the game to be a little longer and more complex from the start. It's almost always possible to create one version that players _know_ will take longer to play and has a few more rules to learn, but which gives the coolest actions and deepest strategy in return.

As expected, this became Kaizerseat. About half of it is the result of discarded ideas that I pushed upstream, the other half unique mechanics and actions invented just for this version. For example, it contains a Seatcard that randomizes a few rules per game, and it has _multiple types of actions_. Both were ideas I'd originally given to other games, but which turned out to be slightly too much for those simple versions. So they ended up here!
