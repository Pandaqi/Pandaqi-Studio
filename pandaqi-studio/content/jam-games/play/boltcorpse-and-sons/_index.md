Congratulations! You are a new employee at **Boltcorpse & Sons**.

As we all know, vengeful ghosts are everywhere. They break into the palace now that they lack a physical body, and we've already lost nine of our kings this way. It's your incredibly important job to **defend against that**!

Unfortunately, though, our resources are limited. 

* You can only *look to one side at a time* (left or right) by pressing **Left Arrow/Right Arrow** (or **A** and **D**)
* You can only wear *one pair of glasses* to spot and destroy specific ghosts. Toggle between them by pressing **Up Arrow/Down Arrow** (or **W** and **S**), or its specific **number key**.

As you get further, more types of ghosts and glasses appear, with new properties or special effects. 

The longer you *stay in one view*, the bigger your range and damage. But don't let that distract you from checking out the other side too ...

Defend the palace! Or, well, just survive as long as you can. Those glasses were expensive.

{{% section-centered heading="Inspiration" %}}

This is my submission for the **Mini Jame Gam 33**. Its theme was **Behind You**, and the special object (you had to use somehow) was **Glasses**.

Recently, I read a few novels from the *Lockwood & Co* series. That's probably why this idea of fighting off ghosts with certain properties was my very first assumption when reading the theme. That's also why the game is called *Boltcorpse & Sons* ;)

I was also inspired by the *Weeping Angels* from Doctor Who. Those are evil spirits that only move when you're *not looking*. In other words, they're a statue when in front of you, but when behind you ...

The source code is available for free on GitHub: [Boltcorpse & Sons](https://github.com/Pandaqi/boltcorpse-and-sons/).

The game was made in **Godot 4.3**, its graphics in **Affinity Designer**, and all music a mix of **Audacity** and my crappy built-in microphone.
