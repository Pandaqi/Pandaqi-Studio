Run a (barebones, grid-based) potion shop with 1 to 4 players. 

The only problem? You all have a big **shadow** around you, hiding ingredients and orders near you from view! In fact, it even hides holes in the shop that kill you if you fall into them ...

Play through **20 quick levels, increasing in difficulty**. No tutorial needed; every level adds one new rule that's explained as you go.

Playable with **keyboard** (max 4 players on single keyboard) or **gamepad**.

Playable by anyone thanks to only a single button: **move around**. Nothing else needed!

Chaotic local multiplayer that requires great cooperation, memorization of where things are, staying on the move ... and not making a single misstep.

Made for the **Pirate Jam (2024)**, which means it's missing some polish and advanced features like saving runs.
