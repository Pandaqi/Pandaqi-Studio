You must defend your Treeheart in the center from animals who want to eat it. Fortunately, those animals also like eating other things: flowers.

When you put seeds **inside** your inventory, they start converting. Once done, they come **out** automatically. The terrain you're on at that moment determines which exact flower comes out. Hopefully, the one that will distract / remove the incoming animals. 

When you drop seeds **inside** the Treeheart chamber, they become bullets instead. An ... alternative method for defending nature, when all else fails.

Every wave unlocks a new animal or gives you a choice between powerups. The game explains itself as you go. If you survive 16 waves, you've completed the game. 

I guess you might say this is a ... **flower defense game**.

Have fun!

## Anything Else?

This was my submission for the **Do You Wanna Jam 2024!?**

When I saw the theme **Inside Out**, I envisioned a game where you were constantly eating stuff ( = shoving it **inside** your mouth), and then spitting it **out** as something else. It was about converting one type of candy to another type of candy by running around and eating it.

Sounded great---but I just couldn't find the game here. What would even be the objective? Isn't eat stuff->spit it out a pretty weird theme? I couldn't find a way forward, so I pivoted to this game. You grab seeds, wait for them to convert, them drop them as something else. And being inside or outside changes the rules for how that works.

A loooot of ideas were scrapped for time though, and some enemies might be ... less tested.
