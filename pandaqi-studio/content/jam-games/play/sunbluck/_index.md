**Keep your beach tourists in the shade!**

**Move, rotate and purchase parasols** to make sure none of the guests get sunburned. **Lure** tourists to the same spot to catch multiple in a single shadow, or hope the (un)fortunate appearance of a cloud saves you this time. Or maybe you can spare a parasol to keep a **powerup** in the shade long enough to activate it ...

Controls, objective, powerups---everything is **explained interactively** as you play.

Have fun!

## Anything Else?

This was my entry for the **Godot Wild Jam 72**. The theme was **Light and Dark**.

I originally had a very different idea. One that seemed really promising, so I'll probably still make it. But when I woke up to work on it ... I could barely move. It was the hottest day of the year (in the Netherlands). Even standing behind my desk and doing nothing was tough in that heat.

So I decided I was more motivated to work on this very thematic game idea.

Obviously, the entire core idea revolves around (sun)light and keeping tourists in the shade ( = dark). The ducks were one of the optional wildcards for the jam, as were the powerups/curses, though they only appear on a later day to keep the introduction simple.

The final version was exported with **Godot 4.3** that just released. (Before that moment, I used the release candidate for it.)

This game will probably receive local multiplayer in a later update, as well as some quality of life fixes and tiny ideas for which I didn't have time (such as throwing tourists in the water to cool them off :p).
