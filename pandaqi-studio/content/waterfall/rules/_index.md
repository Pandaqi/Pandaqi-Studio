## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" alt="Example game setup (for 2 players, to keep it simple)." >}}

Place any tile with the **add** (+) action facup on the table: this is the start of the waterfall.

Give all players **4 tiles** and **1 Pawn**. Everyone places the pawn above the waterfall.

The remaining tiles become the facedown draw pile.



## Objective

The game **ends** when when the waterfall **has 20(+) cards** or the **deck is empty** (rare). Sum your scored tiles: **highest score wins!**


## Gameplay

From start player, take clockwise turns until the game ends.

On your turn, you first **play cards** and then **fall down the waterfall**.

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay.webp" alt="Example of a simple turn: playing cards and then falling down that number of steps." >}}

**PLAY**: Play as many hand cards as you want. 

* Sum the _numbers_ on them. That is how many spaces you're allowed to fall.
* If you have **no** tile in hand, move a single space and draw a tile.

**FALL**: For every space you move, pick one of the positions _below_ your current tile (down left or down right).

* It has a tile? Execute its action!
* It's empty? You've exited the waterfall. Reset to the top; your turn is over.

You **can't** enter a tile that contains another player, _unless_ both your options are blocked.

## Actions

Everything in this game happens by executing a tile's action (when you visit it). The main actions are ADD, DRAW and SCORE.

{{< rules/rules-image src="tile_actions.webp" alt="Visual explanation of the three major actions: ADD, DRAW and SCORE." >}}

When you do an **ADD** action,
* Place 1 tile from your hand in the waterfall (a _pyramid_ shape).
* Adjacent to an existing tile.

The **DRAW** action allows drawing 3 cards from the top of the facedown deck, into your hand. If the deck runs out, shuffle the discarded tiles and make it the new deck.

The **SCORE** action works as follows. You may score at most _2 tiles_ this way (with one SCORE action).
* Check the _gemstones_ that you visited thus far (when falling down this turn).
* Pick a **tile from your hand** that has a _matching gemstone_. (If none exists, just do nothing.)
* Place that tile facedown in your score pile. Its _number_ scores you points at the end of the game.
