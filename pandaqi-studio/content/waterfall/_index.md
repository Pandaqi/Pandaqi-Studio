This game is _textless_ and incredibly _simple_ in its rules. It is suitable for kids, families, any group. 

For a heavier version of this idea (with way more actions, written on the tiles, and some other twists), visit the spin-off [Waterfall: Raging Rapids](/waterfall-raging-rapids/).

The fonts used are **Avrile Serif** (body, longer paragraphs, very readable) and **Merienda** (headings, short phrases, more curvy). Some generative AI was used for the action illustrations. Everything else is entirely mine.

This idea was cheekily called _"Decision Trees: The Game"_ for the longest time. That reveals how it started. I was looking into adding automatically generated decision trees to my rulebooks (because they are a _great_ help to new players for certain games), and suddenly realized that those trees kind of look like boards ... on which you can move around by following the connections ...

A few minutes later, I'd written down the first idea for "Waterfall". You simply fall down, getting a choice between LEFT or RIGHT every time, and the specific path you take obviously determines your actions and rewards. For more interactivity and challenge, other pawns _block_ paths if they stop on tiles.

The first version of this idea, as usual, was slightly more complicated (and text-heavy) than I'd like. I ended up renaming that original version to [Waterfall: Raging Rapids](/waterfall-raging-rapids/) and publishing it as a slightly "heavier" spin-off.

Also as usual, though, _after_ making something you realize the exact ways in which you can make it _better_ next time. And so I created a second version, which is the game you're visiting right now: _Waterfall_. A simpler, more streamlined, and textless version that better fits my original vision for the idea.
