## About This Game

This game is as a tiny card game using two innovative mechanics: the idea of _smuggling piles_ and a completely _dynamic market_
					
### Smuggling Piles

I wanted to make a game where you needed to smuggle one animal (= the unicorn) out of the city. To do so, however, you first had to succesfully fool or pass _all other players_. I think this mechanic was quite a good idea, although it took some time to figure it out, and I will use it more in the future.
					
### Dynamic Market

I also wanted a game where you could buy/sell animals, and their value would depend on the current market (just like, you know, in real life). This also works quite well, although I think it might have made the game more complex than needed.

### Errors? Feedback? Ideas?

This game underwent major changes along the way, which renders most of my old playtests obsolete. Additionally, it's not as "simple" as I wanted it to be.

If you spot any errors or have ideas for improvements, let me know.
