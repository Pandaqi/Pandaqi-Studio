Internet has disappeared. But the human need to socialize and relate has not.

**Letters against Loneliness** has one lonely rule and uses it for 100 simple, small, but captivating puzzles.

## How To Play?

**Objective?** Send a letter to each person in the puzzle.

**How?** Each move, you tap a single location to place a post office.

**And then?** A letter is sent between the new post office and any other post offices on the same line.

## Puzzles

The game has roughly **100 puzzles**, divided into **worlds**.

Each world introduces one new element (a new person, a new tile, anything) to gradually teach the game and increase complexity.

The simple objective and simple rule stay the same for the whole game, making it accessible to anyone. 

But once people with specific wishes appear, and the terrain turns into mountains, forests and buildings, finding the solution requires quite the Eureka!
