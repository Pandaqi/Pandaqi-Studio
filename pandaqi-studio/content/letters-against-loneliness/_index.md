**Objective?** Send a letter to each person in the puzzle.

**How?** Each move, you tap a single location to place a post office.

**And then?** A letter is sent between the new post office and any other post offices on the same line.

The game has roughly **100 puzzles**, divided into **worlds**.

Each world introduces one new element (a new person, a new tile, anything) to gradually teach the game and increase complexity.

The simple objective and simple rule stay the same for the whole game, making it accessible to anyone. 

But once people with specific wishes appear, and the terrain turns into mountains, forests and buildings, finding the solution requires quite the Eureka!
