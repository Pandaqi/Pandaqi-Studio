## Setup

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" >}}

Place 1 random card of each color in a 2x2 square on the table. This is the start of the (shared) **Map**.

Create a deck from all remaining cards.
* Deal each player **8 cards** (to take into their hand).
* Place the rest as a facedown draw pile to the side.



## Objective

The game ends when a player is **out of cards**. The number of **music notes** left in your hand represent your _negative points_.

It's recommended to play a few games in a row, keeping track of score. The player with the best score at the end ( = _least_ negative score) wins!


## Gameplay

{{< rules/rules-example id="turn" >}}

From start player, take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, **add 1 hand card to the Map**.

* The card must **connect** to the existing map.
* The card has to be in the **same row** (_horizontal, vertical or diagonal_) as another card of the same _color_.
* The card **can't be adjacent** to a card of the same _color_.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
In the rare case you can't play any card, draw 1 card from the deck.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

By doing so, you'll have created one or more "Pairs": your new card and the older ones of the same color (in the same row). All pairs created count.

Each Pair has two important properties.

* **(Number) Range**: all numbers between its _lowest_ number and its _highest_. (Example: a 2-6 Pair has range 3, 4, and 5.)
* **(Note) Difference**: subtract the _lowest_ number of notes from the _highest_. (Example: a 1-Note card and a 4-Note card have a difference of 3.)

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay_pair.webp" alt="Example of valid card placement and the pair you create from it." >}}

Now everyone _may_ **give you hand cards** that match these criteria:

* Its number is inside the _number range_ and it's the same _color_.
* Its _number of music notes_ is equal to the _note difference_.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Preferably, throwing happens while yelling "Fiddlefoo, a penalty card for you!" ;)
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

Take all cards received into your hand. If you _end your turn_ without any cards, the game ends (and you win). Have fun!

## Upgrades

Played the base game a few times and ready for more? Try these expansions and variants.

### Variant: Safesong

This expansion defines a third property that your Pairs have.

> **Distance**: how many other cards are in-between the two cards on the map.

First, change these existing rules.

* **Adjacency**: you _are_ allowed to play cards of the same color adjacent to each other now!
* **Map Size**: the map has a maximum size of 8 by 8 cards. Also, once somebody created a "Safesong" (see below), the affected rows are now "done": they can't grow any longer.

The following rules are required now.

* **Safesong:** if all Pairs you created have distance 3(+), you are safe! Nobody may throw anything at you.
* **Silence**: if you create a Pair with distance 0, players may throw any _single_ hand card at you.

The following rules are _optional_.

* **Toned Down**: if you create (at least) one Pair with distance 3(+), you may _choose_ what people are allowed to throw at you. (That is, they may only give cards based on _range_ OR _notes_ OR _distance_.)
* **Dissonance:** people may also throw cards at you if their _number_ or _number of notes_ matches the _distance_ you created. This rule _only applies if_, otherwise, no possible throwable card exists. (That is, the Range and Note Difference are both 0.)

{{< rules/rules-image src="variant_safesong.webp" alt="Example of the Distance property and the new rules it allows." >}}


### Variant: Wildcard

You might've noticed that the Purple color is a bit special. (It has fewer cards / numbers.)

If you play this Variant, the Purple color **becomes a wildcard!** It is any color you want. 

In practice, this means the following.

* If a wildcard number is inside the range somebody created, you can always throw it to them. (Even if their Pair used a different color.)
* If someone creates a Pair using wildcards, then you can throw _any_ card at them that has a number within its range.


### Variant: Cooperative

This Variant allows you to play the game _cooperatively_. (Everyone wins/loses together.)

What changes?
* During the game, you keep track of a single faceup pile of cards for each color, next to the board.
* Instead of throwing a card at another player, you may also decide to _add_ it to such a pile. You may only do so, however, if your number is higher than the current number at the top of the pile.
* The game ends when _all_ players have emptied their hand except one. You **win** if every faceup pile (next to the board) contains exactly 10 music notes.

{{< rules/rules-image src="variant_cooperative.webp" alt="Example of how to setup and play the cooperative variant (with slight modifications to base game)." >}}


### Expansion: Talkytoot

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" >}}

This expansion adds extra material: cards that also contain _special actions_. 

Such actions can trigger ...
* **When paired** (they are part of a Pair created this turn)
* **When thrown** (at another player)
* **When drawn** (from the deck)
* or **When Scored** (at the end of the game)

They usually allow you to do something you _really want to do_ but can't following the regular rules. Less likely, they are penalties or restrictions to obey.

It's recommended to include just _some_ of them---perhaps the one you like the most!---as all of them at the same time is very overwhelming.

There are two cards that mention _Distance_. Only include those if playing with the "Safesong" variant (see above).
