## Background

This game is pretty directly inspired by _Cabanga!_ After playing it, I immediately knew the core idea was solid and good. ("Play a card matching a card of the same color. This creates a range between those numbers; other players may throw away cards within that interval!") 

But I also thought it might be interesting to take the core idea in a slightly different direction. Add a bit more depth, reduce a bit of randomness, allow more player counts. After writing down my first idea and testing some paper prototypes, I found this new approach: play the cards to a shared _map_ and provide a _secondary_ way to gain/lose cards (reusing the music notes already on the cards).

All of that combined into the game Fiddlefoo! A simple and quick game that is surely distinct from its inspiration, in exactly the ways I was looking for.
