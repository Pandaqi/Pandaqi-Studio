By default, this game is completely offline: just download the material once, print it, and play.

It is highly recommended, however, to add a timer to rounds. You can use any timer or app, including my own [Pandaqi Timer](https://pandaqi.com/tools/timer) page.

The fonts used are **Frauces** (soft variation) for text and **Super Funtime** for headers. Everything else is mine.

This game is a sort of spiritual successor to my [That's Amorphe](https://pandaqi.com/thats-amorphe) games. I came up with the idea just as I was finishing the spin-off ([That's Amorphe Pictures](https://pandaqi.com/thats-amorphe-pictures)), but I had already committed to another project so I couldn't make it back then. 

Additionally, I ran into some problems I didn't know how to solve yet. Any creative idea starts out way more complicated and messy than the final product---simplifying and streamlining (game) ideas is perhaps the most important skill one can have.

This game takes the same idea of "communicate secret words/concepts in a vague and fun way", but puts a more precise and focused spin on it this time. The rules are even shorter and players who need a bit more certainty (instead of relying on creativity and inspiration) can find it in this game.

A simple, fast party game for any group!

For more details, as always, read the [devlog](https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/slippery-slopes).

**UPDATE!** This game now also has a completely _digital_ version. Playable with just one smartphone, rules explained as you go, still the same fun core mechanic. Try it at: [Slippery Slopes: Trippy Touches](https://pandaqi.com/slippery-slopes-trippy-touches).
