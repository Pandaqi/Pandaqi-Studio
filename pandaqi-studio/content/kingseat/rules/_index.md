Setup for a new game has three easy steps.

{{% rules-block id="setup_kingseat" heading="Pick the Kingseat" %}}

Pick a _position_. This is the "Kingseat". Whoever sits (or stands) there, is the _king_. 

* Assign one player to keep the pile with votes during the game ( = the **Tell**).
* Assign another player to keep the discard pile ( = the **Discard**).

{{< rules-image src="starting_setup_1.webp" alt="Example starting setup (for four players)." class="float-right" >}}

_You_ decide the number of Princes and the Hand size! Some recommendations for a first game:

* Include (slightly) fewer Princes than players.
* A good Hand size is ~8 cards.
* Include equally many cards for each Prince

{{% remark %}}
A bigger hand means a longer and more strategical game. The recommended Hand size means ~15 minutes of playtime.

Shuffle the deck you created. Then deal equally many cards to each player ( = their **Hand**). Any remaining cards are shown and go into the Tell.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block id="setup_loyalty" heading="Pick your best Hand" %}}

Finally, players exchange some cards to design the Hand they want.

* Each player gives **two Hand cards** to the player on their right (simultaneously).
* Each player gives **one Hand card** to the player on their left (simultaneously).
* Each player picks **one Hand card** and puts it away somewhere safe. This is their secret **Loyalty**

{{% rules-block id="objective" heading="Objective" icon="objective" icontint="orange" %}}

{{< rules-double-view src="objective.webp" alt="Example counting the votes and declaring a winner (at the end)" >}}

The game ends when all players are out of cards. 

Reveal the **Tell** and count the votes. (Each card is 1 vote.) The Prince with the most votes wins. All players whose secret **Loyalty** matches that Prince, win!

{{< /rules-double-view >}}

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block id="action_play" heading="Gameplay" icon="action" class="force-page-break-before" icontint="purple" %}}

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

Rounds are played _simultaneously_. All players secretly pick a card from their Hand and stick it out in front.

Once everyone is ready, reveal the cards. Starting from Kingseat, clockwise, check the votes.

> The winner of this round is the first Prince with the **longest sequence of votes**

All cards from that sequence go into the Tell.

{{< rules-image src="gameplay_1.webp" alt="Example of step 1 of each round: vote, check, add winning votes to Tell." >}}

Now handle all remaining cards. (The votes that did **not** go into the Tell.) Starting from Kingseat, clockwise, go around the table until all cards are gone. 

Each player has a choice.

* Either **execute the action** on your card.
* _Or_ **swap places** with another. (Take all your cards with you.)

Either way, add the card to the Discard.

{{< rules-image src="gameplay_2.webp" alt="Example of step 2 of each round: non-winning players either execute their card action, or swap places." >}}

{{% remark %}}
Remember that Kingseat is a **position**. Whoever sits there, is currently king. As such, when they swap places, they do not remain king.
{{% /remark %}}

Bluffing, making deals, lying, it's all very much allowed. That's it! Have fun. 

<!---
 A player can't change places more than once per round. 

 {{% remark class="right" %}}
So yes, if a previous player already swapped with you, you must execute the action when your turn comes.
{{% /remark %}}

Rounds alternate between **public** and **secret**. In public rounds, everything is the same, but ...

* Players vote in turn (starting from Kingseat, clockwise)
* And simply show their vote publicly

The first round is public.

{{% rules-block id="packs" heading="Packs" class="force-page-break-before" icon="expansion" icontint="orange" %}}

The packs below are _roughly_ in the order recommended. Further down the list, Princes are more complicated or less balanced. For your first game(s), pick the first few Princes.

Do **not** include two Princes of same or similar color in the same game, if possible. Such Princes do similar things and will lead to unbalanced or confusing games if both are included.

Each Prince has two "Dark cards". Each has a unique action that is often more powerful. They're important for balancing each Prince, but _can_ be left out if so desired.

The cards **explain themselves**. The overview below exists to help you make a decision or clarify potential rule misunderstandings.

<!---
Some cards have special actions, indicated above the text.

* (@TODO: ICON?) "When played" means you must execute the action when playing the card. 
* (@TODO: ICON?) "When revealed" means you must execute the action when the card is revealed.
* (@TODO: ICON?) "When Tell" means the action activates when the Tell is counted at the end of the game.

All of these mean that you **don't** get to swap places, as you've "decided" to execute the action.
