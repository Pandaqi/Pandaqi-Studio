Create two shuffled, facedown decks: one with the large **Word Tiles** (10 words), one with the smaller **Cave Drawings** (a single drawing).

Place the **Choice Tokens** (number + color) within easy reach.

On your turn, 
* Draw 1 random **Word Tile** and display it for everyone to see. They show **10 words** (numbered and colored).
* Draw 10 random **Cave Drawings**.
* Pick a **Choice Tile**. 

Now set a [timer](https://pandaqi.com/tools/timer/) for 60 seconds and start it!

Choice Tiles show a number and a color: _those are the two words you must communicate!_
* You may only use Cave Drawing tiles, no other communication.
* You can reveal up to 5 drawings.
* You can reveal them in any way (all at once, one at a time, in a neat row, some stacked on top of others, etcetera). Once a drawing is set in stone, however, it can't be moved or changed.

Once the other players want to make their guess, they _say_ and _tap_ the 2 words on the word card.
* **Both correct?** You score 10 points, minus how many symbols you revealed.
* **Otherwise?** Your turn is over and you score 0 points.

Finally, some remarks for clarity.
* If the timer runs out (without a guess), you instantly lose the round.
* If there's a disagreement, the player to the _left_ of the current communicator has the final say.
* Your number and color might fall on the same word. If so, simply communicate that single word, and you win if the _first guess_ by the others matches that word.

Once you know the base game, try these variants to suit the game more to your group's needs.

To make the game **harder**, 
* Pick your Choice Token _before_ drawing your Cave Drawings. (Or draw it randomly.)
* Only draw 6 Cave Drawings, and you may only reveal 3 of them. 

To make the game **easier**, 
* Only pick _one_ word. (Either the number OR the color on the Choice Token.)
* Limit the words you may pick from on each card. (For example, you may only pick from the first 6 options.)

To make the game **competitive**,
* Split into two teams.
* Each round, both teams get a turn communicating and guessing. The two communicators sit on the same side.
* However, only draw 1 Word Tile and 10 Cave Drawings for the entire _round_. The second team in the round may only use the drawings that the first team _didn't use_!
* The communicators must show the Choice Token they picked to each other.
* The team that scored the least points starts the next round.

To add more **choice during your turns**, and protection against "a bad hand",
* You're allowed to discard all unused Cave Drawings and draw equally many new ones from the deck.
* But if you do so, you must also draw another Choice Token and communicate _those words_ as well.
* As usual, you only score points if the others guess _all_ words correctly. But if they do, the points are doubled as a bonus!

If you've played the game _so much_ that you know all the Choice Tokens and/or Word Cards by heart, then ...
* Firstly, congratulations!
* Create two separate decks of Choice Tokens. Draw one from each: use the _number_ from each token (ignore color) to decide what to communicate.
* Generate a new set of word cards (and enable "tough words") from the website.
