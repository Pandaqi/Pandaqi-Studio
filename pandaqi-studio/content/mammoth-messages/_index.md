**Remark:** Generating the material for this game is pretty hard and takes a while. Please use a computer (not a phone) and give it a few minutes!

## Background

This game was just a simple idea I wanted to quickly create. A party game where you had to communicate words using rudimentary cave drawings? Sounded like it could work, so I didn't linger and just made it. 

(It originated as a possible party game to play on the computer, where everyone connected using their phone. I might still make that, with the same name and graphics, at some later date. Because I recently figured out how I can create and provide such play-with-your-phone games for free!) 

The key word here is simplicity. Anybody can play this game within 30 seconds. It's a great quick party game that combines language and visual creativity, which makes it a good fit for just about any group. At the same time, there isn't any more depth or strategy underneath it all.

You also might wonder "aren't some of these cave drawings a little too modern?" Well, while writing and researching my [Saga of Life](https://thesagaoflife.com) stories (about human history and origins of life), I repeatedly realized that just because they could not _write_ doesn't mean they didn't have clothes, tools, games, etcetera. We might have invented the knitting needle before any other tool. Dice, and what could possibly be betting chips, have been found on very old archeological sites. 

Their understanding of the world, their _spoken_ language, might have been on par with ours. Because why wouldn't it be? The prehistoric times lasted waaay longer than our modern times. They actually lived in nature and had to use and understand it every day. Science even shows they were healthier and more creative than modern day humans in some respects.
