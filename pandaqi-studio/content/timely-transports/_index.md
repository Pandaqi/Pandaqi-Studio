**Lead a transport company in the jungle!** 

Bamboo, birds, bees, anything can appear. Deliver it to the right city for points.

Moving a vehicle? Start a timer! Your movement is done when it runs out. But forget about it ... and you'll face the consequences.

Your vehicle is idling on a city when another player arrives? It's bumped off the board! 

Keep all your vehicles going, all the time, and you might just win!

## What do I need?

The game is played on a **physical** board with pieces to move around, but the timers (and more) are controlled by your **smartphone**. Each player needs to have a smartphone with them.

Print the following files. (Use the "Download" button.)

* Two pages of materials ( = the vehicles and resource chips).
* The rules---including images, setup and examples---are only three pages.
* You can print any of the pre-made boards, or use the [board generator](board) to create a random one just for you!

Then use this website: each player visits the [game](game) section to play.

## Remarks

The **campaign** has six scenarios, increasing in difficulty, allowing you to get comfortable with the game before adding new rules and mechanics.

When generating a board, the **split board** option is highly recommended! It creates a huge board consisting of 4 papers, which allows everyone around a table to easily reach all destinations.

When playing, **Don't** tap to start on your device until all players are ready!

Because it opens a new page, your browser might register this as a pop-up. It's not, I would never show pop-ups.

## Background

I've written two in-depth articles about the creation of this game (as I usually do):
* [(Devlog) Timely Transports](/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/devlog-timely-transports): about problems I faced, solutions I found, why I chose to do certain things (or not do them), general interesting stuff about game design.
* [(Technical Devlog) Timely Transports](/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/tech-devlog-timely-transports): about the actual algorithms used for the game interface and generating the game board, both high overview and actual code samples
* [(Update) Timely Transports](/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/update-timely-transports): about the huge update I did for the game, half a year after release. Why I did it, what changed, and more.
