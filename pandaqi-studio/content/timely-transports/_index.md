{{% boardgame-intro heading="" img="timelytransports_header_faded" %}}

A hybrid board+smartphone game for 1&ndash;8 players about transporting exotic goods across the jungle.

{{% /boardgame-intro %}}

<!-- Introduction + explanation text -->
{{% section-centered heading="What do I do?" %}}

**Lead a transport company in the jungle!** Bamboo, birds, bees, anything can appear. Deliver it to the right city for points.

Moving a vehicle? Start a timer! Your movement is done when it runs out. But forget about it ... and you'll face the consequences.

Your vehicle is idling on a city when another player arrives? It's bumped off the board! 

Keep all your vehicles going, all the time, and you might just win!

{{% section-centered heading="What do I need?" %}}
The game is played on a **physical** board with pieces to move around, but the timers (and more) are controlled by your **smartphone**. Each player needs to have a smartphone with them.

Print these files. (Use the "Download" button.)
- Two pages of materials ( = the vehicles and resource chips).
- The rules &mdash; including images, setup and examples &mdash; are only three pages.

Use this website
- Scroll down to the [generator](#board) to print a game board.
- Each player visits the [game](#game) section to play.

The **campaign** has six scenarios, increasing in difficulty, allowing you to get comfortable with the game before adding new rules and mechanics.

  <p>Input your desired settings. Click "generate board" until you get one you like.</p>
  <p>The "split board" option is highly recommended! It creates a huge board consisting of 4 papers, which allows everyone around a table to easily reach all destinations.</p>

Website (boards and game)? The **Phaser 3** library for programming, also completely free and open source.

Everything else (concept, code, graphics, rules, ...) was completely made by me, Pandaqi! I've written two in-depth articles about the creation of this game (as I usually do):
- [[Devlog] Timely Transports](/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/devlog-timely-transports): about problems I faced, solutions I found, why I chose to do certain things (or not do them), general interesting stuff about game design.
- [[Technical Devlog] Timely Transports](/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/tech-devlog-timely-transports): about the actual algorithms used for the game interface and generating the game board, both high overview and actual code samples
- [[Update] Timely Transports](/blog/boardgames/timely-transports/update-timely-transports): about the huge update I did for the game, half a year after release. Why I did it, what changed, and more.
