## Background

This idea is a kind of "twin" of [Six of Sparrows](/chiptales/bet/six-of-sparrows/). The two were originally one merged idea, which I split when I realized that would be far better and simpler to play.

That original idea came to me when I stumbled upon an older classic card game called Tichu. In it, players receive their cards "staggered": first you get X cards, then you may bid, then you get the rest of your cards. If you bid early, of course, you're rewarded with far more points---but it's risky, without knowing the other half of your cards!

I continued developing that idea, streamlining how scoring works, adding some more spice, until I ended up with a strong---if somewhat convoluted---idea. That's when I split it into two. 

* Bidding Blocks is all about _interaction between players_, while Six of Sparrows is more _individualized pattern matching_.
* Bidding Blocks is very simple to learn if you have _any_ experience with classic card games or trick-taking games. If not, Six of Sparrows is easier to try first.

Pick whichever one you like best!

## Maybe Don't Print Anything!

**This game can be played with a standard deck of cards.** Just read the rules and use numbers 1--10 of a standard deck. Decide which of the suits (hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds) maps to which of the suits in the game (floors, walls, stairs, roofs). And you're good to go!
