Pirate Riddlebeard hid a treasure in one square of the map. He left behind a set of unique hints leading to it.

But each player only receives part of that list! Figure out what the other pirates know, without giving away your own information.

Find the treasure before the others!

## What do I need?

Three steps.
* Read the rules. (Click the "Download" button. Base game is two pages.)
* Grab some pens and papers.
* Start the [game](game) on your phone and play!

**Phone?** You only need a device (and internet) at the start to generate a new game. Once setup is done, you can put it away.

**Offline version?** Also available in the rulebook.

## Background

**Is this magic!?** Nope, it's an algorithm. It generates a map and hints that, when combined, point to precisely one location. Most of the work actually went into balancing and finetuning: making the maps pretty and easy to look at, ensuring hints are equally valuable, removing easy guesses, etcetera.

Want to know how I made that? I've written articles!
