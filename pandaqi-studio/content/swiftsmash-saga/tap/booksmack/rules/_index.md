Deal everyone 4 cards to take into their hand.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

The game ends when everyone is **out of (hand) cards**. Every card in your _Library_ is worth 1 point. **Highest score wins!**

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

Gameplay happens in _rounds_. There are no turns: everyone plays _at the same time_.

* Everyone picks a secret card from their hand and places it in front of them.
* Once done, everyone reveals their cards at the same time.

The first player to **tap the highest letter (in order of the alphabet)** wins the round!

{{< rules-image src="gameplay.webp" alt="Example of a single round and resolving who wins." >}}

But there are two twists.

* If a letter appears **twice** (uppercase and lowercase), you must tap the **uppercase** version.
* If the cards (when read in order) happen to **spell a word, don't tap any card**. Instead, tap empty space and say the word out loud to win.

The winner of a round wins all the cards. Place them in your _Library_, which is just a facedown pile in front of you on the table.

Some letters look like other letters when viewed differently. Only the REAL letter (seen from the one who played it) counts.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Turn-Based Play" %}}

The default version of _Booksmack_ is a fast and loose (party) game. Try this variant instead if you want to play it more slowly and tactically, not relying on quick thinking or reaction time.

Below are the changes for this variant.

**Setup:** When players aren't used to this variant, it's recommended to start with at least 6 cards per player. Otherwise the game can be over _very_ quickly.

**Objective**: the game ends as soon as a single player is out of cards. 

* Your final score is equal to your Library _plus_ the cards left in your hand.
* All special cards (from expansions) score 1 point, as usual.
* Every letter, however, scores its _position in the alphabet_ divided by 5 (and rounded down).
* If you own both the uppercase and lowercase version of a letter, they are worth +2 points each.
* If you own multiple versions of the same lowercase letter (which is possible with the accents expansion), they are worth -2 points each.

**Gameplay**:

* You play **in turns**. The cards you play are still placed in a circle, not a single pile (as often happens in card games).
* On your turn, you play a card from your hand, and place it in front of you. (Covering your previous card, if it's still there.)
* If it's currently the "highest card" (the one you should "tap"), draw a card from the deck.
* If it's currently the "lowest card", steal a card from another player. (Either blindly from their hand, or the latest card they played in front of them.)
* If you spell a word, you win all cards played: they go into your Library.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Power Punctuation" %}}

This expansion adds **punctuation cards**. Their powers are also written on the cards.

{{< rules-image src="expansion_punctuation.webp" alt="Examples of the powers of all punctuation cards (period, question mark, exclamation mark)." >}}

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Nifty Numbers" %}}

This expansion adds **number cards** (between 1 and 26; not all included).

To win a round, you must still tap the "highest number". But now you'll have to convert letters to numbers, or numbers to letters, to find out which one comes _later_ in the alphabet.

In case of a tie, the _number_ is always higher ranking than the _letter_.

For example, the number "E" is at position 5 of the alphabet. Any number card of 5 or higher would be ranked _higher_ than it.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Giggling Glyphs" %}}

This expansion adds more **uncommon glyphs and symbols**. Their actions are simple and explained on the card. The image below merely clarifies the hardest ones.

{{< rules-image src="expansion_glyphs.webp" alt="Examples of how to use some of the harder special glyph powers." >}}

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Cursed Critics" %}}

This expansion adds **letters with diacritics**, more commonly known as "accents".

> A letter with a diacritic is always considered "higher" than the same letter without it.

If a letter appears multiple times with a diacritic, tapping any of them will win the round. 

This means, on rare occassions, there can be a _tie_ and _multiple winners_. (If people slammed different winning cards at roughly the same time.) In that case, simply distribute the winning cards over the winners as fairly as possible, discarding any leftovers.

When it comes to spelling words, diacritics do not matter. (Example: The word "cafe" is on the table regardless of whether it's "café" or "câfe" or any other variant.)
