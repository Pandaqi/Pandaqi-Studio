## Setup

Turn all cards into a single deck. Shuffle it and place it facedown on the table. Pick any player to be **Headpointer** ( = start player).


## Objective

The game ends as soon as a player has **10 points**. They win!


## Gameplay

{{< rules/rules-example id="turn" >}}

First, the active player **creates piles**.

* They draw twice as many cards as the number of players from the deck. 
* They distribute them into _at most_ as many piles as the number of players.
* Anyone is allowed to look at all the contents of your piles; it's not supposed to be secret.

Then, everyone **picks what they want** (simultaneously).

* Everyone raises their finger (to point at the ceiling)
* The active player counts down (_3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Point!_)
* Everyone taps one of the piles with their fingertip. You may also tap _empty space_ on purpose.

Of course, it's important that players really point at the same time and don't (sneakily or not) change their mind later.

Now resolve **who gets what**.

* If **nobody** wanted a certain pile, **discard** it.
* If only a **single player** wanted a pile, they **score those cards**.
* Otherwise, if **multiple players** point to a pile, **split the pile** and repeat the process.
  * The Headpointer splits the pile into (at least two) smaller piles and counts down.
  * Those players---who wanted the original pile---point at what they want now.
  * Resolve as stated above.
  * If the pile can't be split any further ( = it's 1 card), discard the pile.

If only a **single player** tapped **empty space** this round, they score _all_ cards that would otherwise be discarded. Otherwise they just get nothing.

Cards scored are simply placed **faceup in front of you**, in a row that grows longer and longer. The final card in this row is always your "last card scored"; this is especially important for the expansions.

When all piles are handled, the Headpointer moves to the next player in clockwise direction. Next round!

The base game only contains cards that score points in a simple way. Try the expansions for more chaos AND strategy.

## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

All the expansions are tiny and only add ~10 more cards of a new type. I merely split these cards into many small expansions to make the rulebook cleaner and give you full control over what you print or want to include.

### Variants

For a **harder** game (that requires a better **memory**), keep the scored cards in a single faceup pile. 

* _Other players_ can only ever see the top-most card, which is the last card you scored.
* _You_ are allowed to look back into your score pile and count your points at any time.


### Expansion: Point-a-Police

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_police.webp" alt="Example of what Rule Cards look like and how to use them." >}}

This expansion adds new material: **Rule Cards**. They contain a rule stating which piles someone is allowed to point at in the first place.

Each round, before pointing, 

* Check the _last card scored_ of the Headpointer. 
* If it's a Rule Card, that rule must now be followed by _all players_. 
* (Otherwise, you can ignore them.)

If you point at an invalid pile, according to this rule, you are out of the round. Remove your finger; you get nothing.



### Expansion: Complete-a-Mission

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_mission.webp" alt="Example of what Mission Cards look like and how to use them." >}}

This expansion adds new material: **Mission Cards**.

During setup, everyone draws a secret **Mission**. This card tells you exactly when you win.

The game ends when a player reveals they've won (according to their personal mission).



### Expansion: Dont-a-Touchme

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_touch.webp" alt="Example of what Shy Cards look like and how to use them." >}}

This expansion adds new material: **Shy Cards**. They have a rule about who may (not) tap them.

These rules are only in effect if that card is at the _top_ of its pile ( = it's visible/readable).

There must always be at least **1 pile without a Shy card** on top.



### Expansion: Wait-a-Minute

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_action.webp" alt="Example of what Action Cards look like and how to use them." >}}

This expansion adds new material: **Action Cards**.

* If you have an action card inside your score pile, you may trigger it at any time. 
* Reveal the card and execute its action.
* When done, discard the card.

You may only execute one special action per round.

These cards usually provide a sneaky way to overrule the game's default rules and get what you want.
