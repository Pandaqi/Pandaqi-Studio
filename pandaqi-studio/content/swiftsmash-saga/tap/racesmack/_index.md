The fonts used are **New Amsterdam** (headings) and **Whackadoo** (body text). Yes, that second font was chosen purely because the name ("whack") fits the SwiftSmash saga. I am a professional designer, thank you very much. Everything else is mine.

The idea of the SwiftSmash Saga has always been to have very fast games, with simultaneous turns and quick thinking, almost like a _race to the best card_. It only felt natural to create a game with a _racing_ theme. 

I must admit the theme didn't become as apparent in the final game as I'd hoped, but it was nevertheless a great help for finding this unique ruleset and look.

When I first invented the saga, the idea of "rule cards" (that change the cards you want to tap on the fly) was always something I thought would work well. But I wanted some of the SwiftSmash games to be even _simpler_ and _textless_, so I kept removing the rule from the earlier games (like Smackshapes or Booksmack). 

With this game, I was finally able to center the entire gameplay around these rules cards that not only change every round, but also how every player must "finish" the race.

I think this is a nice "middle of the road game". A bit more depth and strategy than the simpler SwiftSmash games, but faster to pick up and play than some of the harder ones.
