Shuffle all cards into one deck. Deal everyone **4 cards**. Place the remaining cards as a faceup draw pile.

During the game, you'll win cards and place them in a row before you. This is called your **Race**. 

If your Race has a **Finish Card**, and you satisfy its requirements, you win the game. If the deck runs out before this happens, whoever has the _most cards_ in their Race wins.

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

Gameplay happens in **rounds**. There are no turns: everyone plays _at the same time_.

* Everyone picks a secret card from their hand and places it in front of them.
* Once done, everyone reveals their cards at the same time.
* Reveal your cards _facing away from you_. (This means any text on it faces the others, not you.)

Now everyone quickly studies the cards played and then **taps a card**.

{{% remark %}}
Yes, you're allowed to tap a card that another player already tapped.
{{% /remark %}}

Only some cards, however, are "correct". By default,

> A card is **correct** if it contains the **symbol that appears most often** (across all cards). If **none** of the cards are correct, tap your own card.

{{< rules-image src="gameplay_play.webp" alt="Example of how to play a round: play cards, tap the correct one, resolve who gets what." >}}

Once _all players except one_ have tapped something, the round ends.

* If **correct**, you win your own card.
* If **incorrect**, you lose 1 of your Race cards.

Any leftover cards are won by the _first player_ that tapped a _correct card_ (the "fastest winner").

Won cards are placed in your _Race_ (left or right end). When checking if you've finished, only the Finish Card with the _highest number_ in your Race counts.

But there's one final twist.

> When Rule Cards are played, find the one with the **highest** number. Its special rule (top text) determines what cards are "correct", instead of the default rule.

{{% remark %}}
For a very simple first game, you can ignore this mechanic and just always use the "default rule".

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

This game has many different variants that require _no extra material_. This makes it very easy to try a few of them and see if you like the change.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Noise Canceling (Easier)" %}}

The following rule is a different way to handle Rule Cards being played. This makes the game easier, as special rules can often be ignored.

* If exactly **1 Rule Card is played**, then its rule determines the "correct" cards instead.
* Otherwise, if **no or multiple** Rules cards are played, just use the default rules stated above. (They "cancel" each other out.)

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Racing Rules" %}}

This variant simply changes the _default rule_ for each round.

* Keep 9 random Rule Cards in a separate deck.
* At the start of each round, reveal the top one. That's now the "default rule" for finding correct cards.
* Once this deck is empty, simply re-use the same 9 cards again for a new deck.

It also changes what you must do in one specific situation.

> If **only Rule Cards are played**, only the Rule Card with the **highest number** is "correct".

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Time Penalty" %}}

Use this variant if you find players are just tapping randomly and without concern for being incorrect.

When tapping an incorrect card, you must pick one of the following penalties.

* Lose **2 Race cards**.
* Lose **2 Hand cards**.
* Next round, you are **always "incorrect"** if there's a **tie** ( = there are _multiple_ correct cards).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Tiebreaker (Harder)" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="variant_tiebreaker.webp" alt="Example of how to check if you finished your Race (and won the game)." split="leftheavy" %}}

This variant creates only a **single** correct card in most rounds.

* Whenever there are multiple correct cards,
* Ties are broken by the card showing the **color that appears most often** (among the tied cards).
* If still a tie, the **highest number of shapes** on the card wins.

{{% /rules-double-view %}}

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: After You" %}}

This variant makes the game **turn-based** instead of simultaneous.

* Pick any start player.
* Player's hands are "blind": a facedown pile before them.
* From start player, in clockwise turns, people reveal a _single_ card (faceup).
* The smashing begins only **once somebody reveals a Rule Card**.
  * That specific card tells you the rule for what's "correct".
  * If you're correct, you win the entire _pile_ of cards that has built up in front of you.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Shifting Gears" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="expansion_shifting_gears.webp" alt="Example of how to check if you finished your Race (and won the game)." split="leftheavy" %}}

All the cards in the game have three properties: their shapes, their colors, and how many of them.

In the base game, cards show this by simply displaying the icons as many times as needed. 

In this expansion, however, cards will have **different ways of displaying the "how many" part**: number text, fingers on a hand, dice, or tallying.

DEPRECATED:
* COPY = "I am whatever the neighbor is at which I point" => this is just a weird exception now to the otherwise consistent structure. It can also lead to a confusing loop when _all_ cards copy and there is thus no value to any of them. It's messy, it's meh, just left it out.
* INVERT = Show some numbers/symbols but CROSSED OUT. The card is _all the things it didn't cross out_ => this doesn't really work because the core rules of the game stop working if a card can be "multiple things at once".
