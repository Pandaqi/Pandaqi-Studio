I made this game _years_ ago. It's fun, it works, otherwise I wouldn't put it online.

But I've learned a lot since then and aim to make these improvements:
- The game requires you to keep track of _damage_ ... but there's no built-in way to do so.
- Similarly, it requires you to track _how many tiles_ your bullet has crossed. These are always small numbers, and people might prefer their own methods. Still, a simple score token in the game would do wonders.
- The _rules_ are manually translated (from Dutch to English). Some non-essential text (such as remarks in example images) is still in Dutch, which isn't great.

{{% section-centered heading="Frequently Asked Questions" %}}

**Why did you make this game (for free)?** Because I like allowing everyone to play these games, regardless of your income. I also like making innovative games, and this idea of "you're not a color/pawn, you're a side of the board" hasn't been seen before, as far as I can tell.

Nevertheless, if you do enjoy the games I'm creating, please support me by sharing the news, donating, or buying some of my other work.

**How difficult is this game?** The base rules are six pages. This includes examples, images and rather large fonts. The expansions are two or three pages each.

**Will it be updated?** A third expansion is in the works _and_ of course the planned updates I outlined above. If you find errors, or improvements, or have other feedback, I will always listen and improve the game. By all other accounts, this game is finished.
