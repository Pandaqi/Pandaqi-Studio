## Setup

Print a game board and hand out pens. 

Each player picks one inventory at the edge of the board: that's where you'll track your collected Magnetmen.

## Objective

The game ends when nobody can take another move. Sum the values of all Magnetmen you collected: **highest score wins!**


## Gameplay

Take clockwise turns. On your turn, if possible, you must **collect a square**.

* Pick an unused square. (Not destroyed, not collected yet.)
* Cross it out
* Draw the icon in an empty slot in your inventory.

If your inventory is full, you can't take any more turns.

Here's the twist. The more often you possess a specific icon, the more you're _repelled_ by it.

* You have an icon **once**? You can't collect squares horizontally next to it.
* You have an icon **twice**? You can't collect squares horizontally and vertically next to it.
* You have an icon **thrice** (or more)? You can't collect _any_ square next to it (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

That's it!

The paper itself explains how each Magneeple scores you points. Or you can read the section on the [Magnetmen](#magnetmen).

## Advanced Rules

Once you're familiar with the game, and start playing other sets, you can use the advanced rules. This introduces **2 rules changes**.

On your turn, you can also pick the **destroy** action. 

* Pick an unused square.
* Scratch it out entirely. (Make it unrecognizable.)
* This icon is now simply removed from the board.


You don't "get" the icon in your collection. But it can take away good squares from other players, or open up possibilities for yourself. (Because a destroyed icon is removed from the board, it's not considered for the Repel rule.)

Secondly, if you collect any type **4 times**, you take no more turns.

## Magnetmen

Below is an overview of _all_ Magnetmen in the game. 

Please note that there is slight randomization in the generator. Many of the Magnetmen have multiple variations on their power, with one picked at random. Only the most common one is explained below.

The **base** set contains ...

<div data-table="base"></div>

The **advanced** set contains ...

<div data-table="advanced"></div>

The **expert** set contains ...
