## Setup

Sort all cards into facedown piles, one per category. For a first game, just use the base cards, but you can add as many other sets as you want.

Pick any player to start.

## Objective

The game ends once all players have taken a turn. It's cooperative. A higher score is better and the "perfect score" is 10 x the number of turns.


## Gameplay

Start player begins, then take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, draw 5 random cards from different categories. Then use the **Rank Tokens** to rank them from left to right. Left means "this makes me most unhappy" and right means "this makes me most happy". Place the tokens facedown, where the color/icon matches the card of that category.

You can also view it as "don't like it <-> do like it", or a similar scale of preference.

Once you're done, all the other players try to _guess_ your ranking. They also place Rank Tokens on the other side of the cards.

Once done, **reveal and compare!** Each token in the right place gives you +1 point. Guessing them _all_ correctly _doubles_ your points for this round.

## Upgrades

**Can't I just use the cards themselves for the second ranking?** Yes, the second ranking (by the group) can reorder the original cards! Do that, if you prefer it. Playtesting, however, showed that some people find this confusing and would rather match a row of tokens to an identical row of tokens. That's why all tokens are included twice.

**Want a harder or easier game?** 
* Change how many cards you draw on your turn. (More cards = harder)
* Or allow the active player to play _one_ token faceup. (Easier, because you're helping the others by giving away one correct answer.)

**Want more randomness to cards?** Just put all cards into one deck and shuffle. On your turn, you simply draw 5 cards from the top. Also use the **Rank Tokens** with numbers (not categories) to indicate your ranking, where 1 is "most unhappy" and 5 is "most happy".

The tokens with categories obviously cannot work when there can be multiple cards with the same category in one round!
