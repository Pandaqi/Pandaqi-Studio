**Don't want to print stuff?** You can also play the game digitally on a single smartphone. Go to [the game](game) on a device and check "Load Digital Game".

**Which pack(s) should I use!?** The base, advanced, expert and silly packs contain ~10 new cards for each category. They are the largest and most diverse. They get slightly more _complex_ (in order of the list), but you should mostly see this as a way to break the game into more manageable files to print and cut.

The other packs add cards within one particular category, such as _Superpowers_: cards proposing a fun dilemma through a superpower with a drawback. They are usually much smaller and should just be shuffled into the category cards you already have.

## Background

This game is a personal project. I've been struggling with finding something I enjoy and gives me happiness for as long as I can remember. This game is basically another experiment in trying to find answers or discoveries. It's also why the game is kept really small and simple, with no marketing, expansions, or any of the stuff I usually do.

It's a simple, fun structure that allows a group of people to think about what makes them and others (un)happy. A game that isn't really a game, but it kinda is. It's as serious or as silly as your group wants it to be.

**Want to add your own cards?** You can always send me a message with ideas for cards! Once I have enough, I can easily add them as another pack.
