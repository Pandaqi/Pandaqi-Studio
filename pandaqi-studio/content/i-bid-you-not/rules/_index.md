## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" alt="The different parts of a tile and what they mean." >}}

Shuffle the deck. Place the top card open on the table: this represents the current **offer**.

Deal the remaining cards until the deck is empty.

By making the deck bigger/smaller you can control game length. If you remove cards, it's recommended to remove the _extreme numbers_ (highest/lowest).

## Objective

The game ends as soon as **all players are out of cards**. Count the total price value of your score pile. The **highest score wins**!


## Gameplay

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, either **add a card** or **declare an auction.**

### Add A Card

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="add_a_card.webp" alt="Example of the simple action of adding a card to the offer." >}}

Add a card from your hand to the **offer**. Place it next to the final offer card, building a row from left to right.

You may only add cards with a _higher number_ than the previous offer card.

If you can't or don't want to add a card, you must declare an auction instead.



### Declare An Auction

All players secretly pick a card from their hand: their **bid**. Reveal simultaneously.

Now sort the the players from _highest bid_ to _lowest bid_. If all bids are inside the number range of the offers, the auction **inverts**: sort players from _lowest bid_ to _highest bid_.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
In other words, it inverts if **no bid** is higher than the highest offer card or lower than the lowest offer card.

Ask these questions until somebody decides to take the offer.

* Do you want this offer? Then take it. Add the cards to your score pile.
* You don't want it? Pay for the privilege to skip. **Discard** a random card from your score pile. Then **add** one card from your hand to the offer, anywhere you want.

If it comes to the last player---the one with the worst bid---they _must_ accept. If you can't pay to skip, you must also accept.

The lowest bid starts the **next offer**. All other bids are discarded.

## Upgrades

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! These expansions simply add _more cards_ with unique numbers and actions. (The game should never have two cards with the same number.)

### Variants

Try any of these variants to spice up the game.

* The winner of an auction _chooses_ which of the bids starts the **next offer**.
* The middle bid is not discarded; it _returns_ to the player's hand. (With an even number of players, this means the middle two bids.) This only happens, though, if they didn't skip or win the auction.
* To **skip** winning an auction, _either_ add one card to the offer _or_ discard a random scored tile.
* If you skip, the card you add to the offer must be in **numerical order**. (Either lower than the lowest if you place it to the left, or higher than the highest if you place it to the right.)
* When counting your **score**, only the _highest_ and _lowest_ price per type count. (_Example: you have -3, -1, 3 and 5 for the Swatphone. Then only the -3 and 5 score._)


### Odd Inventions

This expansion adds _negative numbers_. This changes nothing in the rules, but simply gives a larger range of values that can be played or bid.

It also adds more actions, most of which are more chaotic and wild than the base actions.


### Double Devices

This expansion adds _higher numbers_, up to at most 100. This, again, changes nothing about the rules and just increases the variety of values.

It also adds more actions that allow playing with core aspects of the game.
