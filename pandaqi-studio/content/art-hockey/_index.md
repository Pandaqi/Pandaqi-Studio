<span class="art-hockey-red">Your objective?</span> Shoot the ball against your opponent's goal.

<span class="art-hockey-blue">How?</span> By drawing lines to deflect the ball.

<span class="art-hockey-green">Problems?</span> You only have limited ink, and can only draw one line at a time.

<span class="art-hockey-purple">The catch?</span> The previous line you've drawn ... becomes your next goal!

{{% section-centered heading="WHY FREE?" %}}

I strive to create innovative multiplayer games, for all ages, to bring people _together_ in real life.

But I know there's a great risk to buying multiplayer games: how often do you even have time to play a game with your friends or family? How can you be sure?

As such, I provide these games for free, no matter how good I think they are.

Within the game, you can (only if you want to) watch an advertisment to receive extra content, such as powerups. Doing so would already be a great way to support me!
