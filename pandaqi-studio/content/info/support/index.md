**All support is welcome!** I focus on making as many good games as I can and giving them to everyone for free, even including code. This obviously does not generate income.

It doesn't cost you anything to **give feedback** on my games or directly to me. Even if you hated a game I made, it's more valuable to _let me know_ than to stay silent!

It's also free to **share the word**. My games are literally made to print (or buy/download) once then _share_ with your friends, family, colleagues, whatever.

The most fun way to support me is by **buying my work**!

Or you can **give me a project** to do as [a registered freelance artist in the Netherlands](https://rodepanda.com).

Visit the [TiamoPastoor.com support page](https://tiamopastoor.com/info/support/) for the latest, most complete rundown of support options.
