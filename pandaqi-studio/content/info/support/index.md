Being a solo game developer who focuses on a typical "unprofitable" genre (local multiplayer, family-friendly games) ... all support is more than welcome.

It doesn't cost you anything to **give feedback** on my games or directly to me

Even if you hated a game I made, it's more valuable to _let me know_ than to stay silent!

It's also free to **share the word**. My games are literally made to buy once then _share_ with your friends, family, colleagues, whatever.

Of course, a fun way to support me is by **buying my work**! Most of it is free with the _option_ to pay. So it's up to you to decide how much you pay.

Or you can **give me a project** to do as a freelancer. Visit [my portfolio](https://rodepanda.com) to get an idea of my full body of work.
