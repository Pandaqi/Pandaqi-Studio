Starting midway 2023, I decided to "officially" build my fanbase on <strong><a href="https://patreon.com/tiamopastoor">Patreon</a></strong>.

After trying many systems and setups, this was the easiest to find for others and use by me. Your support, be it financial or through feedback, is very welcome.

(Additionally, every email newsletter provider I tried to use shut down a year later ... hmm ... )

I still try to push out updates and notifications anywhere else that you might find me. But it might be less regular and less polished---I can only be at so many places at once, and Patreon is the place to be.
