{{< custom-entry-banner id="0" title="Mail me!" bg="mail_bg" thumb="mail_logo" class="blue" >}}

My mailbox is always open for you: [askthepanda@pandaqi.com](mailto:askthepanda@pandaqi.com)

Feedback, feature requests, questions about how/why I made something, proposals for collaborations, you name it. Well, anything except _spam_ of course.

Alternatively, mail me at: [tiamo@rodepanda.com](mailto:tiamo@rodepanda.com). That's the officially registered name for my business (in the Netherlands).

Because I create (local) multiplayer games, getting feedback and working together with my players is even more important. They _literally_ can't exist without a group of enthusiastic players.
- Want to help me test my next game? Contact me!
- Found a serious issue with a game (bug, crash, annoying mechanic)? Contact me!
- Have your own ideas, proposals, feature requests? Contact me!

{{< custom-entry-banner id="2" title="itch.io" bg="itch_bg" thumb="itch_logo" class="green" >}}

itch.io is the online game marketplace where all my projects can be downloaded and/or purchased!

I also regularly give feedback to others, update my games there, and participate in game jams.

{{< custom-entry-banner id="3" title="YouTube" bg="yt_bg" thumb="yt_logo" class="red" >}}

Whenever a new game is published, trailers (and related material) will appear on my YouTube channel. I might also create devlogs, depending on the project.

I am a (general) freelance artist in the Netherlands: [Rode Panda - Portfolio](https://rodepanda.com)

I also write books, create music, design picturebooks and websites, and some more creative stuff.

The name "Pandaqi" comes from a tutorial website I started long ago. It has moved to a new address (a sub domain): [Pandaqi Tutorials](https://pandaqi.com/tutorials)

Similarly, I blog about what I do at [Pandaqi Blog](https://pandaqi.com/blog).

You might also find me on other platforms (Twitter, GameJolt, Discord, etc.) These accounts are rarely checked or updated. I believe in having a strong core platform (my own website + itch.io) and a single communication channel (email), instead of creating and managing accounts all over the place, without really using those websites myself.
