{{< custom-entry-banner id="0" title="Mail me!" bg="mail_bg" thumb="mail_logo" class="blue" >}}

Send me feedback, feature requests, questions about how I made something, proposals for collaborations, you name it. Well, anything except _spam_ of course.

My email address is: [schoolofpanda@gmail.com](mailto:schoolofpanda@gmail.com)

Because I create (local) multiplayer games, getting feedback and working together with my players is even more important. They _literally_ can't exist without a group of enthusiastic players.
- Want to help me test my next game? Contact me!
- Found a serious issue with a game (bug, crash, annoying mechanic)? Contact me!
- Have your own ideas, proposals, feature requests? Contact me!

{{< custom-entry-banner id="2" title="itch.io" bg="itch_bg" thumb="itch_logo" class="green" >}}

This is the trusted online marketplace where all my **video game** projects can be downloaded and/or purchased!

I also regularly give feedback to others, update my games there, and participate in game jams.

Whenever I make a new **video game** that's professional enough, I will make trailers and perhaps devlogs for it. They appear on my YouTube channel.

{{< custom-entry-banner id="4" title="Other" class="black height-large" >}}

I maintain a blog with **devlogs** about literally all my game projects and updates at [Pandaqi Blog](https://pandaqi.com/blog).

The name "Pandaqi" comes from a **tutorial website** I started long ago. It has moved to a new address (a sub domain): [Pandaqi Tutorials](https://pandaqi.com/tutorials)

I'm a registered **freelance artist** in the Netherlands: [Portfolio](https://rodepanda.com). I also write books, create music, design picturebooks and websites, and some more creative stuff.

To know how to **support** me, visit the [Support Page](/info/support/).

That's all. You might find my name elsewhere, but know the account is not used or maybe not even me.
