Everyone receives a unique **clue** in the form of a drawing. For example: "The treasure is next to a palm tree".

When you know _all_ the clues, they point to exactly _one_ tile on the map: the treasure!

But you can't just share your clues: you can only ask the players questions in mysterious ways ...

This game is a spin-off of [Pirate Riddlebeard](https://pandaqi.com/pirate-riddlebeard). It was designed to be **language independent** (all clues are visual) and use **simpler maps and clues**. A more kid/family friendly version of the same idea!

## What do I need?

Three steps.
* Read the rules. (Click the "Download" button.)
* Grab some pens and papers.
* Start the [game](game) on your phone and play!

**Reusable version?** You can also download a material sheet _once_ and reuse that for all your games!

**Phone?** You only need a device (and internet) to generate the setup. Once that's done, you can put it away.

**Offline version?** There's a folder called "Generated Games". Pick one, print it, cut the hints into cards, and you can play completely offline at some later point in time.

## Background

How does this game work? A smart algorithm! It creates a random map and tries to find a set of hints that lead to exactly _one_ tile. I created the original algorithm for [Pirate Riddlebeard](https://pandaqi.com/pirate-riddlebeard). Then I refined it and switched to _images_ (instead of text hints) for this game.

The fonts are **Chelsea Market** for headings and **Charis Sil** for the rest. Both are freely available on Google Fonts.

Everything else is mine. The generated boards/game used _Phaser 3_ before, but have since been translated to use my own custom frameworks that make this website possible.
