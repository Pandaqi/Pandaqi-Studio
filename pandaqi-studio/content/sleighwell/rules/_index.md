## Setup

Place the sleigh tile in the center of the table. Deal everybody 4 tiles to take into their hand. Shuffle the remaining tiles and place them facedown within everyone's reach; this is the draw pile.

## Objective

In this game you deliver presents to houses. The game ends when ...

* You've managed to score _all houses_ (in the deck)!
* Or it's impossible to do so (most likely because everyone is out of tiles).

Sum the stars on the houses you scored: that's your final score.

If you scored **all houses**, you've beat the game and have proven yourself worthy Santa Clauses!


## Gameplay

Take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, take one action: **PLAY** or **SLEIGH**.

The rules below always hold.
* You're **never** allowed to split the board. Everything must stay connected at all times.
* Discuss and strategize, sure, but **never** show or communicate your exact cards. 
* A question mark is a **wildcard**. It represents any value you want.

After your turn, always draw back up to 4 tiles. If you **can't do anything** (which is quite rare), just draw 1 tile and your turn is over.

### Play

Play a tile from your hand. It must be next to an existing tile.

> Numbers in rows/columns must always be either ascending or descending.

If this already **isn't true** for a sequence (which the expansions can cause), you can't add a tile to that sequence.

### Sleigh

Move the **sleigh** in a straight line to somewhere else. (That is, the destination is on the same row or column.)

You can place it _on a tile_ or in _an empty space_ (adjacent to a tile).

All tiles you pass along the way, including the one on which you landed, are **removed**.

If you ended on a **house**, and the tiles you removed satisfy the **wishes of that house** (at least), you score it! Place the house on your score pile.

That's it! Have fun.

## Upgrades

Try any of the variants to make the base game fit better with your specific player group. And once you have a few games under your belt, add an expansion to spice it up! 

### Variants

**Want a shorter/easier game?** Pick one or multiple of the changes below.

* Include fewer houses. For each house left out, though, also remove a random other tile from the deck.
* Start with the lowest value building (just wants 1 present of any type) next to the sleigh. This immediately gives you something to aim for and something to score.
* (Optional) Use _two_ sleighs.

**Want a harder game?** Don't allow the sleigh to land on empty spots (outside of the board). It can only land on existing tiles (removing those too, as usual).

**Want to play solo?**

* You get 7 tiles in your hand.
* After each turn, draw 2 tiles from the deck. For each, decide whether to play or discard it.
* (@TODO:Insert special "solo" tiles showing a sleigh/reindeer? When they appear, you _must_ take that action next turn.)


### Reindeer way

This expansion adds Reindeer tiles.

This allows a **third possible action** to do on your turn: **Reindeer Way**. 

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
You can remember this because it rhymes: Play, Sleigh, Reindeer Way!
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

Discard a tile from your hand (to pay for this action).

Then,
* Pick an existing tile next to a **group of reindeer**. (At least two connected reindeer tiles.) 
* Move this tile to a _new_ destination adjacent to this group.
* If this destination already contains a tile, swap them. 

When moving a tile this way, you **don't have to follow** the placement rules from the PLAY action (ascending / descending number)!

{{< rules/rules-image src="action_reindeer.webp" alt="Example of Reindeer Way action and what is or isn't allowed." >}}

It also adds **double presents**: cards that show _two_ types. When delivering, you pick the one type it represents. (It's not both types at once.)

Finally, it adds new houses (that wish for a reindeer, somehow).


### Tough Trees

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_tough_trees.webp" alt="Example of using a Christmas Tree tile." >}}

This expansion adds the **Christmas Tree** tile.
* It is **not removed** when doing the sleigh action. (Unless it's part of a house's wishes.)
* It can **not** move using reindeers.
* When placed, you draw **2 tiles** at the end of your turn (instead of 1). This _permanently_ raises your hand limit by 1. These tiles may be taken either from the table or the deck. 


It adds tiles with **double numbers**. For such a tile, pretend it has both those numbers (and all in-between). Yes, this makes placement much harder.

It also adds optional tiles with **special actions** written on them. (You can leave them out if you want a textless game.) The action is executed immediately after placing the tile.

Finally, it adds new houses (that wish for a tree).
