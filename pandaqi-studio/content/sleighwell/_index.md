## Background

Obviously, this game started a few months before Christmas. I'd already created a Halloween game which we played with the family that same night. It was quite a success, so my mind raced to invent another simple game (for a large group of players) for Christmas.

After a week of half-baked not-so-great ideas, this one came along. I instantly tested it against myself (with a paper prototype) and confirmed it had potential. A few days later, Sleighwell existed.

A simple game that simulates Santa's job quite well, while being _cooperative_ (always great for families or large groups) and having surprising _depth_. The teach is one minute. Turns are five seconds. Ideal for a family game!
