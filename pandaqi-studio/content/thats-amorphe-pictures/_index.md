You receive a drawing of a cat. You have to change it into a farmer with just three lines. Others need to guess what on earth you did. A spin-off of [That's Amorphe](/thats-amorphe).

## What's the idea?

Each round, you're teamed up (randomly) in pairs. You draw a word from your card, then give it to your teammate.

They must _change_ your drawing to a different word (from their card). But only by _some secret amount_! 

How do you change a dog into a house _by a little bit_? How do you turn a fireman into a teddy bear _by a lot_?

You score points only if the other players guess your secret number!

## What do I need?

Three simple steps.

* Click the "Download" button to find the Rules and Material.
* Pick any **one** PDF with "word cards" (4 pages)---print it.
* Read the rules (2 pages) and have fun!

**Competitive?** The game can be played cooperatively _and_ competitively. For the second mode, however, you need one extra page of material (see "vote tokens").

**Want more?** This website can generate [new word cards](game) for you!

## Timer

It's highly recommended to put a (strict) timer on the drawing rounds. Players might say they don't want that: they are wrong 😉 It makes the game quicker, more fun, and prevents any "cheats" players will come up with (like making very detailed drawings).

You can use anything! Or use my simple [timer](/tools/use/timer/) page.

## Background

This game is a spin-off of [That's Amorphe](https://pandaqi.com/thats-amorphe). Visit that page for more information! 

The two games are very similar. In fact, you can reuse material if you want. But this version is slightly simpler, more immediate, and more accessible. (Most people can draw _somewhat_, while they might struggle to find words.) You might view it as a "sequel".
