## Credits

The fonts used are **4th of July** (headings, fancy text) and **Neuton** (body text, readable, multiple variations). Both freely available online. Parts of the illustrations were generated with AI; everything else is mine.

As usual with me, this game idea popped into my head just a few weeks before New Year's Eve. I raced to develop and finish it, then tested it that night with family, and it just ... worked really well? I barely had to polish and tweak afterwards.

I guess that's the benefit of basing a game idea on two proven mechanics: **push your luck** and **deck building**. The first mechanic is about asking players if they want to continue playing (e.g. "reveal another card") at the risk of drawing something bad and being eliminated. The second asks players to use their rewards of a round (e.g. "each card is worth 1 coin") to buy new cards and therefore build a better deck over time. 

One of my simplest games, one of my most thematic games, and one that seems to hook most people immediately.
