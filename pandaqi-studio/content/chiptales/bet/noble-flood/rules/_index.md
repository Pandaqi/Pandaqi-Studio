## Setup

Create a deck of **Cards** and a deck of **Contracts**. Assign anyone to be the Dealer.

You _can_ print only the contracts and use a standard deck of cards. Only use the numbers 1 to 10, not the face cards. For the purposes of this game, the Ace is considered the lowest card (a "1").


## Objective

The game ends when the **deck of contracts is empty**. (There are too few contracts left to setup the round.)

Players sum the scores on all their contracts. A faceup contract scores its _plus points_; a facedown contract score its _minus points_. **Highest score wins!**


## Gameplay

Play happens in rounds. Each round has three simple phases: DEAL, PLAY and SCORE. 

{{< rules/rules-example id="turn" >}}

### Deal

The Dealer ...
* Creates a row with faceup contracts, with twice as many cards as the number of players. (Draw new ones from the deck to fill gaps left by the previous round.)
* Places 3 facedown cards from the deck in a row
* Hands all players 3 cards.

The Dealer calls out one **suit** OR **number** as the **wildcard** for this round.

Now take clockwise turns from the Dealer picking contracts. Continue until all players have passed.
* The Dealer **must** pick at least one contract.
* Everyone else **may** pick one on their turn.
* When you're satisfied with your contract(s), say "pass" and you get no more turns this phase.

### Play

Keep taking clockwise turns from the Dealer until everyone is out of hand cards.

On the Dealer's turn only, they start by flipping a **facedown card faceup**.

Then, on your turn, you **must play a hand card**. 

> Either its **suit** or its **number** must match all adjacent cards.

There are a few exceptions to this.

* If a suit or number matches the **wildcard** (called out by the leader), it can be anything you want.
* The maximum map size is 5 by 5 cards.
* If you can't legally play a card, reveal a card from your hand and discard it.

### Score

All players check if their contracts have been met.
* If so, place the contract faceup before you.
* If not, place it facedown before you.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
The "wildcard" from the Dealer only **applies to placement, not scoring.**
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

Finally, a few clarifications on terminology in the contracts:

* A "row" is any row (horizontal line of cards) or column (vertical line of cards) in the map.
* "Adjacent" means the cards are horizontally or vertically next to each other. (You can create a "path" through the map, jumping from card to card, that passes this set of cards precisely.)
* "Numerical order" means each card is exactly one number higher than the previous.

The Dealer moves one player clockwise. Next round!

## Upgrades

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! Try any of the expansions below.

### Variant: 2 Players

With 2 players, it's recommended to increase the number of cards per round.

* The map starts with 5 facedown cards.
* As expected, you also get 5 cards in your hand.
* At the start of the round, you draw **three times** as many contracts as the number of players.


### Variant: Switchy Suits

This is a variant that requires no extra material.

On your turn, you're also allowed to **switch contracts**.
* Swap a contract for one still in the market. If none exists, swap with the contract of another player.
* Pay for this by revealing your entire hand to everyone.
* You can only swap for a contract with a _lower_ reward (than the one you're giving away).
* If you didn't start with a contract, you can't do this.


### Full Flood

This expansion adds **action cards** ( = extra material to print and cut).

These trigger a certain ability or rule, usually when played. They explain themselves.


### Straight (Hand)Shake

This expansion adds more **(special) contracts** ( = extra material to print and cut).

These contracts add a few more options and variations. Most importantly, some also add rules or powers _while you have the contract_. They explain themselves.
