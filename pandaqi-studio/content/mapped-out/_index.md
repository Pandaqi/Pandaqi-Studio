## Background

This idea was hard to "finalize". It started with a very simple one-liner idea: "Let's turn the typical board game with a map _on its head!_"

Instead of having a pawn on a map and trying to walk the optimal route ... you start with a fixed route (set of directions on cards) and must design the _map_ to get the most out of your route.

Very unique, very promising, but ... how do you make this into a game? How do you give players a fixed route they can't change (too much), without making players just feel powerless or their route unfair? And how do you reward players for "walking a good route through the map", without having very complicated scoring rules?

After several iterations, I figured out the simplest system possible to accomplish all this. As usual, the solution was to kill several birds with one stone: when you _add_ a tile to the map on your turn, that same tile also shows an _action_ to get to know more about your route. Players need to constantly balance building a map that gives them loads of points, with actions that will actually reveal their secret route they're supposed to walk at the end.

It took a few tries, but finally the ideas came together and we get this nice little game as a result!

Also, a lot of my original ideas were decisively moved to _expansions_, to really keep the base game small, textless, and kid friendly. If you think the base game is a bit too simplistic or straightforward, be sure to try out the expansions.
