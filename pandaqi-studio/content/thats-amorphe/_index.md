What happens when you morph a cat halfway into a house? And what if you do it _a little bit_? A party game about inventing things and then asking others to guess what on earth you meant.

## What's the idea?

Draw two **word cards**. Place them open on the table: these are the start and end of your _scale_.

Then you draw a **secret** morph card. It tells you how much the _first word_ morphs into the _second word_.

It's up to you to _invent_ something that fits the description! 

What's halfway a bike and a house? What's 80% between a cow and a car? What's _mostly_ like a laptop, but also a _little bit_ like a banana?

The other players must answer these questions. You score points only if they guess (close to) the correct morph number!

## What do I need?

Four simple steps.

* Click the "Download" button to find the Rules and Material.
* Pick any **one** PDF with "word cards" (4 pages)---print it.
* Download the PDF with "morph cards" (1 page)---print it.
* Read the rules (2 pages) and have fun!

**Want more?** This website can generate [random word cards](game) for you! You know, if you've played the game fifty times and want some variation.

## Taking too long?

Coming up with a great morph is _hard_. People might take too long on their turn, while they keep thinking and can't make a decision.

To solve that, use my [timer](/tools/use/timer/). A length of 1-2 minutes (at most!) should be great.

The inspiration for this game came from popular party games such as Wavelength.
