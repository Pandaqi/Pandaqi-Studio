Having discussions about whether something is a word? Use my [dictionary](/tools/dictionary) as your judge.

It only contains more common or popular words. Using it will solve this issue for groups endlessly debating what is a valid word!

Check out the main project page at [Keebble Games](/keebble-games/) for the credits and more information.

This version is a "traditional" board game. Grab your material (lots of dominoes) once and play with it forever. No blank papers or devices needed during play.

Of course, the interesting letters (that look like different letters from different angles) and domino rules make this game anything but regular!

For a detailed diary about the game, check out the [devlog](/blog/boardgames/keebble-domino).
