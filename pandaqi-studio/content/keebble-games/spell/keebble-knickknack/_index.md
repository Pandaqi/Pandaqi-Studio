## What do I need?

Three steps.
* Read the [playful rules](rules). 
* Grab some pens and a blank piece of paper.
* Open the [game interface](game) on any device.

You can start completely blank. Or you can use the [board generator](board) to get a nice random _starting setup_!

## That's Not A word!

Having discussions about whether something is a word? Use my [dictionary](/tools/use/dictionary) as your judge.

It only contains more common or popular words. Using it will solve this issue for groups endlessly debating what is a valid word!

## Background

This version simplifies many things, at the cost of requiring one device while playing. Why? Because now the device does the heavy lifting for you. It tracks score, it tracks letters, it tracks when the game ends, etcetera.

For a detailed diary about the game, check out the [devlog](/blog/boardgames/keebble-knickknack).
