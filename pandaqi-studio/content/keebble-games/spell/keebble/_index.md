## What do I need?

Three steps.
* Read the [playful rules](rules). 
* Grab some pens or pencils.
* Grab a blank piece of paper and fold it in half six times. (Or any other number, depending on how long you want the game to last.)

You can start completely blank. Or you can use the generator to get a nice random _starting setup_!

## That's Not A Word!

Having discussions about whether something is a word? Use my [dictionary](/tools/dictionary) as your judge.

It only contains more common or popular words. Using it will solve this issue for groups endlessly debating what is a valid word!

## Background

This was the very first Keebble game. The original, if you want. In fact, this only turned into a _project_ (with multiple games) later.

This is no replacement for Scrabble, of course not. But it's close in theme and feel, while only requiring a single empty paper (or a printed one with random setup, if you want) and playing much faster. Travel Scrabble, perhaps. 

Trying to develop such a unique experience taught me a lot about game design _and_ gave me the ideas for the other versions, which have deeper gameplay and are more "traditional" games.
