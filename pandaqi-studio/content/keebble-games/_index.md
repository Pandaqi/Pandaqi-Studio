The font used is **Arbetus Slab** for both heading and body. Everything else---images, code, idea, rules, etcetera---was made by me.

This project was obviously inspired by Scrabble. Most people know and enjoy the game. But I saw some things to improve: it can take too long, you need to carry a big box, there's no variation to the board. 

I sought to improve those things!

The first result was "Keebble": free to play, highly portable, with simultaneous turns and more variation. Once I'd made that, I realized I could also make a hybrid version (use a single smartphone to manage the game and add cool extra possibilities) and then had a crazy idea about a domino version with an ambigram font.

In the end, this turned one Scrabble-inspired game into an entire project of simple language games :)
