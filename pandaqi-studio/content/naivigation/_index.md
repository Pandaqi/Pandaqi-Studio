Everyone steers the same car. Will you make it to the finish?

A cooperative game for 2&ndash;10 players about guessing the actions of your fellow players, creating a solid plan without saying anything ... and then failing to execute that plan and driving your car into a lake.

<h2 class="purpleCategory">What do I need?</h2>

{{% section-centered heading="" %}}

This game is "print 'n play", which means you can play it for free by taking these simple steps:
1. Click the "Download" button to go to my Google Drive folder.
2. Once there, download the Rules and Files in your preferred language.
3. Print the files (6 pages in total) and cut out any cards/tiles.
4. Read/print the rules (6 pages&mdash;including images, examples, and clarifications)
5. Find some friends and start playing!

Each game I create has been thoroughly playtested and designed as professionally as possible. Nevertheless, if you find errors, unclear rules, or have ideas for improvements, never hesitate to let me know: [schoolofpanda@gmail.com](mailto:schoolofpanda@gmail.com)

<h2 class="blueCategory">How does it work?</h2>

{{% section-centered heading="" %}}

Reach the finish line _before_ destroying the car. 

Players, however, steer the car simultaneously. Without communicating, players play cards from their hands face-down, until they've created a row of instructions ("forward", "turn left", ...).

Magic happens! Reveal all the instructions and execute them, moving the car over the road. Which might be exactly what you hoped for ... or might go terribly wrong.

<h2 class="redCategory">Expansions &amp; Updates</h2>

{{% section-centered heading="" %}}

This game has been enjoyed immensely by my groups. 

It also has the greatest potential. The base game is about steering a car, but what if you were steering a train instead? Or flying airplanes? Or sitting on a boat?

But it's not perfect. There are tweaks to the system that will make it shine even more, and I'm working on that.

The grand plan is to make a separate and unique game for each vehicle, but also a way to play _all of them_ simultaneously. These are the planned expansions:
- Singing Sails
- Troublesome Trains
- Frightening Flights
- Naivigation: Around the World
- (Base game: some minor expansions)
