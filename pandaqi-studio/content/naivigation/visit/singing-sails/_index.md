## What do I need?

This game is part of the Naivigation universe. It means you need two things to play this game.

* The Core Set from [Naivigation](/naivigation/) (which you need for all games).
* And the specific material for _this_ game. ("Download" > Core Set.)

Print and cut it, read the short [playful rules](rules), and you can play!

**Playful Rules?** It means you can press a button to get random examples of turns and setup, which is far more useful (and fun) than reading some text! I've been creating such rules for years now to great success.

**Want more?** You can also [generate your own material](#material) right on this website, to suit your specific needs.

## Credits

This project started as the "middle game" of the 5 major Naivigation games. It's slightly more involved than the starter games, because of how wind direction and strength must move your ship. But it's still very simple, because a ship is quite free to move in the water, and everyone intuitively knows it can't move over land.

To make the game shine (and more intuitive/realistic), though, I had to add one or two extra rules. Such as that a Ship can only visit harbors if rotated the right way. Otherwise, it looks weird (it would destroy the whole harbor! so dangerous!), and the game is less challenging. Once all this work was said and done, I decided it was probably best to place this as a slightly more advanced Naivigation game.

But in return for a few more rules, you get a more fluid and creative game, where the ocean map is built as you go. The expansions are certainly recommended too, adding fun elements like pirate ships, treasures and water currents.
