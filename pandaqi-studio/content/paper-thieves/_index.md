## What's this about?

All players play the head of a thieving crew, obsessed with stealing treasures and then fleeing the city.

Coincidentally, they also win the game if they do that.

On your turn, take one of these actions:
* **Move yourself:** if you end on a treasure spot, you grab it. But you can't go past police or other players.</li>
* **Move police:** move the police through the city.

Each treasure gives you special powers. But the police might also have some special powers ...

A game about stealing the most useful treasures before anyone else, setting yourself up for a quick exit, and making sure your fellow players don't completely block all your passages.
