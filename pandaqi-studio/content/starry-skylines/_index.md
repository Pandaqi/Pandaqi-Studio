A [One Paper Game](/boardgames#one-paper-games) for 1--9 players about simultaneously building a city in space.

Build the nicest neighbourhood on your planet and **score the most points**. The problem? Your opponents are doing the same and invading your precious space!

Each round, this website presents **three new options**. Each player must **pick one** of the options and execute it.

An option can contain _buildings_ to place, _people_ to add to your buildings, a _special effect_ to execute or a _street number_ to place.

Play continues until the board is full or a player has been unable to do a move for several turns.

Count your people, count your buildings, get awards for special achievements, and voila---the player with the most points wins!

**Only 3 players maximum?** Nope! As stated in the rules, each _paper_ has a maximum of 3 players. So, for example, with 5 players you play on _two_ papers. Copy this same starting setup to all.

## What do I need?

Three simple steps.

* Grab an empty sheet of paper, fold it six times.
* Click "Download" to find the rulebook. (Only read the first few pages for your first game.)
* Open the [game](game) on any device.

This website handles everything for you. It also shows explanations for all the different buildings and mechanics (if you **click** on them).

**Don't like blank papers?** Use the [board](board) generator to get a random starting setup.

## Background

I've also written a detailed devlopment log about the whole process of creating this game: [(Devlog) Starry Skylines](/blog/boardgames/starry-skylines/devlog-starry-skylines)

About the screenshots of real games: yeah, we couldn't find any white paper, therefore we used yellow ones. This is a section of the campaign I played with two players; there are more games on the backside of these papers.

## Credits

This game is inspired by the boardgame [Welcome To ...](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233867/welcome). If you like this game, check out that one!

Because the first font looked "space-y", while legible. The second font looked like the letters were skylines. Perfect!
