{{< custom-entry-banner id="0" title="What's this?" class="green" >}}

This page contains some general tools I built for my (board) games. These are simple things that are really _useful_ to have for most games. (But also very _optional_.)

If you think something's missing, let me know! I'm very good at forgetting to update these overview pages whenever I make new systems.

{{< custom-entry-banner id="1" title="Timer" class="orange" url="timer" >}}

A simple timer to use with party games. Or when your play group tends to think too long on their turns :p

<button class="btn">Go to timer</button>

{{< custom-entry-banner id="2" title="Dictionary" class="blue" url="dictionary" >}}

A dictionary to help you decide if something is a word or not. Developed for usage with my "word games".

{{< custom-entry-banner id="3" title="Randomness" class="purple" url="randomness" >}}

Some simple buttons for _randomness_ in your games: flip a coin, throw some dice, or anything else.
