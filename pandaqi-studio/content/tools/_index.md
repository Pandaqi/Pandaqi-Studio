## What's this?

This page contains some general tools I built for my (board) games. These are simple things that are really _useful_ to have for most games. (But also very _optional_.)

If you think something's missing, let me know! I'm very good at forgetting to update these overview pages whenever I make new systems.

* [Timer](use/timer/) => A simple timer to use with party games. Or when your play group tends to think too long on their turns :p
* [Dictionary](use/dictionary/) => A dictionary to help you decide if something is a word or not. Developed for usage with my "word games".
* [Random](use/randomness) => Some simple buttons for _randomness_ in your games: flip a coin, throw some dice, or anything else.
* [Categorizer](use/categorizer) => Comprehensive lists of game genres, categories, themes and mechanics. Also a tool to randomly get inspired.
