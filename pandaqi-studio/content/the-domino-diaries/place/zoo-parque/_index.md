## Credits

The fonts used are **Ceviche One** (headings) and **Noticia Text** (body text). Some generative image AI was used. Everything else (code, idea, rules, illustrations) is entirely mine.

When I invented the Theme Park-related game in this collection, my mind immediately added the Zoo-related one as well. Those two are just inextricably linked in my head, after growing up on games like Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon. After a few days of passively brainstorming, while I work on other things, I figured out some unique approaches to really make this one feel _different_ and more like a real zoo.

It ended up being one of the hardest to figure out in terms of rules and logistics, but one of the easiest to code and create a graphical style for. Perhaps because I'm a natural/animal person myself and have always preferred those kinds of color schemes and illustrations.

The game is a unique mix between cooperative and competitive play, while using dominoes in a few ways I've rarely seen before :p It turned into a warm and cozy little game about building a zoo, with more than enough strategic depth to want to keep creating new zoos.
