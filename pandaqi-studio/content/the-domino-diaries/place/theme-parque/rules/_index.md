Place the **Entrance Tile** in the center of the table. 

Shuffle the deck and hand each player **4 Tiles**. Each player also picks a color and receives all its **Pawns**.

Finally, place 4 Tiles faceup next to the deck: this is the **market**.

{{% /rules-double-view %}}

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

As soon as only **1 player remains who has pawns**, that player takes the final turn of the game. 

Otherwise, the game ends immediately as soon as the **market is empty** (and can't be refilled).

Everybody scores their claimed attractions. **Highest score wins!**

{{% rules-block heading="Gameplay" icon="action" %}}

From start player, take clockwise turns until done. 

Each turn has three simple steps (in this order): PLAY, CLAIM, DRAW.

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

You **must** play 2 dominoes (if possible). They must be placed **separated** ( = not connected to each other).

{{% remark %}}
With 5+ players, you can consider playing 1 domino per turn.
{{% /remark %}}

The placement rules are ...
* Must **connect** to the existing board. (No overlap. Holes are fine.)
* Path endings **don't need to match**: they can be a dead end or run off into the void. That is, _unless_ the domino part to which they're connected has a path of the same type.
* A **queue** can have exactly one connection to a **regular path**, and one connection to an **attraction**. Any other connections (to a different queue type, both ends to a regular path, etcetera) are disallowed.

{{% rules-block heading="Claim" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="gameplay_claim.webp" alt="Example of how to claim a Scorable Item (after your turn)." split="leftheavy" %}}

You **may** claim a "scorable item" on a domino (see [scoring](#scoring)) by placing your Pawn on it.

Everything can only be claimed once.

When you place your final Pawn, you stay in the game. On subsequent turns, however, you only play **1 domino**, and **don't refill** your hand.

{{% /rules-double-view %}}

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Draw" %}}

Finally, draw tiles from the market until you have 4 hand tiles again. Refill the market (from deck) after each draw.

{{% rules-block id="scoring" heading="Scoring" icon="score" %}}

In these rules, **nearby** refers to all 8 neighbors (horizontally, vertically, diagonally).

Tiles come in 4 varieties.
* **Paths**: regular, queue1 (_common_) and queue2 (_rare_). (The two queue types are **not** the same and can't be mixed.)
* **Decoration**: modifies their surroundings. (Recognizable by their _lack_ of number or icon.)
* **Attractions**: only score when connected to a regular path through a **queue**. It scores the **length of its longest queue** multiplied by its **score factor**.
* **Stalls**: only score when **nearby a regular path**. It scores whatever it says.

{{< rules-image src="scoring.webp" alt="Examples of all different elements on tiles and how they score." >}}

As you see, only Attractions and Stalls are "scorable items". They might have **requirements** (text starting with "If"): if not met, they don't score anything.

Finally, some deadend paths have a special icon: **tunnel**. It connects to any other tunnel.

Below are all (special) tiles that can appear in the base game.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or want to tweak it a little to fit your group? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Shared Spaces" %}}

This variant creates more cooperation towards building high-scoring attractions. It was kept out of the base game to simplify that.

* Players may also claim an **empty queue spot**, so long as the queue isn't finished yet.
* Pawns placed that way only score **half** of the attraction's points (rounded down).
* You may also move that pawn later, but only to a different **unfinished queue**. This replaces your usual claim action that round.

Other ways to create a **"friendlier"** game of Theme Parque are ...

* To play in teams.
* Or to print the pawns twice so everyone can claim 6 things. 
* Or to allow _2 (different) players_ to claim the same Attraction.
* Or to allow your _2 dominoes_ to be _connected_ (when placed in the same turn).

{{% remark %}}
I'm sorry, I always make my games really cutthroat by default and then offer friendlier variants ;)
{{% /remark %}}

If you want to make the game even **harder**, though, add these rules.

* Queues only count if they connect to a regular path _which is connected to the entrance_.
* After claiming an attraction, you're not allowed to extend its queue anymore.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Rollercooper" %}}

This expansion allows playing the game completely **cooperatively**! You win or lose together.

During **setup**,

* Everyone's hand cards are open.
* Create a deck with the **Event** cards. (Leave out Events with higher scores for a simpler game.)

At the start of each round ( = it's the start player's turn again), reveal the next Event.

* This instantly triggers a special rule that's valid for the entire upcoming round.
* It also adds a new challenge that the group must fulfill.

{{% remark %}}
You can opt to ignore the special rules for a simpler first game with this expansion.
{{% /remark %}}

There are two types of challenges:

* WIN: If you match this condition _at any time_, remove this card. You completed the challenge!
* LOSE: If you match this condition _when the next Event reveals_, "collect" this card ( = place it facedown). If you collected 3 LOSE cards, you **instantly lose the game**.

If you reach the end of the game, and you have **no uncompleted events**, you **beat the game**! Otherwise, sum the _score_ on all cards you completed. Higher score is better.

Finally, some clarifications on terms used in the events.

* The term "is free" means that it doesn't count as a domino placement during your turn. You _may_ still count it, if you wish. It doesn't need to be separate from your other dominoes.
* To "ignore" a type of tile simply means that you should pretend it doesn't exist, and that its space is just a blank one.

{{% rules-block heading="Wishneyland Parki" %}}

This adds a few more attractions, decoration and stalls. These are the "simpler" additions to the game, with one-liner rules and often no special requirements.

<div id="rules-table-wishneyland"></div>

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Unibearsal Honeyos" %}}

This adds a few more attractions, decoration and stalls. These are the slightly "harder" additions to the game, which often score in very unique ways or have strict requirements before scoring.

<div id="rules-table-unibearsal"></div>

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Raging Rollercoasters" %}}

This adds **rollercoasters** to the game! Rollercoasters are attractions that must be created from _multiple_ parts.

The possible rollercoaster parts are: Station, Straight, Bend, Tunnel.

* Every **Station** tile can be claimed by a Pawn. Yes, a single rollercoaster with multiple stations can be claimed _multiple times_ (by different players).
* **Rollercoaster parts must match**. If a tile has an open-ended rollercoaster track, you can _only_ play tiles connected to it that continue the rollercoaster track properly.
* **Queues must be connected to stations.** You can't attach a path to any other coaster part.
* **Tunnels continue the coaster from another tunnel.** It can only continue from a tunnel that it hasn't used yet on its entire track. 

{{< rules-image src="rollercoasters.webp" alt="Example of how to build a rollercoaster and how to score one." >}}

A rollercoaster only scores points if it has at least one station and it is a loop (it returns where it started).

> **Rollercoaster Score** = "Length of rollercoaster" x "Length of queue"
