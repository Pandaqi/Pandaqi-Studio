## Setup

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="setup.webp" alt="Example of how to setup a new game." >}}

Create a deck with all **Role** dominoes. Shuffle and deal each player 1 Role. Once revealed, also give each player their corresponding **Starting Dominoes**.

Start the **Shared Map** in the center of the table by combining the Starting Dominoes of _all Roles_ (even those not in the current game) however you like.

All players also start their **Personal Map** by placing their second Starting Domino before them.



## Objective

This game is a mix of cooperative and competitive by default. Still, you must choose if you play as a group (cooperative) or against each other (competitive). 

These rules explain the cooperative version first; at Variants, you can read the small changes to make it competitive.

You **lose** the game once a single player has failed **3 Missions**.

You **win** the game if you manage to complete **3 Missions per player** before that happens. (For example, in a 3-player game, this means completing 3x3 = 9 Missions to win.)

Your final score is the strength of the _weakest_ player. Higher is obviously better!


## Gameplay

Play happens in rounds. Each round has three steps: DRAW, PLACE, and REPORT.

### Draw

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="gameplay_draw.webp" alt="Example the DRAW step of a round: present dominoes and personal mission." >}}

Draw 2 times as many dominoes as there are players (from the deck). Place them faceup in a row on the table: the **Domino Market**.

Each player also receives a new **Mission Domino**. 

Some Missions have the **secret eye**. This means the Mission must be kept _secret_. You may discuss and strategize together, but not communicate this Mission.



### Place

From start player, take clockwise turns until the Domino Market is empty.

On your turn, **pick 1 domino** (from the market) and **place it**.

* You may place it either in your **Personal Map** or the **Shared Map**.
* It must attach to the existing map (and not overlap). All maps have a maximum size of 8x8.
* On your **Personal Map**: paths must match, terrain does not.
* On the **Shared Map**: terrains must match, paths do not.
* Crucially, if an icon is present on a Role card, **only that player** may handle dominoes showing that icon.

Picking and placing a domino is _required_. Only do nothing if you _can't_ use any of the remaining dominoes.

{{< rules/rules-image src="gameplay_claim.webp" alt="Examples of the CLAIM step of a round: valid placements and domino handling per player." >}}


### Report

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="gameplay_report.webp" alt="Example of the REPORT step of a round: check if missions fulfilled, handle reward/penalty." >}}

Take turns in the order of the **role numbers**. (Low to high; every role has a unique number.)

Every player checks if their **Mission Domino** is fulfilled. If so, place it faceup in a shared "Success Pile". If not, they place the domino facedown before them.

> If a player has 3 facedown Missions ( = 3 failed rounds), they're disowned and must leave the family.


The strength you need to have (in certain areas) is always _dynamic_: it depends on the current state of the board. If a mission shows _the same icon_ multiple times, you must only satisfy the _highest number_ of those options. 

Some missions also give a reward for succeeding or penalty for failing.



## Scoring & Pathing

In this game, the _scores_ and _pathing_ of each Player's map are the most important parts. 

Why? Because only **Capital icons** actually do something. The other icons _modify_ what the Capital does if they're on a path connected to it.

A Capital icon is bigger and marked by castle icons on all 4 sides. In the base game, the only Capitals are the Role Icons and the white Neutral icon.

The **score** of every player **is their Role's strength**. For example, if the Brother of Warfare has a map that scores 8, then the current strength of your empire's Military is 8.

{{< rules/rules-image src="scoring_and_pathing.webp" alt="Examples on how to score and check paths on your personal map." >}}

Calculating your score has three steps.

* Find all Capital icons on your Personal Map. Each of them is worth +1 by default.
* Check any paths attached to it, starting from that Capital and moving away. 
  * Icons on that path _modify_ the score of that icon, such as doubling it. 
  * Any Capital on the path **stops** the path. (Otherwise the path simply stops whenever it can't go further.)
* Finally, _multiply_ the score of your Personal Map by the size of your **Province** on the Shared Map.
  * Your Province is the group of tiles with your Role's terrain attached to your Starting Domino.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
In a way, your Personal Maps are "zoomed-in" versions of your spot in the Shared Map.
{{% /rules/rules-remark %}}

As such, you need each other to complete missions, and their numbers are always about _all the maps (combined)_. 

If your mission requires 5 Military, for example, then ensure the Brother of Warfare actually produces that amount. You have enough Military for everyone? Great! If not, the owning Role decides how to distribute the strength they have.

Any Roles **not in the game** assume the same score as the highest-scoring player. They also decide how to distribute that power.


## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or want to tweak it a little to fit your group? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variants: Game Difficulty

**Feel the game is too hard?** 
* Enable the "Power" on each role. You can use this ability during your turn.
* Allow the Shared Map to be more freeform: "When placing a domino, only 1 Terrain needs to match with neighbors (instead of all)"

**Feel the game is too easy?** 
* Enable the "Report" action on each role. This punishes bad behavior or placement, or rewards cooperative behavior and good placement. You _check_ if you satisfy this requirement at the start of the Report phase.
* Any Roles not in the game assume the score of the _lowest_ scoring player (instead of the highest scoring).


### Variant: Competitive

**For a COMPETITIVE game:** most of the game stays the same. Only the following changes need to be made.

* The game **ends** as soon as one player must **leave the empire** ( = they have 3 failed missions).
* All players score themselves. The player who left, however has a -8 penalty on their strength. **Highest score wins!**
* All Missions are _public_. (Ignore the secret eye.)
* You can't withhold power or anything. If someone needs 5 Military from you, and you have it, they get it.


### Variants: Variety & Strategy

**Want to use all roles, always?** You can! Simply deal all Roles at the start, so certain players get multiple of them. This changes nothing else about the game. (This is merely left out of the base game to make it simpler to play your first game.)

**For an even more tactical game:** include the following two changes.

Change 1) Also count the Shared Map when determining your score/strength! The full formula becomes:
* Check your Role's Capital icons on both your individual and Shared Map.
* Multiply the _sum_ of that by your Province size, divided by 2.

Change 2) You're now allowed to grow your Province by connecting different _"patches"_ with your Role's terrain using paths. (So they're connected to your Starting Domino by path, not by terrain.)

**For a more chaotic game:** start your Personal Map _empty_. Your score can never go below 1. (So your strength, at the start of the game, is 1.)


### Goblin Grandma

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_goblin_grandma.webp" alt="Example of the Corrupter icon and how to use it." >}}

This expansion makes external threats (from Goblins) more immediate and powerful.

It introduces the **Corrupter Capital**. This can be used by any player.

> All People icons attached to a Corrupter (via a path) become Goblins instead.


This number of Goblins is used in missions to scale their threat.

It also introduces missions with the **"Attack" penalty**. An Attack means the following.

* Find all **open-ended paths** in your Personal Map. (Paths that lead nowhere, pointing out of your map.)
* Goblins attack all those locations! Remove each domino which has one or more open-ended paths from your map.


### Proximity Papa

This expansion adds more icons that can appear on tiles, all of which have "proximity" powers. That is, they change score or only do something depending on the icons/paths _around_ them or _close to them_.

This expansion also adds **Events**.
* During setup, create a deck of all Event dominoes. Shuffle and place facedown.
* At the start of each round, reveal the top Event. It has a power or rules change that applies to this entire round.


### Directional Daddy

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_directional_daddy.webp" alt="Example of directed paths and how to use them." >}}

This expansion adds paths with arrows (sometimes). 

> When following a path, if you hit a directional path that points the OPPOSITE way, you must **stop**.

In other words, you can only count paths connected to Capitals insofar as they consistently point the same direction. 

If a path has no arrows, it is always fine---it is considered "both directions".



### Machine Mama

{{<  rules-image-sidebar src="expansion_machine_mama.webp" alt="Example of what it means to be connected on the Shared Map." >}}

This expansion is about connecting _players_ and using the Personal Maps to feed into a bigger engine (or "machine").

It introduces a few new icons and missions (as usual), but also introduces a few big and crucial rule changes.

You can only share your strength freely with another player if you are **connected on the Shared Map**. (That is, there must be a path between a Capital in _your Province_ and a Capital in _their Province_.)


If unconnected, you can still share your strength with someone, but that is the **only player** with whom you may share it (this round).

Every round, You may choose to give your _power_ or your _role icon_ to another player. 
* Only players to whom you're connected (on the Shared Map) can borrow it.
* This means _you_ can't use your own power or handle dominoes with your own icon anymore, but the player who borrowed it can.
