## Credits

The fonts used are **Cute Dino** (headings) and **Tinos** (body text). Some generative image AI was used. Everything else (code, idea, rules, illustrations) is entirely mine.

This was the second idea for the collection. I was in a bit of a rush and wanted to make this game as a "joke" for my sister's birthday. (Long story short: she'd found a place in the Netherlands called Dinoland, thinking it was a theme park we could visit for her birthday, then it turned out to be a really small venue with a _maximum_ age limit. So we couldn't go.)

I started thinking about dinosaurs, the famous asteroid, and how to blend it all into a very _simple_ game I could make before her birthday. That process turned into this game, which ended up being far better than I imagined and more than good enough to release publicly!

It has the simplest ruleset of all the games, because placement of dominoes is almost completely _free_. The asteroid mechanic adds a bit of complexity, but not much, while you get a clear goal or "time bomb" in return. Just like stories, it feels good to have a game work towards a "climax", and I'll probably use this technique for more games in the future.

Because of its simplicity, I decided to also make it the most colorful, textless, and therefore most suitable to play with young children too.

(And yes, as I also mentioned at the Theme Park domino game, the names of the fonts used give insight into my incredibly professional process for selecting them. I basically searched for fonts with "dino" or "dinosaurs" in their name, or something that _sounded similar_ ... such as Tinos. Of course, I still check if it's readable and looks good, but it's honestly impressive how often this just works out. You can search for the most specific or random of keywords and find a cool, thematic font just sideways of that.)
