Manage your own floor in the same skyscraper as everyone else. A [Domino Diaries](/the-domino-diaries/) game.

## Background

This game is perhaps the most "peaceful" of all the domino games. Yes, there's still a lot of interaction, and you can be mean to other players in small ways. But everyone has _their own little floor to manage_, instead of a shared map. And nobody can touch your floor! So you can place your dominoes in relative peace and just try to design a floor that the highest-scoring tenants want to visit.

By placing all players inside the same building, you can even piggyback. If the player on the floor below you builds a pool, you don't have to anymore: just build a staircase to them. I tried to use this experimental idea---everyone is a different floor in the same building---to make a really unique and fun domino game.

As always, have fun with it, and let me know what you think, both the good and the bad.
