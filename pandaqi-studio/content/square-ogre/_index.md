**Square Ogre** is a cute **puzzle game** with the simplest possible controls (swipe in a direction to move that way). Help Ogre improve his eyesight, so he can finally find the cave exit.

It's based upon a children's story and therefore suitable **for all ages**. The simple controls allow puzzles to stay small and uncluttered, with the solution often hiding in plain sight ...

**500 unique puzzles** across **20 worlds** will entertain you for tens of hours!

Start of a new world? A brand new mechanic to explore! This makes the game easy to learn, yet varied and challenging.

You'll be opening doors, flying from trampolines, skidding across icy floors, collecting mysterious scrolls, and most importantly ... 

... improving his eyesight. The world is so beautiful! There is so much to see! Square eyes just aren't enough to take it all in. Would you help Square Ogre add some more corners to that eye?

<!-- Section 4: Round Ogre -->
{{< figure url="squareogre_h4" alt="Round Ogre" >}}

The story of Square Ogre doesn't end here! 

[Round Ogre](https://pandaqi.com/round-ogre) has no trouble seeing, with her perfectly round eyes, but ... that creates a whole other sort of trouble.

She's just too enthusiastic about life! She wants to see it all! She can barely keep her eyes closed, but when you finally manage to do so ... well, that's awkward, she might be sleepwalking for quite some time.

This game is an extension to an _interactive picture book_ I published in the Netherlands: [Vierkante Ogre (prentenboek)](https://tiamopastoor.com/books/vierkante-ogre)

If you're Dutch and like (the look of) this game, check out this book and support my work!

<!-- Section 6: The Curse of the Ogres -->
{{< figure url="squareogre_h6" alt="The Curse of the Ogres" >}}

Long ago, Ogres roamed our lands. They were a welcome sight, a happy sight, as they brought joy everywhere with their odd games and interesting sports.

But then they disappeared.

Dear reader, you will learn that a terrible and mysterious curse plagues the Ogrefolk: as they grow older, they become blind! They've tried to escape their cave for centuries now, but nobody can find the exit with their blurry sight.

Until one day Square Ogre wakes up from a nightmare ... and finds himself touched by the curse. His sight becomes fuzzy and any glance at a lamp causes him to lose the game. He can't run through the halls anymore, can't play with this friend _Round Ogre_, can't do anything!

What's up with this curse? Where does it come from and what does it do? Will he ever be able to see his friend again?

Will the Ogres ever find the exit?
