**Package Party** is a local multiplayer (“couch co-op”) game for literally anyone. Gather your friends, family, kids, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbors, neighbor’s dog – and start working together to deliver packages!

Up to 4 people must cooperate and coordinate to get those pesky boxes where they belong &hellip; without damaging them too much or arriving two hours too late.

Sounds easy, I hear you say. I could do that alone, I hear you think.

Oh, you sweet summer child.

There will be &hellip;
- Conveyor belts
- Ravines
- Moving bridges
- Gates that somehow always seem closed
- Security cameras with lasers that kill you (people and their security these days &hellip;)
- Trampolines
- Catapults
- Farm animals that get in the way
- Police that doesn’t like it when you run a traffic light because you’re in a hurry
- Orders from Santa Claus himself
- A mix of many genres: action, platforming, stealth and puzzle solving
- And much more!

Do you need a party game? Or a game you could play with people who’ve never played a game before? (Or those who always say "nah, I'm just not that into gaming"?)

Do you want to spend quality time with your dear ones, and do you have 1-4 players and a (somewhat) working computer?

Then Package Party might be the game for you.

This game was designed to be _cooperative_ and _local multiplayer_

Why did I do this? Because I think local multiplayer games are awesome and the strongest form of gaming.

Games like these allow you to connect with anyone (friends, family, partner, stranger on the bus) and have a fun time together, in real life. This is, in my opinion, what games are meant to be.

Package Party is so easy to pick up that literally anyone can join in the fun: gamers and non-gamers alike.

For example, the first two worlds of the game only require a <em>single button</em> (for moving around).

Any time a new mechanic is introduced, it's explained with quick animated video tutorials, right when you need it.

But don't let that fool you. As the game progresses, only the most capable and talented delivery workers will be able to get that three star score!

The game is currently _paused_. The first two worlds are finished, playable and enjoyable (for free). Then it stops.

It was too hard to develop this game _alone_, so I'm looking for a team to finish it and make this a reality. Until then, I'm creating smaller games _and_ gaining more experience and skills.
