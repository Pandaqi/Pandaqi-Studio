The Sheepe are a simple folk. They are born with a random shape and one burning desire in their woolly heart: **cross the finish line before the others!**

When they take their first rolls, though, they soon find out not every shape is equally suited for rolling. And in a weird twist of faith, the player in **last place** magically turns into a **wolf** that eats the others!

**Rolling in the Sheepe** is a simple, light-hearted local multiplayer game for 1-6 players of all ages. 

Roll your sheepe to the finish. Try not to get sliced into many tinier sheepe along the way, or become The Unrollable Triangle, or land on a spike, or miss that jump ten times, or &mdash; well, you know, just try to roll better than the others?

</div>

{{% section-centered heading="" %}}
This game is playable on **Windows / Mac / Linux** with both **Controllers & Keyboard**. (In any combination. Four keyboard players at most.)

Each player only has two buttons: roll left and roll right. Rolling was never easier!

Of course, for the really tricky bleaters among us, you can do more than roll. Quick press both buttons to do a **quick jump**. Hold both buttons to **float** in the air. Many of the terrains play with your physics, such as the reverse gravity or the spiderman that clings to walls.

For this game, I tried a new method to make learning the game easier. When the game boots, you have only two options:

* **A tutorial mode.** When chosen, you play a special course designed to teach the basic buttons and objective, but nothing else.
* **A free play mode.** Anything can appear. But, before a new thing is added, a tutorial image also appears (right inside the level) that explains what's coming. 

<div class="limit-width">
{{< video url="sheepe_video_3" >}}
</div>

This way, you only need to play the tutorial once. Then you can free play, without requiring any upfront reading/learning, but it will be different every time and use all content of the game!

If you did (not) like this system, let me know! It's something I experiment with.

Additionally, the game has several mechanics to bring players closer together.  The most important ones are ...

**Locks:** a minigame that the player(s) in the lead must solve before they can continue. They aren't just a catch-up trick, they are a _core part of the game_ and a challenge by itself!

​**Teleports:​** if you're too far behind, or did not move for too long, you're teleported forward. This does incur a ​_time penalty​_ though, so even if you reach the finish first, you might not necessarily have the best time!

This game has:
* 25 terrains. (While moving over them, their effect is active on you.)
* 20 locks. (See explanation above.)
* 40 obstacles. (Solid tiles can have obstacles on them, such as deadly spikes or trampolines.)

The game _started_ as part of my "One Week Game" series. 

But it became way bigger (and much different) than I originally imagined. And so I ended up working on it way longer, and eventually decided to become serious about it and bring the game to a paid release.

(Also, the original core idea ended up not fitting with my other ideas, so I had to redo the whole project from scratch. That original core idea eventually became [Carving Pumpkins & Dwarfing Dumplings](https://pandaqi.com/carving-pumpkins-and-dwarfing-dumplings).)
