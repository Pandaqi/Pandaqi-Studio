In an unexpected collaborative effort, _Santa Claus_, the _Easter Bunny_, a bunch of birds, and the _Sombrero Hombres_ have joined forces!

Children around the world have ordered a variety of presents, all egg-shaped, coincidentally.

You have one task: bring those eggs to their basket. Eggs, however, fall from the sky, and break when they hit the ground. 

Fortunately, you have hands to catch them! But ... they are hidden underneath your overly large sombreros. Well, guess you'll have to use that to catch the eggs instead, and guide them safely home.

* **What?** Local cooperative multiplayer for 1&ndash;4 players. 
* **Input?** Keyboard or controller, any combo. 
* **Complexity?** Real simple. You only need one button: moving around.  (There's a second button, but only for specific powerups, and you're reminded when it's applicable.)
* **Eggs?** We've got plenty! 27 different egg types that could appear in your game, with their own look and specialty. 
* **Arenas?** Well, not as many as eggs, but still a few! 5 different places to visit, each with slight twists on the rules and their own unique soundtrack.

This game was made for the New Horizons game jam. I found the general theme of "positivity and new beginnings" a great one and wanted to join!

After some thinking, I wanted to make a game about eggs. They are the start of a new life, a new beginning. (They are also quite cute and easy to model for my _very_ limited 3D skills.)

But I also wanted a game that didn't take itself too seriously. I didn't want to make another "thinky" puzzle game, or "platformer with a metaphore about life", or something. 

So I thought back to the games I used to play as a kid, and "keep-up" ( = keep a ball or something up in the air for as long as possible) was one of them. So I decided: why not combine both ideas, and make a game about keeping eggs in the air?

That's what this game is :)

Any **feedback** (at [schoolofpanda@gmail.com](mailto:schoolofpanda@gmail.com)) is more than welcome!

I've written a devlog about the whole process: [Ho Ho Sombrero (devlog)](/blog/videogames/game-jams/devlog-ho-ho-sombrero)

This game was made using Godot (game engine), Blender (3D modelling), Affinity Designer (drawing and design), and Studio One (music). Fonts used are _Kavoon_ and _Bitter_, both available at Google Fonts.
