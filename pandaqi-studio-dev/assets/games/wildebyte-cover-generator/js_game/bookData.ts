    blurb: "The game Frustrated Pigeons is not how Wildebyte remembers it. It's worse. It's barely played. As they investigate the reason, they stumble upon a special type of Ludramagic that comes at a great cost. Mastery means enormous power, failure means a devastating curse. When their biggest nightmare suddenly becomes reality, Wildebyte must fix the game's flaws while at their weakest, swimming in unknown seas.",
