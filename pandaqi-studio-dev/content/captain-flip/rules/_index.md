Create one deck of tiles and shuffle it. Place a 5x5 grid of facedown tiles, but turn the main diagonals faceup. (For an easier game, reduce the grid to 4x4.)

The game ends when the **map is completely cleared**. (There are no more tiles on the table and it cannot be refilled from the deck.) Players sum the points on all tiles they scored: **highest score wins**!

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done.

{{% rules-block heading="On your turn" %}}

On your turn, you **flip a tile** (faceup <=> facedown).
* Flipped faceup? Take its **heart action** (if it has one).
* Flipped facedown? Take its **skull action** (if it has one).

The most common action allows you to **"score"** a tile. This means you ...
* Take the tile off the board to place it in your personal score pile.
* Then fill the gap with a new tile from the deck, always **faceup**.
* Crucially, you can **only score facedown tiles** and **not the tile you just flipped**. (Unless the action itself provides an exception.)

You can also clear the board in a second way. Any time an entire _row_ or _column_ is **faceup**, clear it from the board, and refill with facedown tiles from the deck.

Tiles have ...
* A **type**: the big icon in the center.
* A **score value**: the numbers left and right of the type. (The value is constant per type.)
* A **color/pattern** at the edges. (This is mostly relevant for the expansions.)
* Zero, one or two **actions**.

The possible action types are ...
* **Heart**: triggers when you flip the tile faceup.
* **Skull**: triggers when you flip the tile facedown.
* **Star**: a permanent power for when the tile is inside your score pile.

Actions are written in English on the tile itself. (Asking players to remember a myriad of icons is like turning this into a double-memory-game and proved too hard.)

When an action talks about a **row**, it means a straight row or column (from one end of the map to the other end)---you decide which of the two to use when taking the action.

That's it! Have fun!

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! It's recommended---but not required---to apply the expansions in order.

{{% rules-block heading="Sergeant Pattern" %}}

{{% rules-double-view src="expansion_sergeant_pattern.webp" alt="Simple examples of what color matches mean and how to handle them." %}}

You might have noticed that the tiles all have _colors_ as well. These come into play now.

> You can score _multiple tiles_ at the same time by making a **faceup pattern**: 3(+) tiles of the same color in a row. 

As before, a "row" means horizontally or vertically.

{{% /rules-double-view %}}

This expansion also adds a wrinkle to the **scoring rules**.
* Collect all tiles that are **cleared** from the map in a separate pile.
* The type that appears **the most** in this pile turns into minus points. 

> **Example**: Strawberry appears most often in the forcibly cleared tiles. They are usually worth 3 points; now each is -3 points. (Ties are allowed, turning multiple types into negative ones.)

{{% rules-block heading="Commander Swap" %}}

During **setup**, players get 3 tiles in their hand. 

Your **turn** now has two actions: flip a tile and swap a tile (in whatever order you want).

> **Swap a tile** means swapping a tile in your hand with a tile on the board. Its orientation (faceup or facedown) must stay the same.

DISCARDED EXPANSION (Major Rotation):


**\@IDEA:** **Some tiles can "skip over" others** or create more varied patterns in some other way. => Or do we simply use a "wildcard" color for that?

**@IDEA:** A pattern is also => 5 connected tiles that are all *different types*.

**@IDEA: Can rotation play a role?** So cards are only a pattern if connected with arrows. Or a card's action only executes on cards in the direction of its arrow. (And a common action is then to rotate cards.)
