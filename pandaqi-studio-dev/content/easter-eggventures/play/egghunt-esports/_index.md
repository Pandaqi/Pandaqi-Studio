As stated, this game is part of the Easter Eggventures project. It shares the fonts, style, and origins with all other games in the project. As such, for more information, check out the [Easter Eggventures overview page](/easter-eggventures/).

This game is probably the one that worked the fastest: at the very first playtest with others. I only needed to do some minor tweaks and balancing to get the game to its final version. It's perhaps the best and most intuitive "simulation" of a real Egg Hunt out of all the games.

I still didn't put it as the first ("simplest") game, though. Although the rules _are_ simple, you have 3 different possible actions on your turn and 3 action points to use for them. And in my experience, this just takes a bit longer to grasp for people who don't regularly play board games.
