Pick as many egg types as the number of players. Remove all tiles that are _not_ one of the chosen types from the game.
* Create a deck of all **Goal Tiles**. Shuffle and deal each player one in secret.
* Also create a deck of all **Egg Tiles**: this will be the draw pile.
* Each player draws 3 Egg Tiles to take into their hand.

Pick anyone to be start player.

The game ends after the round when the **draw pile runs out**. The player with the **most points wins**!

Play happens in rounds. 

At the start of each round,
* Draw **2 tiles** and place them faceup on the table. This is the start of this round's offer.
* All players **reveal** their hand tiles. Make sure everyone can take a good look.

Now begin with the start player and take clockwise turns. 

On your turn,
* Make your hand tiles secret again for the other players.
* Add one tile to the **offer** in the center of the table.
* Add one tile before you as your **bid**.

You may play the tiles both faceup and facedown ( = kept a secret from the other players). If you play one tile facedown, however, the other must be faceup. 

{{% remark %}}
In other words, you can **never** play **all** your tiles facedown.
{{% /remark %}}

Once everyone has taken their turn, figure out who wins this round.
* All players reveal their **bid** tile.
* The **highest number** collects all tiles inside the current offer.
* The **lowest number** becomes start player.
* All other bids just go back into their player's hands.

All players draw their hand back up to the hand limit. (Which is 3 tiles by default.) Next round!

Crucially, you only score points for collected eggs that are the same as your secret Goal Egg. Any other regular egg is worth nothing to you.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or feel like your group needs some tweaks to the game? Check out these variants and expansions.

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

To make the game **harder**, here are some standalone tweaks you can make.
* Only "reveal" your hand tiles _on your turn_, not all at the start of the round.
* Increase the number of tiles in your hand.
* Increase the number of eggs in the game. 
* Give players _two_ Goal Eggs (if material suffices). One scores plus points, the other negative points.

To give players **more choice**,
* After placing your 2 required tiles (1 offer, 1 bid), you may use your remaining hand tiles as well.
* Your **options** are to: keep them, add them to the offer, add them to your bid, or give them to another player.
* If your bid contains multiple tiles, then your final bid is simply the _sum_ of all those numbers. (If this leads to a tie, randomly but fairly distribute the offer among the tied winners.)

{{% rules-block heading="Special Eggs" %}}

This expansion adds **Special Eggs**. They should be added to the deck regardless of which regular types you decide to include.

They can be ...
* A fixed point value (positive or negative) you score at the end.
* An action that triggers when added to the offer.
* An action that triggers when checking the bids (i.e. who won the round).

Actions, however, only trigger if the tile was played _faceup_. If played facedown, they're just ignored.

Actions only care about the current round. They aren't permanent.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Powers & Handiceggs" %}}

During **setup**, also deal each player an **Eggstra Power** (public) and a **HandicEgg** (secret).

* You _may_ use your power once per turn.
* You _must_ comply with your handicap at all times.

There will be times when your handicap is simply not possible. (Example: you must play the same egg as one already in the offer, but the entire offer is facedown so you have nothing to go on!) In that case, just ignore the handicap.

It's allowed to add your power or handicap to the offer (for another player to win)! When you do,
* The tile must be added faceup.
* And only _one_ power or handicap can be added per round.
