Create a deck of all **Goal Tiles**. Shuffle and deal each player 2 in secret.

Distribute all **Egg Tiles** over the players as fairly as possible. (It's fine if some people have 1 more tile than others.)

Pick anyone to be start player.

The game ends once all players are **out of cards**. 

Each secret egg you collected that matches with your Goal Eggs scores you **+5 points**. Any other egg types you collected score **-1 point** each. The player with the **most points wins**!

Play happens in rounds. 

At the start of each round, the start player plays **2 faceup tiles** (from their hand). This begins the round's offer.

Now begin with the start player and take clockwise turns. 

On your turn,
* Play one tile before you as your **bid**.
* Play one tile to the **offer** in the center of the table. If this tile is currently the _highest number_ in the offer, you _must_ play another tile (to bid or offer).

You may play tiles both _faceup_ and _facedown_. You can, however,
* **Never** play **all** your tiles facedown (in one turn).
* Only play at most **5 tiles**.

Once everyone has taken their turn, figure out who wins this round.
* All players reveal their **bid** tile. 
* Check which egg type(s) appear the most in the offer. Every bid tile of the same type _inverts_ the auction. 
* The **highest number** wins. (In an inverted auction, of course, the **lowest number** wins.)
* The winner collects all offer tiles and becomes start player.
* All bids that were played _facedown_ go into the hand of the worst bidder. Any other bids are removed.

If you have multiple bid tiles, _sum_ their numbers for your final bid number. If this leads to a tie, nobody wins.

Next round!

Played the base game and ready for more? Or feel like your group needs some tweaks to the game? Check out these variants and expansions.

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

To make the game **easier**, here are some standalone tweaks you can make.
* All players reveal (at most) 5 tiles at the start of their turn. Those tiles are the only ones they're allowed to use this turn. This means the other players have more information.
* Simply give all players who did _not_ win the auction back their bid tile(s).
* Decrease the number of unique eggs in the game.

To make the game **harder**,
* Deal players only 1 Goal Egg.
* Allow at most 4 tiles to be played per turn.

To make the game **different**,
* If your bid type matches the majority, it **doesn't** invert the auction anymore. Instead, it only flips your own tile's numbers. For example, "58" becomes "85".
* Each type of egg that **appears multiple times** in all bids (e.g. there are duplicates) _inverts the auction_ instead.
* If you play a **doubled number** (11, 22, 33, ...) in any way (offer or bid), all players immediately give 5 hand tiles to the player on their left.

<!---
Other rules ideas:
* Duplicate bids are removed (on type, not number)? Or each duplicate inverts the auction once more?
* Doubled numbers (11,22,33,44,...) do something special?
* If you match majority, it doesn't invert the whole auction---it only flips the numbers on your own card. (So 58 becomes 85, for example.)

{{% rules-block heading="Special Eggs" %}}

This expansion adds **Special Eggs**. They should be added to the deck regardless of which regular types you decide to include.

They can be ...
* A fixed point value (positive or negative) you score at the end.
* An action that triggers when added to the offer.
* An action that triggers when checking the bids (i.e. who won the round).

Actions, however, only trigger if the tile was played _faceup_. If played facedown, they're just ignored.

Actions only care about the current round. They aren't permanent.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Powers & Handiceggs" %}}

During **setup**, also deal each player an **Eggstra Power** (public) and a **HandicEgg** (secret).

* You _may_ use your power once per turn.
* You _must_ comply with your handicap at all times.

There will be times when your handicap is simply not possible. (Example: you must play the same egg as one already in the offer, but the entire offer is facedown so you have nothing to go on!) In that case, just ignore the handicap.

It's allowed to add your power or handicap to the offer (for another player to win)! When you do,
* The tile must be added faceup.
* And only _one_ power or handicap can be added per round.
