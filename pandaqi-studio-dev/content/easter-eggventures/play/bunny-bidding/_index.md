As stated, this game is part of the Easter Eggventures project. It shares the fonts, style, and origins with all other games in the project. As such, for more information, check out the [Easter Eggventures overview page](/easter-eggventures/).

This was originally the simplest idea and the one I made first. Just a few tiles with eggs and numbers, and a simple rule about bidding? Great!

Then I made it, tested it, tested it again, and the simple rules just didn't create a fun game at all. I had to twist them, turn them around, try variations, and expand the ruleset with a few more tweaks to actually get the game I was looking for. (Though the material stayed small and simple all the way through, so that's nice.)

This made the game one of the more difficult ones to learn and grasp in the end. Not because it has a lot of rules, no, but because those rules are very exact and almost ... mathematical?
