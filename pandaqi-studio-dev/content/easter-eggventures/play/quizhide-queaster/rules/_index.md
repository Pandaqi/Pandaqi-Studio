Place 25 **Room Tiles** in any layout. If unsure, just use a 5x5 grid.

Divide the players into two teams: **Hiders** and **Seekers**. It's usually recommended to only have a single Hider. The Seekers leave the room (or close their eyes), while the Hiders hide eggs.

* For each empty slot (white shape with black stroke) in a room, place a facedown egg.
* Then cover it up with a faceup obstacle.

The Hiders draw 3 Hint Cards each from the deck, to hold in their hand.

Once done, all Seekers return and place their pawn at different entrances to the map. Finally, they draw a random **Score Card** and place it faceup before them.

The game **ends** as soon as **all eggs have been found**. 

Each Seeker calculates their **score** by checking the eggs they collected. The point value of each is determined by their Score Card. 

* You can play cooperatively and sum all the scores. The higher, the better!
* Or you can play competitively: highest score wins.

The Seekers take clockwise turns until done. 

On your turn, you first receive one **Clue Card** from the Hiders. (After which that Hider draws their hand back up to 3.)

Then you must do one of two possible actions.
* **Walk**: take at most 3 steps to an adjacent room.
* **Search**: collect the egg underneath 1 obstacle in your room.

If the Hiders think there are no good eggs for a Player anymore, they can say so. The Player gets no more turns or clues until the end of the game.

IDEAS:
* Some obstacles require _two_ players to be in the room to lift them. (These obstacles are already in base material. We can just say "any obstacle that takes more than 2 spaces requires 2 players.")
* At the end of each round, increase the round counter. Some eggs will now _spoil_: the hiders should remove them from the game. => I keep thinking this is problematic, because the Hiders will forget exactly what or where they are. It's easier if they get a phase after _every round_ (and the eggs are faceup anyway) to check all of them. But is that fun?
  * Maybe it's better if it's a more general rule like "the players pick one egg in a room where they are. It spoils and is removed without scoring."
  * PERHAPS BETTER IDEA: the spoil counter should be on the ROOMS or the OBSTACLES.
* Multiple-storied buildings connected with staircases => this is the "garden" expansion that also adds garden tiles. It's recommended to keep rooms and gardens as their own group, instead of randomly alternating them.
* Special Eggs => when collected, you just take its unique action.
  * Such as giving the Hiders an extra opportunity to check what's underneath what.
