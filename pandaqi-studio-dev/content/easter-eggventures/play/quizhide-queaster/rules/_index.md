Place 16 **Room Tiles** in any layout. If unsure, just use a 4x4 grid.

Divide the players into two teams: **1 Hider** and the rest are **Seekers**.

First, the Hider hides their eggs.

* For each empty slot (white shape with colorful stroke) in a room, place a facedown egg.
* Then cover it up with a faceup obstacle.

Finally, the Hider draws **5 Clue Cards** from the deck into their hand.

Once done, all Seekers place their pawn on a random tile. Finally, they draw a random **Score Card** and place it faceup before them.

The game **ends** as soon as **all players have left the map**.

Each Seeker calculates their **score** by checking the eggs they collected. The point value of each is determined by their Score Card. **The higher, the better!**

The Seekers take clockwise turns until done. 

On your turn, you first receive one **Clue Card** from the Hider. 
* The Hider may place the Clue Card before you any way they want. (On its own, on top of another, rotated, facedown, ...)
* Then the Hider draws their hand back up to 5.

Of course, the goal of the Hider is to provide Clues as to _where_ eggs may be hidden that will score you the most points.

Now you take 3 actions. The possible actions are ...
* **Walk**: move your pawn to an adjacent room (not diagonally).
* **Search**: collect the egg underneath an obstacle in your current room.

For every 3 Clue Cards you receive, however, you must have Searched at least _once_.

If the Hider thinks there are no good eggs for a Player anymore, they can say so. The Player leaves the map: they get no more turns.

Once every Seeker has received 3 Clue Cards, the Hider may **refresh their memory**. They pick 2 rows or columns and look at all remaining eggs there.

On **high player counts** (6+ players), you can increase board size (e.g. 5x5) and pick multiple Hiders.

For a **faster game**, you can take simultaneous turns. The Hider simply deals out Clue Cards as they please and players can puzzle and walk around simultaneously.

For a **higher pressure game**, add an extra rule for when the game ends: once every player has received **6 Clue Cards**. (In a 2-player game, make this 9 Clue Cards.)

You can play the game **competitively**. Each player only scores themselves, and highest score wins. In that case, pick an unbiased Hider.

IDEAS FOR EXPANSIONS:
* Some obstacles require _two_ players to be in the room to lift them. (These obstacles are already in base material. We can just say "any obstacle that takes more than 2 spaces requires 2 players.")
* At the end of each round, increase the round counter. Some eggs will now _spoil_: the hiders should remove them from the game. => I keep thinking this is problematic, because the Hiders will forget exactly what or where they are. It's easier if they get a phase after _every round_ (and the eggs are faceup anyway) to check all of them. But is that fun?
  * Maybe it's better if it's a more general rule like "the players pick one egg in a room where they are. It spoils and is removed without scoring."
  * PERHAPS BETTER IDEA: the spoil counter should be on the ROOMS or the OBSTACLES.
* Multiple-storied buildings connected with staircases => this is the "garden" expansion that also adds garden tiles. It's recommended to keep rooms and gardens as their own group, instead of randomly alternating them.
* Special Eggs => when collected, you just take its unique action.
  * Such as giving the Hiders an extra opportunity to check what's underneath what.
  * Something to swap Score Cards?
  * Early refresher?
  * Map expansion?
