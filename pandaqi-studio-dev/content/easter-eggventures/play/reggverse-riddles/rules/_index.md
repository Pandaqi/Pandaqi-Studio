Place random **Map Tiles** in any reasonable map shape. When unsure, just use a 5x5 grid.

Pick which egg types you want to include. When unsure, pick as many as the number of players. For each type you want to include, place all its **Egg Tokens** on the table with enough empty space next to it.

All players pick a Pawn and place it at a random location. Finally, deal all players a hand of 4 **Rule Tiles**.

The game **ends** when all egg supplies have run out. The player who scored the most **eggs** wins.

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, you always **play 1 tile** (from your hand). 

There are two ways to use a tile.
* Add it next to an egg pile to use its _rule_. To do so, place it next to _or_ on top of an existing rule.
* Discard it to use its _movement_. If so, move your pawn as described on the tile. You cannot move off the map.

At the end of your turn, check the row of rules for each egg type. They tell you where eggs of that type are currently hidden.
* For each egg that matches your current tile ( = where your Pawn is), grab 1 of that type from the pile.
* An egg may _never_ have a ruleset that causes it to match NONE or ALL tiles.
* If a pile runs out, also remove its rules. (That type is now out of the game.)

Finally, draw your hand back up to 4 tiles.
