Place random **Map Tiles** in any reasonable map shape. When unsure, just use a 4x4 grid.

All players pick a Pawn and place it at a random location. Deal all players a hand of 4 **Regular Tiles**.

For each egg type, create a pile with all its **Egg Tokens**. Then place one **Regular Tile** next to each.

For a shorter game, include fewer unique egg types, or just fewer tokens per egg.

The game **ends** when all egg piles have run out. The player who scored the **most eggs wins**.

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, you always **play 1 tile** (from your hand). 

Firstly, you use its **movement** (top side), if possible.
* Pretend your pawn is in the center (brown smiley). Move your pawn to one of the green locations on the tile. 
* You can't move off the map.
* You can't share a tile with another player.
* Finally, take any one egg (from a pile or tile) and _drop it_ at your final location. 

Secondly, you use its **rule** (bottom side). 
* Place the tile next to _or_ on top of an existing rule tile. 
* Each egg can have at most 3 unique rules.

When considering a tile's movement or rule, it is always from **your perspective**. For example, the "bottom half" of the board will be different for different players, as they sit around the table.

At the **end of your turn**, check the row of rules for each egg type. They tell you where eggs of that type are currently hidden.
* For each egg that matches your current tile ( = where your Pawn is), collect 1 of that type (from pile or tile).
* You **can't**, however, collect any egg type that is already physically present on your current tile.
* An egg may _never_ have a ruleset that causes it to match _none_ or _all_ tiles.
* If a pile runs out, also remove its rules. (It can't be collected anymore, even if it's still on tiles.)

Finally, draw your hand back up to 4 tiles.

Played the base game and ready for more? Check out these simple expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Action Tiles" %}}

This expansion adds **Action Tiles**.

These tiles do not show two things (movement and rule), but only one thing: a unique **action**. When played, execute it.

{{% rules-block heading="Secret Objectives" %}}

At the start of the game, deal all players one **Secret Objective** tile.

It gives each player a unique, specific rule about what scores them more or fewer points this game.
