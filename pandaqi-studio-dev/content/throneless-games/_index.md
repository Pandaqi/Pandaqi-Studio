A series of games about secretly collecting the most votes, as the players constantly change seats to get to the elusive throne.

This is the **overview page** of the Throneless Games.

Click any of the links below to visit a specific game. They are sorted based on simplicity.

* [Smallseat](/throneless-games/conquer/smallseat/) => the most simplified and streamlined version, with a visual style more attractive to kids.
* [Queenseat](/throneless-games/conquer/queenseat/) => the best introduction for all ages, using a changing Throne card to keep the game simple but tactical.
* [Kingseat](/throneless-games/conquer/kingseat/) => the original version, with slightly more complicated setup and Princes.
* [Kaizerseat](/throneless-games/conquer/kaizerseat/) => the most complicated version, giving you the deepest gameplay in return.
  
These games all have the same core mechanic (the "Throneless Mechanic"): you simultaneously vote every turn, and either your vote is registered, or it's discarded and you swap places with someone.

They also have the same fonts and visual style, though the specific images are different.

Why? Because on top of this, each game includes different mechanics and a different set of "Princes" to root for. Each Prince is based on a different animal, and has a different ability or winning condition.

This game actually uses three different fonts. (These are called "blackletter" or "fraktur" fonts.)

* Moderne Fraktur
* UniFraktur Cook (Bold)
* Gothic Ultra OT

Generally, you don't want to do that. (Two different font families at most!) But I just couldn't find a single font of which I liked all the letters, in all situations, and it was always readable. These fit together nicely and still kept text easy to read. 

Though you can choose, in the settings, if you prefer legibility or a more stylish fonts. That's another major benefit of a website that _generates_ board game material for you on the fly!

All other assets and code is mine. The main emblem (or "coat of arms") for each pack was generated using image AI, although with a lot of manual work before and after. (For example, the AI doesn't seem to understand that most animals have 4 legs, not 5.)

This game started as a "queueing game". I wanted to design games you could play in a queue or waiting room. This meant they had to be very simple, but allow many different group sizes. They had to be playable without table, chairs, or much space at all. 

Kingseat was the first game to come out of this journey. It's not the best, as it still requires people to stand in a circle and hold quite some cards. It still turned out a very good game in its own right. The other versions quickly followed, taking the idea in different directions or for different audiences.

In the end, I decided to rename these "queuing games" to [Waitless Games](/waitless-games/) instead. And I decided to _not_ include this project, as it was just too impractical to actually play in a queue. Click the link to visit the official page for Waitless Games, which has a growing number of games you _can_ play while waiting somewhere.
