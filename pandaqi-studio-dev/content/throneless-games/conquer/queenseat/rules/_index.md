Pick as many Princesses as the number of players. Add all of them to the deck, shuffle, and deal fairly.

Pick any player: their position is the **Queenseat** (and whoever sits there is called the **Queen**).

Card facing is important in this game. From now on, hand cards that face towards yourself are called **secret cards**. Cards that face away (to the _other players_) are **public cards**.

You CAN include more animals; this makes the game longer and harder.

The game ends once **nobody can Vote anymore**. Whoever **is the Queen** when that happens, **wins**!

Gameplay happens in rounds.

Each round,
* All players pick a **secret card** from their Hand: their Vote.
* Once done, reveal these votes simultaneously.
* The Princess with the **most votes** wins.
* **Tied?** The one closest to Queenseat, going clockwise, wins.

The Queen gets 1 card of choice (as a **public** card). All winning voters may pick who receives their card, which can be themselves (**public**).

{{< rules-image src="gameplay_1.webp" alt="Example of voting in a round, then checking who won and handling their cards." >}}

For each remaining card, the player must make a choice. (Handle this from the Queenseat again, in clockwise order, until all cards are gone.)

* Either execute the **action** on the card.
* Or **swap places** with another player.

The Queen decides who receives your card (**public**), but they can't pick themselves.

Remember that Queenseat is a **position**. Whoever sits there, is currently Queen. As such, when they swap places, they do not remain Queen.

There are, however, two wrinkles.

* You are **not** allowed to vote the type you see the **most** in your neighbor's hands. (Unless you have no choice.)
* You may only **swap places with the Queen** if they have **fewer** public cards of the **winning type** than you.

That's it! Have fun!

Below is an overview of all different Princesses in the game. It's roughly sorted based on how difficult the card's actions are to understand.

It's recommended to **not** include two Animals of **similar color** in the same game. They have similar actions and might make the game monotone.

The cards **explain themselves**, but the overview below contains clarifications or extra details.

Whenever you **receive cards** for an action, you may _choose_ whether to make them public or secret. (Unless the action explicitly states what to do, of course.)
