Check out the main overview page for [Throneless Games](/throneless-games/) for more detailed credits and background.

As stated on that page, this was the very first entry in the Throneless Games! It was also one of the very first games that could be _generated_ right on this website. Because it was my first attempt, I knew it had mistakes and possible improvements, which is why I immediately planned to return a year later to "finish" the Throneless Games.

I'm glad I did, because simply returning with 1 more year of game development experience changed the entire game for the better. (Though that single year did contain the creation of 30+ games, so some improvement was to be expected :p)

The original version was fine, but lacked simple professional polish on the card design and game core. The second version feels like one of my simplest games that still has a lot of depth. (Even though it sailed past its original objective of being a [Waitless Game](/waitless-games/), meaning you really have to play Kingseat at a table with chairs, otherwise it's just impractical.)
