Pick as many unique animals as the number of players. Add all their cards to the deck, then shuffle.

{{% remark %}}
You can use more animals, but know it makes the game longer and more difficult. 
{{% /remark %}}

Pick a player: they become the **Teller**. 

* Their position ( = where they sit/stand) is called the **Smallseat**.
* They publicly call out **one animal** before the game starts. 
* They start _without cards_, but will receive more and more as the game progresses.

All other players are **Candidates**. Deal the deck to the candidates until empty, as fairly as possible. Any remaining cards go to the Teller.

Optionally, for the brave,

* You can include more animals. This makes the game longer and deeper.
* You include animals from other Throneless Games. They are, however, more complicated and less suitable.

The game ends once **no Candidate can vote anymore**.

Count the cards in the Teller's hand that face _them_. The animal that appears **most often** wins. (This can be multiple animals.)

* If this was the animal that the Teller called out at the start, they win _alone_!
* Otherwise, each player whose _final card_ is the same as the _winning animal_, wins!

Gameplay happens in rounds, but each round is played _simultaneously_. Whoever is in the Smallseat position at the start of a round is called the **Boss**.

Each round,

* Everybody who has **more than 1 card** in their Hand, picks a secret card.
* When done, reveal all.
* From the Smallseat position, clockwise, check the votes.
* Find the **first longest sequence** of votes for the same animal: they win the round!

All votes for this animal go into the **Teller's hand**, facing _them_ ("secret cards").

In clockwise order, for each remaining card, the player gets a choice. 

* Either **execute** the action on it.
* Or **swap places** with another player.

Whatever happens, the card goes into the **Teller's hand**, facing _away_ to other players ("public cards").

Yes, the Teller simply plays with the cards they are given. If they play a public card, however, they must do so _before_ anybody else picks their vote.

That's it!

Below is an overview of all different Animals in the game. It's roughly sorted based on how difficult the card's actions are to understand.

It's recommended to **not** include two Animals of **similar color** in the same game. They have similar actions and might make the game monotone.

The cards **explain themselves**, but the overview below contains clarifications or extra details.
