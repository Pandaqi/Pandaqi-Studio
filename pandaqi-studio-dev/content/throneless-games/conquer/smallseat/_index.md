{{% boardgame-intro heading="" %}}

A [Throneless Game](/throneless-games/) about helping your Animal win the throne, aimed more at kids.

{{% /boardgame-intro %}}

{{% section-centered heading="What do I need?" %}}

Three simple steps.
* Read the short [playful rules](rules).
* Download the base game PDF. (Download > Files > Base Game.)
* Print, cut, play!

**Want more?** You can also [generate your own material](#material) right on this website, to suit your specific needs.

The cards contain text. However, this text is simple and consistent ( = the same for each card of that animal), so you can explain them beforehand if some players can't read (English).

Check out the main overview page for [Throneless Games](/throneless-games/) for more detailed credits and background.

After making the first game ([Kingseat](/throneless-games/conquer/kingseat)), I saw that the idea could really go in two directions. It could be simplified even further, or it could receive a few more mechanics to make it a deeper strategical game. (Kingseat kind of hovered between the two, which is why it's a mid-game of the project.)

Smallseat was that simplest version. I tried, in every possible way, to minimize rules and requirements (material needed, space needed, etcetera). 

So what's different in this version?

* There is no Discard or Vote pile (for which you would need a table or similar). Instead, one _player_ holds the votes cast in their hand, while also playing themselves.
* Animals have fewer cards that always have the exact same action. (No Dark Actions, no variation, shorter games, easier to remember.)
* Both of these things simplify setup and gameplay even more, at the slight cost of the action text usually requiring a few more words.
* The graphic design is cuter and more aimed at kids.
