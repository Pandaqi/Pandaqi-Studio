{{% section-centered heading="Unbearable Games" %}}

Welcome to the Unbearable Games! Where the rules change every second and bears are sure to ruin everything.

On your turn, you try to play a set of animals that beats the previous one.

And as we all know, there are two ways to win any sport.

* You play better than your opponent ( = higher numbers)
* You change the rules ( = different most occurring animal)

If you can't or don't want to, you must give away cards.

But bears ... have several special powers that can either hand you victory or destroy all your plans.

It's your goal to win _so hard_ that nobody can do the two things above. Have fun!
