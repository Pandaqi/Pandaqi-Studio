The fonts used are **Sancreek** (headings) and **Sedan** (body text). Everything else is mine.

**This game can be played with a standard deck of cards.** If you do, you only need to download and print the **Bidding Cards** set. Select the cards 1--10 from your standard deck and decide which suit maps to which (bird) suit in this game. And you're good to go!

This idea is a kind of "twin" of [Bidding Blocks](/bidding-blocks/). Visit that page for a bit more backstory and credits.

Yes, the title is a homage to the book _Six of Crows_, if you've read it. The game has absolutely nothing to do with that book or fantasy world, but I just really like the sound of the title.
