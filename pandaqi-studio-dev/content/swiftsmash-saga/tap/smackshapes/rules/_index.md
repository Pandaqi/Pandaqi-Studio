Deal everyone 3 cards. Pick anyone to be _Smackhead_ ( = start player).

The game ends as soon as everyone is **out of (hand) cards**. The number of cards you won is your score: **highest score wins!**

Gameplay happens in _rounds_. There are no turns: everyone plays _at the same time_.

* All players pick a secret card from their hand.
* Once done, reveal all cards simultaneously.

Now everyone quickly studies what has been played and **taps a card**. Once you tapped something, you can't change anymore.

> The _first_ player to tap the _winning card_, wins this round.

How do you find the "winning card"?

* Every card has a **shape ranking** at the top. The one on the _Smackhead_'s card is true for this round.
* The winning card is the one with the **earliest shape** in that ranking.
* If multiple cards have that shape, the one with the **highest number of them** wins.

The winning player collects all cards played and places them facedown in their "score pile". They become the new _Smackhead_.

You probably noticed that cards have _colors_ too. These become important now.

Firstly, this expansion adds a **new rule**.

> If all cards in the round have the same color, the round "inverts": you must tap the _last shape_ in the ranking, and the _lowest number_ of it.

Secondly, this expansion adds **special cards**. They have a written action on them that is true for this round.

This can lead to _multiple winning cards_. This is fine! Every player who was the _first_ to tap a winning card, is a winner that round. Distribute the cards fairly over all winners, discard any leftovers.

It can also lead to _no winning cards_. In that case, you win if you're the first to slap empty space in the center of the table and yell: "Nothing to smack!"
