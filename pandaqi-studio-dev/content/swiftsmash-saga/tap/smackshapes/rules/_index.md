Deal everyone X cards. Pick anyone to be _Smackhead_ ( = start player).

The game ends as soon as everyone is **out of (hand) cards**. The number of cards you won is your score: **highest score wins!**

{{% rules-block heading="Gameplay" icon="action" %}}

Gameplay happens in _rounds_. There are no turns: everyone plays _at the same time_.

* Everyone picks a secret card from their hand and places it in front of them.
* Once done, everyone reveals their cards at the same time.

Now everyone must quickly study what has been played and **tap a card**. Once you tapped something, you can't change anymore.

> The _first_ player to tap the _winning card_, wins this round.

How do you find the "winning card"?

* Every card has a _ranking_ for shapes at the top (such as SQUARE > TRIANGLE > CIRCLE). The ranking on the card played by the Smackhead is true for this round.
* The winning card is the one with the **earliest shape** in that ranking.
* If multiple cards have that shape, the winning card is the one with the **higher number of them**.

The winner of the round collects all cards played and places them facedown in their "score pile". They become the new Smackhead.

You probably noticed that cards have _colors_ too. These become important now.

Firstly, this expansion adds a **new rule**.

> If all cards in the round have the same color, the round "inverts": you must tap the _last shape_ in the ranking, and the _lowest number_ of it.

Secondly, this expansion adds **special cards**. They have a written action on them that is true for this round. (Example: "Ignore any Blue cards" or "Add +1 to the number of every Red card" or "If you tap a non-winning card, you lose 1 of your cards won as penalty.")

This can lead to _multiple winning cards_. This is fine! Every player who was the _first_ to tap a winning card, is a winner that round. Distribute the cards fairly over all winners, discard any leftovers.

It can also lead to _no winning cards_. In that case, you win if you're the first to yell: "Nothing to smack!"
