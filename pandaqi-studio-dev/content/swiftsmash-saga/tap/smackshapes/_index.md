The fonts used are **Mouse Memoirs** (headings) and **Manuscript** (body text). Everything else is mine.

A few years ago now, I made _Cookie Smasher_. My first attempt at creating a very simple and fast party game about "smashing the right card". It was a good attempt, and the final game looks good and plays well. 

But as it always happens, your first attempt at something is a bit "middle of the road" in terms of difficulty and fun factor. By making it, you learn how to make a _simpler_ version next time.

Well, this game _is_ that simpler version! I took all the lessons from Cookie Smasher and distilled the "swiftsmash experience" into this very simple game. A game without text on the cards---just shapes and colors---making it playable for all age groups and backgrounds.

And with the creation of this game, I finally had _multiple games_ with this mechanic and could call it a series: the SwiftSmash Saga.
