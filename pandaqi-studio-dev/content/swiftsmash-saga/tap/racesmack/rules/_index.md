Deal everyone X cards.

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

During the game, you'll win cards and place them in a row before you. This is called your **Race**. 

Every Race needs a single Rules Card. Once you've satisfied its **Finish Requirements**, you win the game.

{{% rules-block heading="Gameplay" icon="action" %}}

Gameplay happens in **rounds**. There are no turns: everyone plays _at the same time_.

* Everyone picks a secret card from their hand and places it in front of them.
* Once done, everyone reveals their cards at the same time.

Now everyone quickly studies the cards played and then **taps a card**. Each card can only be tapped by one player.

Only some cards, however, are correct. By default,

> A card is **correct** if it contains the **symbol that appears most often** (across all cards).

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

Once everyone has tapped something, the round ends.

* If **correct**, you win your own card. Place it in your _Race_ (left or right end). A race can only contain a single Rules Card, but you can always replace it with later cards if you want.
* If **incorrect**, you lose 1 of your Race cards.

Any remaining cards are won by the _first player_ that tapped a _correct card_ (the "fastest winner").

But there's one final twist. The Rules Cards can change everything.

* **No Rules Cards played?** You simply use the default rules of the game for checking if a card is "correct".
* **One Rules Card Played?** That rule determines the "correct" cards instead.
* **Multiple Rules Cards Played?** They all cancel each other; pretend none have been played.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansions & Variants" id="expansions" icon="expansion" %}}

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

This game has many different variants that require _no extra material_. This makes it very easy to try a few of them and see if you like the change.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Racing Rules" %}}

This variant simply changes the _default rule_ for each round.

* Keep 10 random Rules Cards in a separate deck.
* At the start of each round, reveal the top one. That's now the "default rule" for finding correct cards.
* Once this deck is empty, simply re-use the same 10 cards again for a new deck.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Time Penalty" %}}

Use this variant if you find players are just tapping randomly and without concern for being incorrect.

When tapping an incorrect card, you must pick one of the following penalties.

* Lose **2 race cards**.
* Lose **2 hand cards**.
* Next round, you are always "incorrect" if there's a tie ( = there are _multiple_ correct cards).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Noise Canceling" %}}

The following rule makes the game considerably harder, but creates more variety in what cards are correct.

* Notice that every Rules Card has a unique number.
* When multiple of them are played (in the same round), the _highest number_ is the rule you must follow.
* (Instead of multiple Rules Cards _canceling_ each other.)

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Tiebreaker" %}}

This variant creates only a **single** correct card in most rounds.

* Whenever there are multiple correct cards,
* Ties are broken by the card showing the **color that appears most often** (among the tied cards).
* If still a tie, the **highest number of symbols** on the card wins.

For example,

* 3 cards are played: 2 Square (G), 1 Square (G), 1 Square (Y) + 2 Circle (B)
* The most common icon is Square, so all cards are correct.
* The color that appears most often is G (Green), so only card 1-2 remains
* The highest number of symbols is 2, so card 1 wins.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: After You" %}}

This variant makes the game **turn-based** instead of simultaneous.

* Pick any start player.
* Player's hands are "blind": a facedown pile before them.
* From start player, in clockwise turns, people reveal a _single_ card (faceup).
* Only once somebody reveals a Rules Card, the smashing begins.
  * That specific card tells you the rule for what's "correct".
  * If you're correct, you win the entire _pile_ of cards that has built up in front of you.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Shifting Gears" %}}

All the cards in the game have three properties: their shapes, their colors, and how many of them.

In the base game, cards show this by simply displaying the icons as many times as needed. 

In this expansion, however, cards will have **different ways of displaying the "how many" part**.

* NUMBER = An actual number + times symbol
* HAND = The number is shown by counting how many fingers the hand holds up
* DICE = The number is shown by a die face.
* ROMAN = The number is shown by roman numerals (or rather "tallying")

<!--- 
DEPRECATED:
* COPY = "I am whatever the neighbor is at which I point" => this is just a weird exception now to the otherwise consistent structure. It can also lead to a confusing loop when _all_ cards copy and there is thus no value to any of them. It's messy, it's meh, just left it out.
* INVERT = Show some numbers/symbols but CROSSED OUT. The card is _all the things it didn't cross out_ => this doesn't really work because the core rules of the game stop working if a card can be "multiple things at once".
