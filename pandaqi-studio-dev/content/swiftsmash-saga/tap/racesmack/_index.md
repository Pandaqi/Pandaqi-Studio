The fonts used are **New Amsterdam** (headings) and **Whackadoo** (body text). Yes, that second font was chosen purely because the name ("whack") fits the SwiftSmash saga. I am a professional designer, thank you very much. Everything else is mine.

@TODO: NOTE TO SELF, this page only exists already because I wanted to store the fonts somewhere; this will not get made until the next update for SwiftSmash Saga.
