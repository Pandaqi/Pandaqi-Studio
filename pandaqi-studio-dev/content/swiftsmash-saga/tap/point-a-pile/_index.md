The fonts used are **Aunt Bertha** (headings) and **Amaranth** (body text). Everything else is mine.

The original idea came after I discovered _Let's Hit Each Other With Fake Swords_ by the Exploding Kittens designers. If you know me, then you know my brain immediately went: "Oh, we can use that one clever thing it does and create an entirely different game from it!"

In this case, that game asks players to grab cards and then divide them into piles. Then, simultaneously, everyone must point at the pile they want. In _that_ game, if multiple players want the same pile, you have to fight it out with fake swords. (As the name implies. Over the years I've come to realize just how useful it is to give projects a long name that clearly communicates exactly what the project is about :p)

Though I can enjoy a game like that and have fun, I don't ... love such gimmicky aspects with plastic components. And I know not everyone is comfortable with that and the fun can quickly wear off. So I took the same idea, but made it a more "traditional" board game.

In my game, you're still pointing at piles of cards that you want (at the same time). But if you have a conflict, you simply _repeat the process_: split the pile again and do the pointing again. 

Besides that, this game is completely different from its inspiration. It's even simpler in terms of rules and setup, yet has a bit more depth and strategy. Exactly what I set out to do!
