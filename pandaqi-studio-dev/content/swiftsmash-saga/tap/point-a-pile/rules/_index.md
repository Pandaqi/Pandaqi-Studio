{{% rules-block heading="Setup" icon="setup" %}}

Turn all cards into a single deck, shuffle, and place facedown on the table. Pick any player to be start player.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

The game ends as soon as a player has **5 cards of the same color** or **5 points**. They win!

First, the active player **creates piles**.

* They draw twice as many cards as the number of players from the deck. 
* They distribute them into _at most_ as many piles as the number of players.

Then, everyone **picks what they want**.

* Everyone raises their finger (to point at the ceiling)
* The active player counts down (_3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Point!_)
* Everyone simultaneously points at/taps one of the piles on the table. You may also tap _empty space_ on purpose.

Finally, resolve **who gets what**.

* If nobody wanted a certain pile, discard it.
* If only a single player wanted a pile, they **score those cards**. (Keep a faceup score pile in front of you.)
* Otherwise, if multiple players point to a pile, split the pile and repeat the process.
  * Split the pile into smaller piles -> Active Player counts down.
  * Only those players (who all wanted the original pile) point at what they want -> Resolve
  * If the pile can't be split any further ( = it's 1 card), discard the pile.

If only a _single_ player tapped empty space this round, they get all piles that would otherwise be discarded.

Finally, in the base game, there's one restriction on which piles you may pick: you **can't** pick a pile that shows the **same color** as (the top card of) your score pile.

Start player moves clockwise from the active player. Play the next round!

_Remark: It is, of course, important that players really point at the same time and don't (sneakily or not) change their mind later. It's supposed to be a silly little party game with snapshot simultaneous decisions. Don't play with cheaters!_

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

This game has no official variants.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Complete-a-Mission" %}}

This expansion adds new material: **Mission Cards**.

During setup, everyone draws a secret **Mission**. This card tells you exactly when you win. ("You need 5 cards of the same color", "You need at least 10 points", etcetera)

The game ends when a player reveals they've won (according to their personal mission).

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Dont-a-Touchme" %}}

This expansion adds special cards with a rule about **who may (not) tap them**.

These rules are only in effect if that card is at the _top_ of its pile ( = it's visible/readable).
