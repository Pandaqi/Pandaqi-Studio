Deal everyone X cards to take into their hand.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

The game ends when everyone is **out of (hand) cards**. Every card in your _Library_ is worth 1 point. **Highest score wins!**

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Gameplay" icon="action" %}}

Gameplay happens in _rounds_. There are no turns: everyone plays _at the same time_.

* Everyone picks a secret card from their hand and places it in front of them.
* Once done, everyone reveals their cards at the same time.

The first player to **tap the highest letter (in order of the alphabet)** wins the round!

But there are two twists.

* If a letter appears **twice** (uppercase and lowercase), you must tap the **uppercase** version.
* If the cards (when read in order) happen to **spell a word, don't tap any card**. Instead, tap empty space and say the word out loud to win.

The winner of a round wins all the cards. Place them in your _Library_, which is just a facedown pile in front of you on the table.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Turn-Based Play" %}}

The default version of _Booksmack_ is a fast and loose (party) game. Try this variant instead if you want to play it more slowly and tactically, not relying on quick thinking or reaction time.

Below are the changes for this variant.

**Objective**: the game ends as soon as a single player is out of cards. 

* Your final score is equal to your Library _plus_ the cards left in your hand.
* All special cards (from expansions) score 1 point, as usual.
* Every letter, however, scores its _position in the alphabet_ divided by 5 (and rounded down).
* If you own both the uppercase and lowercase version of a letter, they are worth 2 extra points each.

**Gameplay**:

* You play **in turns**. The cards you play are still placed in a circle, not a single pile (as often happens in card games).
* On your turn, you play a card from your hand, and place it in front of you. (Covering your previous card, if it's still there.)
* If it's currently the "highest card" (the one you should "tap"), draw a card from the deck.
* If it's currently the "lowest card", steal a card from another player. (Either blindly from their hand, or the latest card they played in front of them.)
* If you spell a word, you win all cards played: they go into your Library.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Power Punctuation" %}}

This expansion adds **punctuation cards**.

* The **period** (`.`) divides the cards into groups, like creating sentences. You only have to tap the highest letter _within its group_ to win.
* The **question mark** (`?`) is a wildcard for spelling words. It is any letter you need to spell an existing word. Otherwise, it's considered "not a letter" and should never be tapped.
* The **exclamation mark** (`!`) is a bailout: it there are more exclamation marks than regular letters, you must tap them.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Nifty Numbers" %}}

This expansion adds **number cards** (0--25).

To win a round, you must still tap the "highest number". But now you'll have to convert letters to numbers, or numbers to letters, to find out which one comes _later_ in the alphabet.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Giggling Glyphs" %}}

This expansion adds more **uncommon glyps and symbols**.

* The **plus** (`+`): it becomes the same letter as its highest neighbor, but 1 higher.
* The **min** (`-`): it becomes the same letter as its lowest neighbor, but 1 lower.
* The **space** (` `): this card should be ignored. (That is, it's allowed to be "inside" a word without ruining it. It should never be tapped and otherwise has no influence on the round.)
* The **ampersand** (`&`): connects the two letters around it. Their "number" (or "place in the alphabet") is equal to the _sum_ of both their numbers.
* The **asterisk** (`*`): ??
* The **at** (`@`): if next to the highest number of the round, you must tap this card instead.
* The **tilde** (`~`): you're allowed to tap ANY card (except this one) to win the round.
* The **pound** (`#`): you must tap the LOWEST card instead to win the round.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Cursed Critics" %}}

This expansion adds **letters with diacritics**, more commonly known as "accents". (umlaute and stuff).

* A letter with a diacritic is always considered "higher" than the same letter without it.
* A letter with a diacritic can't be used for spelling words.

If a letter appears multiple times with a diacritic, tapping any of them will win the round. This means, in rare occassions, there can be a _tie_ and _multiple winners_. (If people slammed different winning cards at roughly the same time.)

In that case, simply distribute the winning cards over the winners as fairly as possible, discarding any leftovers.
