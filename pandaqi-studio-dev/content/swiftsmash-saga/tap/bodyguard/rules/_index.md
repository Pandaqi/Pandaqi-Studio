## Setup

{{< rules/rules-image-sidebar src="test-image.webp" >}}

Create a deck of cards, but keep the _Emperor_ separate. Shuffle and deal until empty. (It's fine if some players have one more card than others.)

It's important to sit and play cards roughly in a circle.

The youngest player becomes the Guardian.

Cards come in three flavors: monsters, shields and bystanders. You can assemble your own custom deck, as long as you make sure they are roughly in the proportions 50% / 25% / 25%.

## Objective

The game ends as soon as a player is **out of cards**. Whoever **has the most cards** wins!

## Gameplay

Turns happen simultaneously.

* All players pick one card from their hand. (With <4 players, pick two.) 
* Everyone places their card face-down before them.
* The Guardian swaps _one_ card for the Emperor (which you kept to the side).
* Reveal all cards (at the same time).

Now all players look for the same thing. (Explained in more detail in the [next section](#attacking).)

> Is there **a card** that would **change** the Emperor's fate if **removed**?

In other words,

* Is the Emperor currently safe? Find a card that would put them in danger if removed.
* Is the Emperor currently under attack? Find a card that would make them safe if removed.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE (reveal + search the rule + handle scoring)

Be the first to find this card and smash it to win! If there is **no such card**, smash the Emperor.

As soon as somebody smashed a card, the round is over. 

* They were right? They add one of the cards played into their hand. Discard the rest.
* They were wrong? They remove 3 cards from their hand (as penalty). All cards played are discarded.

Whatever the case, this player becomes the new Guardian.

{{% rules/rules-remark %}}
Never discard the Emperor. Keep it to the side for next round.

### Attacking

Each card shows somebody **facing right**. By revealing the card upside down, you can make them face **left**.

How do you check what happens in a round?

* Evaluate the cards played, starting with the **Emperor** and moving in the **direction they face**.
* If a card shows an action, simply execute it.
* Monsters will automatically **attack** in the direction they face. 

What is an attack?

* The monster _hits_ the first card they encounter.
* If a card can't be hit, check the _next_ one. Continue doing so until the attack hits something or has made a full circle.
* When a card is hit, it's **eliminated**. Pretend it doesn't exist anymore from now on.

**Bystanders can't be hit**. Other cards can only avoid being hit through special powers.
