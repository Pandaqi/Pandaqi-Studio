Pick any tile with the **ADD action**. Place it faceup in the center of the table; this will be the starting tile of the waterfall.

Deal all players **4 tiles** and **1 Pawn**. The remaining tiles become the facedown draw pile.

The game **ends** when the waterfall **contains 20(+) cards** or the **deck is empty** (rare). 

Sum the points on your scored tiles. **Highest score wins!**

From start player, take clockwise turns until the game ends.

On your turn, place your pawn at the top of the waterfall and **fall down!**

For every tile you pass on your way,
* Execute its action (if it has one).
* Then pick your next tile. (Follow one of its water paths _downward_).
* You **can't** enter an occupied tile ( = it contains another pawn).

EXCEPTION: You may share a tile if, otherwise, _all possible waterfall paths_ would be blocked.

Your turn **ends** once you **exit the waterfall** or **get stuck**. If so, leave your pawn where it is until your next turn.

Everything in this game happens by executing a tile's action (when you fall through it). 

The main actions are ADD, DRAW and SCORE. Others are explained on the tile itself.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE

When you do an **ADD** action,
* Place a tile from your hand in the waterfall. 
* It must be _next_ to an existing tile
* It must _not_ overlap an existing tile.
* All its **water paths** must match neighbors.

The **DRAW** action allows drawing 2 cards from the top of the facedown deck, into your hand.

The **SCORE** action works as follows.
* Check the _gemstones_ that are on this tile.
* Pick **1 hand tile** with a _matching gemstone_.
* Place this tile facedown in your score pile. Its point value (the golden star) score at the end of the game.
* If you have no matching tile (or don't want to score it), this does nothing.

That's it! Have fun!

Want to modify the game to make it less or more challenging? Try these variants and expansions.

Try any of these rule changes for an **easier** game.

* The (score) number on a card states how many Pawns are allowed to be on it. (Example: a 2-card allows 2 pawns at once.)
* Use only the tiles with basic actions (ADD, DRAW, SCORE; the ones that have an icon) and play until deck is empty.
* Ignore the water paths when moving: you're allowed to move to any of the two tiles below your current one. (The paths must still match when _placing_ a new tile.)
* Instead of resetting to the top each time, simply continue your turn where you left off.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Droplets with Demands" %}}

This expansion adds "gated tiles". These have a requirement (or "gate") on them, and you're only allowed to enter the tile _if you meet the requirements_. 

This is usually based on your path so far this turn. This makes the game harder to play and to win.
