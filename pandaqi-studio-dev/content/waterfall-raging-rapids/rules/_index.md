Pick one of the **starter tiles** (marked with X) and place it faceup in the center of the table.

Deal all players **X tiles** and **1 Pawn**. The remaining tiles become the facedown draw pile.

The game **ends** when when the waterfall **contains 20(+) cards**.

From start player, take clockwise turns until the game ends.

On your turn, place your pawn at the top of the waterfall and **fall down!**

For every tile you pass on your way,
* Execute its action (if it has one)
* Then pick your next tile by following one of its paths that move _downward_.
* You **can't** enter a tile that contains another player. You may only share a tile if, otherwise, getting stuck would block _all possible paths_ through the waterfall.

Your turn ends once you exit the waterfall or can't move further. (If you get stuck, leave your pawn where it is until your next turn.)

Everything in this game happens by executing a tile's action (when you fall through it). 

The main actions are ADD, DRAW and SCORE. Others are explained on the tile itself.

When you do an **ADD** action,
* Place a tile from your hand in the waterfall. 
* It must be adjacent to an existing tile, and not overlap anything.
* All the **water paths** must match.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE

The **DRAW** action allows drawing cards from the top of the facedown deck, into your hand.

The **SCORE** action works as follows.
* Check the _gemstones_ that are on this tile.
* Pick a **tile from your hand** that has a _matching gemstone_.
* Place that tile facedown in your score pile. It's point value (the golden star) scores at the end of the game.
* If you have no matching tile (or don't want to score it), this does nothing.

That's it! Have fun!

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! Try any of the expansions below.

{{% rules-block heading="Droplets with Demands" %}}

This expansion adds tiles with a "condition" on them. Based on your path so far, this limits if you're allowed to visit the tile.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Crowdy Currents" %}}

This expansion adds tiles that allow multiple players on them and/or provide special actions related to pawns. This mostly changes _how_ to execute the action based on the surroundings or the path taken thus far.
