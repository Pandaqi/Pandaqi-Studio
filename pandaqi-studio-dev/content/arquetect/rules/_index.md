Assemble your deck of cards. The more you put in, the longer the game takes. It's recommended to have a nice variety of building categories (some residential, some industry, etcetera).

A good deck for a first game is @TODO

Now deal the deck until empty. Crucially, you may **never change the order of cards in your hand**. (Receive your cards however they come and don't accidentally change or rearrange.)

The game ends when all players are "done" (explained below). Calculate your score: from left to right, sum how much each card scores. The player with the highest scoring city wins!

Take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, take **one** of two actions.

* **Gift**: insert one card from your hand anywhere into another player's hand
* **Trade**: offer 1--3 cards to another player. If they decline, move to the next player. If they accept, they offer 1--3 cards in return. If both players are happy with the deal, trade cards.

When trading, simply say the _names_ of the cards. Don't take them out of your hand (even temporarily), as that is likely to mess with the right order.

The counteroffer can be anything. You _don't_ have to match the number of cards of the original offer.

Cards received from a trade can be put into your hand at any position.

@TODO: EXAMPLE (show somebody inserting their fire into another's hand, then somebody proposing a deal and going through with it)

@TODO: Is an interactive example necessary? What would it do exactly?

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

At the end of your turn, if you're satisfied with your city, you can say you're "done". Un-spread your hand to signal this. Players who are done are out of the game (you can't steal, gift or trade cards with them).

The game ends when no (or only one) player remains.

Arquetect has one optional expansion! It includes many new buildings, but also event cards with an **ability**.

This adds one more **action** you can possibly take on your turn.

> Execute the ability of a card. After doing so, rotate the card to face away from you, as a reminder you cannot take this action again.

If such a card changes hands, the receiver can just rotate it towards themselves (and thus take the action again).

The game also immediately **ends** when any player has **4 (or more) outward facing cards**.
