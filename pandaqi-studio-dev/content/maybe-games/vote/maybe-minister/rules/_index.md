Create a deck of **Votes**. 

Each player receives a **Support** card of value 1 (green side up). Place it in front of you with 2 Votes on top of it.

Finally, deal all players **5 Cards** to take into their hand.

The game ends once all players are out of cards. 

The **laws** you enact in-game give you the scoring rules over time. (Example: "Gold is worth 2 points".)

The game ends when a player has accrued **25 points (or more)**. They win!

From start player, take clockwise turns. Each turn has three simple phases: _propose_, _vote_ and _collect_.

@TODO: INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE (does that make sense?)

{{% rules-block heading="Propose" %}}

On your turn, **make a proposal**.
* Place 1--5 cards from your hand faceup on the table.
* Refill your hand to 5.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (is that even needed??)

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Vote" %}}

Everyone **votes** on this proposal.
* From your possible votes---all Votes on cards you've won---secretly pick the one you want.
* Once done, everyone simultaneously reveals their vote.
* If the majority voted YES, the proposal is ACCEPTED. Otherwise, it's REJECTED.

If ACCEPTED, all LAW cards become permanent rules in the game. Otherwise, discard them.

Finally, sort all the voters from LOW to HIGH. 
* In that order, everyone takes one card from the proposal. (Cycle until all cards taken.)
* If ACCEPTED, place that card before you with the green side up. Otherwise, place it red side up.

On cards you've won, only the side pointing up ( = away from you) is the one that's true.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Collect" %}}

Everyone collects **new votes**. 
* Sum the numbers on your SUPPORT cards. If above 0, draw that number of votes.
* You _may_ discard any other RESOURCE card you own to get +1 vote.

You must store these votes on cards you've won. Each card, however, can only store a limited amount. You can't draw more than you can store.

@TODO?

{{% rules-block heading="Abstain" %}}

This expansion adds **Abstain** votes and **Law** cards that modify them.

When a player uses this vote, it simply doesn't count. Pretend it's not there. The player does not collect a card or influence voting in any way.

This basic rule, of course, can change when certain Laws are passed.
