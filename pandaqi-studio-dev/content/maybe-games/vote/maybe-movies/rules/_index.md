Create a deck of **Votes**: 5 YES and 5 NO per player. Shuffle and deal 10 secret Votes to each player. Place any remaining votes in a faceup draw pool.

Create a deck of **Movie Cards**. Place 6 of them faceup next to the deck: the market.

The game ends when **all players are out of Votes**.

During the game, you build a row of **Movies Made**. Each Vote Card you've **won** (not in hand) is worth the number of times its icon appears on these Movies Made. The **highest score wins**!

From start player, take clockwise turns.

On your turn, **pitch a movie idea!**
* Chain cards from the market into a row in the center of the table.
* You must use at least 1 card.
* (Refill the market as needed.)

The sum of the numbers in orange (top) is called the **Budget** of the movie. 

The sum of the numbers in green (bottom) is called the **Profit** of the movie.

Once done, everyone **votes simultaneously**.
* Pick a secret Vote from your hand.
* One everyone has done so, reveal simultaneously.
* Sum the votes: every YES has its value added, every NO has its value subtracted.
* If the votes match the **Budget** (at least), your pitch SUCCEEDS! (The movie is greenlit!)
* Otherwise, your pitch FAILS.

Example: The votes were YES-3, YES-5 and NO-2. Their sum is thus 3 + 5 - 2 = 6. The budget for the movie was 5. The pitch SUCCEEDS!

If the movie succeeds,
* Grab as many Votes as the **Profit**. Use the votes from this round first, then fill up the remaining space from draw pool. <!--- @TODO: Change this rule to "you must fill up the remaining space with Votes that are all the same icon, if possible"?? --->
* Shuffle and fairly distribute among all YES-voters. 
* Any leftover Votes---which couldn't be shared fairly---go to the active player.
* These Votes are **won**. Place them in front of you, don't take them into your hand.
* Place 2 cards from this movie in the row of Movies Made. <!--- @TODO: 1 card might be fine too here?? --->

If the movie fails, all NO-voters _win_ their own vote. If _everyone_ voted NO, however, then nobody gets anything back.

Any remaining Movie Cards are discarded.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or feel like your group needs some tweaks to the game? Check out these expansions.

{{% rules-block heading="Trendsetter Tricks" %}}

This expansion _expands_ on the idea of market demands and tracking Movies Made. We now track if a movie failed or not, and new pitches with matching properties change based on that.

During **gameplay**, the following rule is added.

For each symbol that matches a Previous Movie,
* If that movie failed, the **Cost** of that card doubles.
* If that movie succeeded, the **Profit** of that card doubles.

At the **end of the round**, the following rule replaces the "save 2 cards from a successful movie" rule. 

* Turn the movie into one stack of cards with any card on top. 
* If success, place the green side up, otherwise orange side. 
* Place this stack into the row of Movies Made.

{{% rules-block heading="Breaking Changes" %}}

During **setup**, 
* Also include 2 CHANGE tokens per player.
* And place 2 faceup Movie Cards before each player.

After **voting**, first resolve all CHANGE votes.
* Sort those players by number on the vote (low to high; CHANGE numbers are unique)
* Each of them must now _change_ the pitch by adding one of their own Movie Cards and/or removing an existing Movie Card.
* (Refill your personal Movie Cards as needed.)
* Once done, everyone takes back their vote _except_ the CHANGE-voters, and you simply vote again on the new pitched Movie.

Optionally, players may improvise a pitch for why their change is amazing and makes the movie waaaay better.

{{% rules-block heading="Blockbuster Budgets" %}}

This expansion includes **Movie Cards** that don't use icons, but display text for the _cost_ and _profit_. This means the value of pitches, and how they can succeed, receives a lot more variation.

Clarifications:
* Some texts depend on order. In that case, read the cards from the pitch from left to right, from the perspective of the active player.
* Some texts might create a tie or multiple options. In that case, the active player picks which one it is.

As always,
* The top (orange) part shows the _cost_ that must be paid for the pitch to succeed.
* The bottom (green) part shows _how many votes_ you may draw for this card, if the movie succeeds and it comes time to distribute the profits.

Otherwise, no rules change.
