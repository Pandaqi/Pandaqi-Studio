This game constantly fought with Maybe Missions for the spot of "simplest" Maybe Game. As I developed them, I regularly found ways to simplify the rules---and then, after testing, realized a different reason for why the rules had to be expanded again! In the end, I think they're roughly equally "simple", just ... different.

To me, this game is most thematically sound and uses the Maybe Mechanic in an elegant way. To others, the spy-themed game has more theme and feels more natural. Try them both and see which one you like best!
