{{% boardgame-intro heading="" %}}

_Maybe Games_ is collection of simple board games about voting YES or NO all the time to collect the highest score for yourself.

This is the **overview page** of the Maybe Games. 

Click any of the links below to visit a specific game. They are sorted based on complexity (according to its developer).

* [Maybe Missions](/maybe-games/vote/maybe-missions/): propose spy missions and hope enough people want them to succeed---or deviously let them fail to benefit your own secret cover.
* [Maybe Movies](/maybe-games/vote/maybe-movies/): pitch movie ideas that enough players would like to throw money at, or see your money go down the drain after another flop.
* [Maybe Minister](/maybe-games/vote/maybe-minister/): propose changes to the law of the land as you try to expand your own power, but you can only do so if the majority of the other political factions agree with the changes and vote YES.

All the games use the same core mechanic: the Maybe Mechanic. A very simple ruleset about a player proposing something and others simultaneously voting YES or NO on it. But they all provide a different theme and a few unique twists, turning them into unique experiences.

It's my never-ending goal to develop games with the absolute simplest ruleset possible. One day, I imagined a system in which all you did, every round, was cast one vote. The active player proposes something, like a spy mission. And depending on how the vote turns out, some players are rewarded and some are punished (in accordance with that proposal). Highest score wins! Simple, right?

Of course, actually developing the idea into finished games was much harder. It introduced a few more rules and tweaks. For example, in the first draft, you could get really unlucky and just start the game with only identical NO votes, which ruined your entire game.

It also revealed, however, that this core could be dressed up in different ways. It could be taken in different directions, and I've learned over the years to develop those into unique games instead of trying to "cram it all into one game". And that's how we ended up with the small set of Maybe Games. Same simple core, completely different experience based on how it's applied.
