{{% rules-block heading="Setup" icon="setup" %}}

Give everyone 8 random cards: their **lives**. Place these faceup in front of you.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

The default game mode is called **QUICKSHOT** (see the variants for other modes).

End the game as soon as one player is dead. **Player with the most lives left wins.** (If tied, player with highest possible damage on their personal cards wins.)

Every round is played _simultaneously_: everybody acts at the same time.

More specifically, everyone makes two decisions.

* Countdown (3, 2, 1); everyone makes a finger gun towards another player.
* Countdown (3, 2, 1) again; everyone points at a card in front of them _or_ one faceup on the table. (They do so using their other hand.)

Pointing should _really_ happen simultaneously. No delaying, no waiting to see what others do, no switching afterwards!

Now handle the players in clockwise order.

* If you selected a **Shield** card, you don't attack anyone. Instead, you reduce all damage taken by the number on the card. The player to whom you point, however, is the only exception: they can still attack you at full force.
* If you selected an **Attack** card, you attack the player to whom you point. You deal damage equal to the number on the card.

Some cards have special actions. Don't forget to check those.

Everyone calculates the total damage they receive this round, then removes that many cards from in front of them. Those cards go to the center of the table. 

* If you picked a card from yourself, it must be among the cards you removed.
* If you picked a card in the center of the table, it is removed permanently from the game.

Next round!

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Longshot" %}}

This variant makes the game longer than Quickshot.

Objective changes:

* Continue playing until only one player is alive. 
* **Last player standing wins.**

All the dead players still participate but in a limited way.

* They can only pick Attack cards (from the center of the table).
* Their attack is always reduced by how much damage others deal them.
* If other players picked the same card as them, they do nothing.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Gun Gang" %}}

For a more **cooperative / friendly** game,

* If you pick a defensive card, the player to whom you point is _not_ an exception.
* Instead, they _share_ your shield. (Any attacks on them are also reduced by the shield's value.)
* (OPTIONAL: This is not true if the player you point at also points back at you with an Attack card?)

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Flipping Fingers" %}}

This expansion adds the "flipping" mechanic.

* At the start of the game, half the player's cards are flipped facedown. No, you may not look at them.
* Only flip them faceup if someone points at them ( = uses them).

It also adds an extra rule.

> The **order** of the two steps of every round alternates.

Every second round, it's reversed: pick your card first, then point your finger gun.
=> ALTERNATIVE: The player currently in the lead / most behind _picks_ the order.
