This game is a silly party game idea that came to me during dinner once. Somebody made "finger guns" while telling a story about some funny event from the past. I saw that and thought: "Hey, what if making a finger gun and pointing it at another player was _a game_!?" (My brain is weird, I know.)

I was reminded of another game I played years ago, at a game night with friends, which had a similar thing (but instead gave you _cards_ with guns pointing different directions, and you had to reveal the card).

I combined those influences and came up with this game, _Finger Guns_. Very simple to play, but very fun and accessible to larger groups.
