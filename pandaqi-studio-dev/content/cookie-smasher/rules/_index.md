The website proposes "sets" of cards (ordered based on difficulty). For your first games, just pick one of those. Once you feel comfortable, you can assemble your own decks (see [variants](#variants)).

Explain all cards before the game starts, to make sure everyone has a fair chance. 

Deal the deck until empty. It's fine if some players have one more card than others.

Pick any player to be the "king".

The game ends when everyone is **out of cards**. The player with the **most points wins**.

Rounds are played simultaneously.

* Everyone picks a card from their hand. (With fewer than 4 players, you pick 2 cards.)
* Count down and simultaneously reveal them all.
* Based on the cards played, one of them will be "poisoned" (see [next section](#finding_the_poison)).
* The first player to tap this card, wins the round! (Congratulations, you've saved the king's life again!) 

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE?

The winner adds **1 card** from the table to their score pile. 

Any violation of the rules (such as tapping the wrong card) means **-3 points**: remove three cards from your score pile.

The confusion and interruption after a wrong guess makes it hard to continue fairly, so any violation ends the round instantly.

The round is now over. All other cards played are discarded. The winner/loser of this round becomes the new **king**!

_Everyone plays with one hand. That hand both reveals their own card and smashes the poisoned food. Using the wrong hand is, of course, a rules violation._

Each card shows a food item. It has a **rule**, a **number** and a **type** (animal, drink, vegetable, cereal, spice).

It's your job to rapidly consider these rules and calculate which one is **true**.

1. Evaluate cards from low to high.
2. If multiple cards have the same number, only evaluate the one closest to the king (in clockwise direction).
3. If _multiple_ are true, the card with the _highest number_ is poisoned. Smash that!
4. If _none_ are true, smash the center of the table.

Regarding rule 2: if multiple cards have the same number, the others still count! Don't remove or ignore them. You simply don't evaluate their power, which means they're **never** poisoned.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (both showing card skeleton + one round played correctly)

Later sets contain "safe food": they show a green checkmark. These are **never** poisoned themselves, but have a **permanent rule** that applies to this round.

Once you're familiar with the base game, you can try these variants or expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Assemble your own deck" %}}

You can mix and match _any_ cards you want! Below are some guidelines to help you. 

* Use at least one card from every food category. 
* Some cards have dependencies. (Examples: Cookie or Safe Food must be included.) Make sure to add those dependencies as well!
* Try to have unique numbers. (Max 2 duplicates per set.)
* Don't include too many Safe Food. (Max 2 Safe Food per set.)

Additionally, you can control difficulty and game length.

* DIFFICULTY: Including more different cards to increase difficulty.
* GAME LENGTH: There's often no need to use _all_ cards of a type you want to include. Shrink the deck for a shorter game.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Blind Smashing" %}}

This is a fun variant to try.

Instead of holding cards in your hand, everybody has their cards as a facedown deck in front of them. Each round, everyone simultaneously draws and reveals the top card.

When you _win_ a card, you stick it back into your pile wherever you want.

The last player who still has cards, wins!
