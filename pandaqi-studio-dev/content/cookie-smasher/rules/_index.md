The website proposes "sets" of cards (ordered based on difficulty). For your first games, just pick one of those. Once you feel comfortable, you can assemble your own decks (see [variants](#variants)).

Explain all cards before the game starts, to make sure everyone has a fair chance. 

Deal the deck until empty. It's fine if some players have one more card than others.

The game ends when everyone is **out of cards**. The player with the **most points wins**.

Rounds are played simultaneously.

* Everyone picks a card from their hand. (With fewer than 4 players, you pick 2 cards.)
* Once done, count down and simultaneously reveal them all.
* Based on the cards played, one of them will be "poisoned" (see [next section](#finding_the_poison)).
* The first player to tap this card, wins the round! (Congratulations, youâ€™ve saved the king's life again!) 

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE?

The winner adds **1 card** to their score pile. 

Any violation of the rules (such as tapping the wrong card) means **-3 points**: remove three cards from your score pile.

The round is now over. All other cards played are discarded.

The confusion and interruption after a wrong guess makes it hard to continue fairly, so any violation ends the round instantly.

_Everyone plays with one hand. That hand both reveals their own card and must be used for tapping the bad food. Using the wrong hand is, of course, a rules violation._

Each card shows a food item. It has a **rule**, a **number** and a **type** (animal, drink, vegetable, cereal, spice).

It's your job to rapidly consider these rules and calculate which one is **true**.

1. Evaluate cards from low to high.
2. If multiple cards have the same number, only evaluate the one closest to last round's winner (clockwise).
3. If _multiple_ are true, the card with the _highest number_ is poisoned.
4. If _none_ are true, tap your own card.

Be the first to figure out the poisoned food and tap it.

Regarding rule 2: if multiple cards have the same number, the others still count! Don't remove or ignore them. You simply don't evaluate their power, which means they're _not_ poisoned by default.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (both showing card skeleton + one round played correctly)

Later sets contain "safe food": they show a green checkmark. These are **never** poisoned themselves, but have a **permanent rule** that applies to this round.

Similarly, some cards from later sets talk about "last round's winner". These cards do _nothing_ during the first round (as there is no winner from a previous round!)

You can mix and match _any_ cards you want! Below are some guidelines to help you. 

* Only the **Cookie** is required. (Especially if other cards depend on its inclusion.) 
* Use at least one card from every food category. 
* Including more card types makes the game harder and more varied. 
* There's no need to include _all_ cards of a type: you can shrink the deck for a shorter game.

This is a fun variant to try.

Instead of holding cards in your hand, everybody has their cards as a facedown deck in front of them. Each round, everyone simultaneously draws and reveals the top card.

When you _win_ a card, you stick it back into your pile wherever you want.

The last player who still has cards, wins!
