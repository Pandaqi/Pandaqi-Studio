Pick the card types you want to include. It's recommended to have a nice blend of different food categories. Only the **Cookie**, however, is required.

Explain all cards before the game starts, to make sure everyone has a fair chance. 

Deal the deck until empty. It’s fine if some players have one more card than others.

The game ends when everyone is **out of cards**. The player with the **most points wins**.

Rounds are played simultaneously.

* Everyone picks a card from their hand. (With fewer than 4 players, you pick 2 cards.)
* Once done, count down and simultaneously reveal them all.
* Based on the cards played, one of them will be "poisoned" (see [next section](#finding_the_poison)).
* The first player to tap this card, wins the round! (Congratulations, you’ve saved the king’s life again!) 

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE?

The winner adds **1 card** to their score pile. 

Any violation of the rules (such as tapping the wrong card) means **-5 points**: remove five cards from your score pile.

The round is now over. All other cards played are discarded.

The confusion and interruption after a wrong guess makes it hard to continue fairly, so any violation ends the round instantly.

_Everyone plays with one hand. That hand both reveals their own card and must be used for tapping the bad food. Using the wrong hand is, of course, a rules violation._

Each card shows a food item. It has a **rule**, a **number** and a **type** (animal, drink, vegetable, cereal, spice).

It's your job to rapidly consider these rules and calculate which one is **true**.

* If _multiple_ are true, the card with the _higher number_ is poisoned.
* If this still leaves multiple poisoned foods, they all win you the round.
* If _none_ are true, tap the card from the player who won the previous round.

Be the first to figure out the poisoned food and tap it.
