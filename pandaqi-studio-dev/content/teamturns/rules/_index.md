Give everyone X cards. Once picked up, you may **not** change their order anymore.

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

The game ends when **everyone is out of cards**. Players count the scores of the 2-card combos they collected; **highest score wins**!

Take clockwise turns from start player until done.

On your turn, **present one card** from your hand and ask who wants to "team" with you. Players may say anything they want to convince you to pick them---or not to pick them.

Then **pick your teammate**. They must also play a card from their hand, but they may only pick one of the cards at the edges (_left-most_ or _right-most_).

Every combination of two cards _scores points_ and _creates an action_. You must now decide if you want the points or the action; your teammate gets whatever you didn't pick.

* If you want the points, you get the combo and place it in front of you.
* If you want the action, you simply execute it immediately.

If the combo is "rotten", then you must take the points yourself and the other player gets nothing.

See [Cards & Combos](#cards-and-combos) for the specifics on how they work.

{{% rules-block heading="Cards & Combos" id="cards-and-combos" %}}

Every card shows a **recipe** (which determines score) and some **food icons**. Some also show an **action**.

The recipe shows one or more _food icons_ and how much they're worth. (For example: Circle 3, Square -2.) This recipe applies to the types on the _other card_.

> For example, if card A says "Circle is worth 3", and card B has 2 circles, then card A scores 3 * 2 = 6 points.

An action is an **icon** (to make the base game textless!)

If both cards have an action, the action with the _higher number_ is the one you must choose. If none of the cards have an action, this combo is called "rotten".

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

This game has no official variants.

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Megamoves" %}}

This adds cards with some more advanced actions. 

It also adds **modifiers** instead of actions. They modify how your turns are played or which combos you're allowed to make.

Note that a modifier is _not_ an action, so if a combo only has cards with modifiers, it's still "rotten".

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Cookyclasses" %}}

This expansion adds cards with some _other_ way of scoring. (@TODO: as usual, see the original idea file for examples, and perhaps give an image/example here.)
