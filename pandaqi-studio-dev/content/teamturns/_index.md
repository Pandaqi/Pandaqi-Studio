The fonts used are **Sledge** (headings) and **Chizz** (body text). Everything else is mine.

This game is a kind of "twin game" with [Puzzle Species](/puzzle-species/). Visit that game's page and read the Credits section for more background information!

The summary is: _Teamturns_ (this game) is shorter and easier, _Puzzle Species_ (the other game) has few more rules but also more depth.
