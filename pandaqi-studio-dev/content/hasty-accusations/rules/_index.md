Pick as many different _characters_ as the number of players.
* Place one row of **faceup** characters on the table. (Below these cards, evidence piles will build during the game.)
* Place the **spyglass token** above the first.
* Shuffle and deal the remaining character cards. (Each player should have *two* secret characters: their "suspects".)
* Create a deck of **playing cards**, shuffle, and deal each player 4.

The game ends when **only 1 character is left**. The player(s) who had them as their secret suspect win!

Most treacherous player starts. Take clockwise turns until done.

{{% rules-block heading="On your turn" %}}

Play a card from your hand **facedown** on a character's evidence pile, then draw back up to 4 cards.

If you play a card at the current *spyglass* character, play it **faceup** and execute its action.

Finally, move the spyglass one character forward ( = to the right). If there is none, execute a [review](#review).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Review" id="review" %}}

When a review triggers, whatever evidence pile has the **most cards** is evaluated. (If tied, the active player picks _one_ of them to evaluate.)

> **From top to bottom, reveal each card and execute what it does.** 

If an action must be executed by a player, this is always the _active player_.

{{% remark %}}
Cards may already be faceup. Those are executed too, just like the rest.
{{% /remark %}}

If the corresponding character is **murdered**, remove them, and end this phase immediately.

If this means that none of a player's suspects are alive, they must say so. They're eliminated. They reveal their hand and give their cards to the remaining players (however they want).

Discard all cards from this evidence pile. Return the spyglass to the first character. Next turn!

Cards always have a power. As stated, this triggers when _revealed_. This happens when placed at the spyglass pile (where you play faceup), or when a pile is evaluated.

Most cards can be played anywhere, but there are some exceptions.

* A @TODO:ICON means it must be played at the (current) spyglass pile.
* A @TODO:ICON means it CAN'T be played at the (current) spyglass pile.
* A @TODO:ICON means it must be played at one of your own suspects.
* A @TODO:ICON means it CAN'T be played at one of your own suspects.

@TODO: IMAGE of card skeleton.

On the website you can pick which card set you want. For your first games, just pick the base set. As you gain experience, consider introducing more and more advanced cards.

@TODO: EXPANSIONS/VARIANTS (once I figure out what I want to do with those)

EXPANSION 1: Traitor.

EXPANSION 2: Character Powers.

VARIANT 1: Vary the number of characters. (Fewer of them means a quicker game. More of them means a longer and more strategic game)

When dealing out secret suspects, deal them all. Yes, some players might have more than others, but the game automatically balances this advantage.

VARIANT 2: Instead of drawing cards as you go, deal the _whole deck_ at the start (as fairly as possible). 

On your turn, if you have no cards,
* One of your suspects dies
* If you're not eliminated, steal 1 card from all other players and continue playing.
