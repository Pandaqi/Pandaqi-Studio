All players receive **5 cards**. The remaining cards become a (shuffled) facedown deck. 

For a **shorter game**, simply remove any number of cards from the deck. (Anybody may look at the cards removed.)

The game ends after the round when **the draw pile runs out**. All players count their score: **highest score wins**.

Each round ...
* The start player locates a new treasure (*Draw*).
* Clockwise, players take turns reacting to this treasure: *Pass, Bid, or Play*.
* This continues until all players have _Passed_.
* The treasure is split (*Split Treasure*).
* Start player advances clockwise.

Each individual step should be simple and fast. They're all explained below.

**On being a Pearate:** it's *absolutely allowed* to bluff, lie, steal, negotiate, and so forth. Bluff about what you saw inside your treasure. Strike deals. Promise to stop bidding, then break that promise. As long as you *follow the rules* explicitly stated in this rulebook.

@TODO: INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE (_or_ an overview of a full round, globally)

{{% rules-block heading="Draw" %}}

This is done by the _start player_.
* Take the bigger number: **2** or your **hand size**.
* Draw that many cards from the deck: this is the secret treasure for this round. 
* Look at the treasure and arrange the cards any way you wish.
* Then place it facedown in the center of the table.

Passing simply means doing nothing for the rest of this round.

{{% rules-block heading="Bid" %}}

You bid by placing one or more cards facedown before you. Each card is worth 1. **You DON'T need to bid more than the previous player!**

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

Play a card from your hand with an action. Execute it. Then add the card to the treasure.

{{% rules-block heading="Split Treasure" %}}

**Total bid is larger than the treasure size (a "Mutiny")?** The player with the highest bid receives the treasure. (If tied, the start player chooses.) The start player receives the highest bid; everyone else receives their own bid.

> EXAMPLE: The treasure has 4 cards. Player 1 bid 2 cards, player 2 bid 3 cards. The total bid is 5, which is higher than 4. So, the treasure is entirely given to player 2.

**Otherwise?** Treasure is *divided*. In turn order, each player takes as many cards as they put in, either all from the _top_ or all from the _bottom_. The start player receives all the bids. Leftover treasure is discarded.

Finally, everyone makes a choice about **all cards they received** during this round: either take them **all into your hand** or **score them all**. 

The hand limit is 8 cards. If you can't fit all new cards into your hand, you must score them.

"Scoring" a card simply means placing it faceup in front of you. You can't use these cards anymore.

When determining the winner at the end of the game,

> Only count types **of which you have the most** (out of all players). Ties for majority are allowed.

> EXAMPLE: You have one 7, and another player has the other two 7s. Then you score _nothing_ for this card, while the other player scores 2 x 7 = 14.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE => show keeping the cards in stacks (don't explicitly mention it in the text)

Highest score wins. If tied, the player with the most _hand cards_ wins.

Whenever an action allows you to add/remove cards, you may
* Do so from the _top_ OR the _bottom_.
* Take them from your _hand_ or from the _deck_.

Below are some clarifications in case of uncertainty about card powers.

Once you've played the base game a few times, maybe you're ready for some expansions or variants!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

**Want a friendlier game?** Use the following rules.
* If nobody bids on a treasure, the start player receives it.
* Every _trio_ of cards with a value below 4 (in your score pile), is worth +5 points.
* In the final round, you automatically score all cards received.
* Optional: remove some or all of the negative numbers.

**Want a more strict rule for resolving ties?** Use the following rule. (This variant was mostly removed to simplify your first few games.)

> In case of a tie ( = multiple players bid the most), the cards are revealed and "scored". Highest score wins. If still equal, divide the treasure between the tied players, as fairly as possible, throwing away leftover cards.

**Want a longer game?** When the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discarded cards and make it the new draw pile. You can do this once, or twice, or however long you want the game to last.

This one adds more cards with special actions.

@TODO: Rules-table? What's the point?

You're also allowed to **strike deals** using cards received in a round. For example, you might promise somebody part of your treasure if they stop bidding *now*. Whether somebody follows up on their promises ...

Once a card is definitively scored or in your hand, however, you can't strike any more deals with it.

{{% rules-block heading="Coins for Combos" %}}

This one introduces cards that **score** in a special way. (This takes the same space as an action, so these cards always have **no action**.)

It also adds cards with a _question mark_ for their number (**wildcards**). When played or scored, they are any number you want.
