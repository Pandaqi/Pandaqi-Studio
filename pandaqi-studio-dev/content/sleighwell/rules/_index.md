During the game, you'll deliver presents to houses. The game ends when ...

* You've managed to score _all houses_ (in the deck)!
* Or it's impossible to do so (most likely because everyone is out of tiles).

Sum the stars on the houses you scored: that's your final score! 

If you scored **all houses**, you've beat the game and have proven yourself worthy Santa Clauses!

{{% rules-block id="action_play" heading="Gameplay" icon="action" class="force-page-break-before" icontint="purple" %}}

Take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, take one action: **PLAY**, **REINDEER** or **MOVE**.

The rules below hold true regardless of the action you take.

* You're **never** allowed to split the board into multiple parts. Everything needs to stay connected at all times.
* You're allowed to discuss and strategize together, but **never** allowed to show or communicate your exact cards. 
* A **"?"** icon (@TODO: just do an inline image!) is a **wildcard** and represents any value you want.

After your turn, always draw back up to 5 tiles.

@TODO: INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE?

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE of applying wildcards + splitting the board (and how it's not allowed)?

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

Play a tile from your hand. It must be next to an existing tile.

> Numbers in rows/columns must always be either ascending or descending.

EXAMPLE: Say a row already has the cards "3" and "8". Then you may only place a higher number behind the "8", or a lower number before the "3". Because the sequence must stay ascending.

If this isn't true for a sequence (which can happen when doing the REINDEER action), you **can't add a tile to that sequence**.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Reindeer" %}}

Discard a tile from your hand (to pay for this action).

Then,
* Pick an existing tile next to a **group of reindeer**. (At least two connected reindeer tiles.) 
* Move this tile to a _new_ destination adjacent to this group.
* If this destination already contains a tile, swap them. 

You **don't have to follow** the placement rules from the PLAY action (ascending / descending number)!

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Sleigh" %}}

Move the **sleigh** in a straight line towards another tile. (In other words, the destination is on the same row or column).

All tiles you pass along the way are **removed from the table**.

If you ended on a **house**, and the tiles you removed satisfy the **wishes of that house**, you score it! Remove the house as well and place it on your score pile.

{{% rules-block id="expansion" heading="Variants & Expansions" icon="score" class="force-page-break-before" icontint="purple" %}}

Try any of the variants to make the base game fit better with your specific player group. And once you have a few games under your belt, add an expansion to spice it up! 

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

**Want a shorter/easier game?** Pick one or multiple of the changes below.

* Include fewer houses. For each house left out, though, also remove a random other tile from the deck.
* Start with the lowest value building (just wants 1 present of any type) next to the sleigh. This immediately gives you something to aim for and something to score.
* Use _two_ sleighs.

**Want to play solo?**

* You get 7 tiles in your hand.
* After each turn, draw 2 tiles from the deck. For each, decide whether to play or discard it.
* (@TODO:Insert special "solo" tiles showing a sleigh/reindeer? When they appear, you _must_ take that action next turn.)

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Special Sleighs" %}}

This expansion adds special tiles.
* Those that show **two things** (such as two different presents).
* Those that have an **action**. It can trigger when played (HAND ICON), moved (REINDEER ICON), or removed (SLEIGH ICON). 

It also adds some special houses (mostly harder ones) that have an **action**. The action triggers when you score this house.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Tough Trees" %}}

This expansion adds the **Christmas Tree** tile.
* It is **not removed** when doing the sleigh action.
* It can **not** move using reindeers.
* When placed, you draw **2 tiles** at the end of your turn (instead of 1). This _permanently_ raises your hand limit by 1. These tiles may be taken either from the table or the deck.
