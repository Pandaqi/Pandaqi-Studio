## Setup

Generate/pick a paper and print it.

All players grab a pen and pick a "pattern" (+color) printed on the paper. They start the game at the "anchor square" of that pattern.

The Tetris shape displayed in the top-left becomes the current "drawing shape". (Later, during the game, player actions will regularly change what kind of shape you must draw on your turn.)

## Objective

The game ends as soon as one player **can't move anymore**. Players calculate their **score** by checking all squares they "encircled" during the game.

## Gameplay

Take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, draw the current (Tetris) **shape**.

* It can't overlap with any existing shapes.
* It can't go out of bounds (which includes overlapping holes).
* It must connect with a previous shape of yours.

If you can't make any move, restart at a new "anchor square" (if possible).

That's it!

## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variant: Solo Ships

Pick this option if you don't like the high interaction from the base game and want players to just play solo.

If enabled, it will generate a paper with _multiple maps_ that are completely separated. Every player simply picks one of those maps and plays within that. 

This also has a few other benefits.

* This allows _simultaneous_ turns. (If multiple people pick a shape changer, the one with the higher number is picked for the next round; that's another reason to uniquely number them.)
* This doesn't require people using different "patterns".

### Expansion: New Routes

This expansion adds more advanced actions (called PATHERS and LIMITERS). 

They explain themselves on the paper. Below are some **clarifications** to remove any uncertainty.

* Any sequence of connected shapes by the same player is called one **"path"**.
* Two icons are called **"connected"** if they're both inside the same "path". (In other words, there's an unbroken route of squares between them that are all encircled by the same player.)
* An icon is inside an **"encircled area"** if it's completely surrounded by edges of other shapes, with no gap. The original edge of the board is considered a gap/"unused".
