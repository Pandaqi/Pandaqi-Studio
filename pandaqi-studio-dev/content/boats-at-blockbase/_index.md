The fonts used are **Sea Gardens** (headings) and **Chelsea** (body text). Everything else is mine.

The original idea for this game is quite directly inspired by the game _Silver & Gold_. It also features drawing "Tetris-like" shapes on cards to get the things you want. When I encountered that game, I immediately knew this was such a simple but effective mechanic to use for a One Paper Game!

As usual, I did away with all the extra fluff. (That game that inspired me has all these little scoring rules, and extra rules about drawing/completing cards, and all this extra material. I'm about minimalism and really try to simplify every game as much as possible.) I added more interaction between players and included some ideas I thought were cool and only possible because it's a One Paper Game now.

As it happens, this game ended up waaaay different than its original inspiration. A nice little game you can print and play anywhere, with rules so simple and intuitive that I can confidently say it's for all ages and backgrounds.
