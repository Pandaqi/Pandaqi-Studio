The fonts used are **MESY** (for headings) and **Margherita** (for text). The first is extremely thematic, the second is an absolutely beautiful font (that comes in many variations) that I now want to use in _everything_.

The style of this game is a blend of Aztec, Maya and general Mesoamerican patterns and illustrations. I initially wanted to stay true to the real descriptions of mythological creatures/gods from those cultures, but that proved too difficult. They either looked too alike, or too gruesome (for a family friendly party game), or too overwhelming (with ten arms and tongues and what not).

As such, my monster illustrations are basically the "generalized" version of these creatures. Most of them were created using image AI (specifically the latest DALL-E), though I had to manually repaint large parts (with different colors or patterns) to keep the style consistent. Everything else is entirely my work.

Fun fact: I spent a loooong time trying to find a title. I tried every possible variation of Bodyguard I could imagine (TribeGuard, ClanGuard, ClanKeeper, TribeKeeper, etcetera), but all of them were taken already. Some by minor accounts in a corner of the internet, some by major corporations or apps.

It's fine if multiple projects have the same name (there are plenty characters and games called "Bodyguard", for example), but only if it's a _generic_ name. If I give my projects a more _specific_ name, then it should really be unique and never seen before. Otherwise you're floating in some weird middle ground in which the title of your project doesn't serve its purpose however you look at it.
