Create a deck of cards, but keep the _Emperor_ separate. Shuffle and deal until empty. (It's fine if some players have one more card than others.)

It's important to sit/stand and play cards roughly in a circle. Otherwise, anything goes!

Cards come in three flavors: attackers, protectors and bystanders. You can assemble your own custom deck, as long as you make sure each of these is represented.

The game ends as soon as a player is **out of cards**. Whoever **has the most cards** wins!

Turns happen simultaneously.

* All players pick one card from their hand and place it face-down in front of them.
* After everyone has chosen, the winner of last round swaps _one_ card for the Emperor (kept to the side).
* Now reveal all the cards (at the same time).

In the first round, the youngest player swaps the Emperor.

Now all players are looking for one rule. (Explained in more detail in the [next section](#attacking).)

> Is there **a card** that would **prevent** the emperor from being attacked if it were removed or rotated? 

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE (reveal + search the rule + handle scoring)

Be the first to find this card and smash it to win! If there is **no such card**, tap the emperor.

As soon as somebody smashed a card, the round is over. 

* They were right? They add one of the cards played into their hand, discard the rest.
* They were wrong? They remove 5 cards from their hand (as the penalty), all cards played are discarded.

{{% remark %}}
Never discard the Emperor. Keep it to the side for next round.

Each card shows somebody **facing right**. By playing/revealing the card upside down, you can make them face to the **left**.

How do you check what happens in a given round?

* Evaluate the cards played, starting with the **emperor** and moving in the **direction they face**.
* Attackers will automatically **attack** in the direction they face. This means they'll _hit_ the first card they encounter.

Any cards hit are eliminated. Pretend they don't exist anymore, removed from the circle. 

{{% remark %}}
Yes, this means an attacker who is already hit will not attack anymore.
{{% /remark %}}

It's your job to check if the emperor is hit. If so, find one card that, if it were removed/rotated, would prevent that. (And if such a card doesn't exist, or the emperor isn't hit, you smash the emperor.)

Many cards have special powers, though, that will change the trajectory and consequences of attacks in surprising ways ...

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE of how to resolve one round (the playful example will be much better in explaining this)
