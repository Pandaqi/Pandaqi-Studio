Create a deck of slider cards.

* Draw 3 sliders at random and place them in front of the start player. These are the guessing sliders.
* Draw another one and place it in the center of the table. This is the action slider.

Shuffle the deck of **word cards**. (Or open the [website](/slippery-slope) on a phone and use that to receive random words!)

The default is to play **cooperatively**. Your goal is simply to score as many points as possible within 10 rounds!

You can also play **competitively**: split the players into two teams, those with the most points after 10 rounds win.

Each turn has two simple steps: **change sliders** and **communicate**. Read the rules below or click the button to get a random example turn.

You receive the three guessing sliders from the previous player. Now ...

* Draw a random word card and secretly pick 1 word from it.
* Place one of the guessing sliders on top of the action slider, replacing it.
* Draw a new guessing slider from any of the piles.

If you play competitively, the teams simply alternate taking their turn.

Start a [timer](https://pandaqi.com/tools/timer). The recommended duration is 1 or 2 minutes.

You must communicate your secret word ... using only the sliders. 

> Use another card (sideways, facedown) on each guessing slider to indicate where you think your word ranks.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (a word + marking properties on sliders)

Others can guess as much as they like, and you can change your markings as you go. 

If somebody guesses the correct word, you score **5 points**. If time runs out, your turn is over with **0 points**.

While guessing, other players can also **tap an action** on the current action slider to activate it. Each action, however,

* Can only be taken once.
* And reduces the score for this word by **1 point**.

Below is a table of all actions and what they mean.

This expansion adds three things: more slider types, a new rule, and a way to differentiate which slider is most important.

**Slider Types**: the additions are **words**, **shapes** and **color**. You can create separate decks for them (easier) or shuffle them all into one deck (harder). Everything else is the same: use a card to indicate a specific point on the slider.

**New Rule**: players are allowed to pick how many sliders they want: 2, 3, 4 or 5. Discard and re-draw whatever is needed.

{{% remark %}}
Having more sliders on your turn might seem beneficial ( = you can be more specific), but it can also hurt you, as you must set them _all_!
{{% /remark %}}

**Slider Priority**: by using a stack of _multiple_ face-down sliders to indicate the same spot, you communicate that this specific guessing slider is _more important_ than the others.
