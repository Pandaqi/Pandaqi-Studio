Create a deck of **slider cards**. Draw 4 sliders at random and place them in front of the start player.

Shuffle the deck of **word cards**. (Or open the [website](/slippery-slope) on a phone and use that to receive random words!)

That's it!

The default is to play **cooperatively**. Your goal is simply to score as many points as possible within 10 rounds!

You can also play **competitively**: split the players into two teams, those with the most points after 10 rounds win.

Take clockwise turns. Each turn has two simple steps: **change sliders** and **communicate**.

{{% remark class="anchor-top" %}}
If you play competitively, teams simply alternate turns.

{{% rules-block id="change_sliders" heading="Change Sliders" %}}

You receive the sliders from the previous player. 

Now ...

* Draw a random word card and secretly pick **1 word** from it.
* **Remove** one or more sliders, but never _all_ of them.
* Draw equally many **new sliders**.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block id="communicate" heading="Communicate" %}}

Start a [timer](https://pandaqi.com/tools/timer). The recommended duration is 1 or 2 minutes.

You must communicate your secret word ... using only the sliders. 

> **Use another card (sideways, facedown) on each slider to indicate where you think your word ranks.**

Others can guess as much as they like, and you can change your markings as you go. You obviously can't communicate in _any_ other way during your turn.

If somebody guesses the correct word, you score **5 points**. If time runs out, your turn is over with **0 points**.

That's it! Have fun!

{{% rules-block id="expansion_glidy_gifts" heading="Glidy Gifts" %}}

Sliders now also show _actions_. When you remove a slider, place it in the center of the table instead: it becomes the current **action slider**.

{{% remark %}}
There's only one action slider at any time, so place new ones on top of the old ones.
{{% /remark %}}

While guessing, other players can **tap an action** on the action slider to activate it. 

Each action, however,

* Can only be taken once.
* And reduces the score for this word by **1 point**.

Below is a table of all actions and what they mean.

{{< rules-table >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Add" icon="add" >}}
        Draw two extra sliders and mark your word on those.
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Replace" icon="replace" >}}
        Replace one or more sliders by new ones.
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Ignore" icon="ignore" >}}
        You may ignore one or more sliders. (Don't mark anything on them.)
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Double" icon="double" >}}
        Place two markers on the same slider (to indicate two separate values).
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Hint" icon="hint" >}}
        Give a one-word hint, but it can't be a word from your card.
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Category" icon="category" >}}
        Say the category to which your secret word belongs.
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Order" icon="order" >}}
        Explain the order of importance of your sliders. (Which is the best hint, the second-best, ...)
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}
<!-- -->
    {{< rules-table-entry heading="Property" icon="property" >}}
        Rename the ends of a slider to two different properties. Now mark your secret word on that new scale!
    {{< /rules-table-entry >}}

{{% rules-block id="expansion_crashery_cliffs" heading="Crashery Cliffs" %}}

This expansion adds three things: more slider types, a new rule, and a way to differentiate which slider is most important.

**Slider Types**: the additions are **words**, **shapes** and **color**. You can create separate decks for them (easier) or shuffle them all into one deck (harder). Everything else is the same: use a card to indicate a specific point on the slider.

**New Rule**: players are allowed to pick how many sliders they want. This can be any number between 2 and 7. Discard and re-draw whatever is needed.

{{% remark %}}
Having more sliders on your turn might seem beneficial ( = you can be more specific), but it can also hurt you, as you must mark something on _all_ of them!
{{% /remark %}}

**Slider Priority**: by using a stack of _multiple_ facedown sliders (to mark the same spot), you communicate that this specific guessing slider is _more important_ than the others.
