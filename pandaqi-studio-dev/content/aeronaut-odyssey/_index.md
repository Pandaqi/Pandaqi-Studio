To approximate an average Ticket to Ride board, choose the "large" board size, and "use real material". Also make sure your printer doesn't add very large margins, as that might make the spaces too small.

If you increase the board size, it's recommended to also increase print size. Otherwise things get too small. (If you **use real material**, it does so automatically. Then the blocks obviously need to stay the same size as the plastic trains from the real game and can't shrink.)
