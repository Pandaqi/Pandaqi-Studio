{{% rules-block id="setup" heading="Setup" icon="setup" icontint="pink" %}}

Create a deck with 5 cards per player (the actual cards inside do not matter). Shuffle. Deal all players 5 cards.

{{% rules-block id="objective" heading="Objective" icon="objective" icontint="blue" %}}

The game ends when a player is **out of cards**, _or_ all players have decided they're **done**.

The winner is the player with the strongest squad in their hand.

Youngest player starts. Take clockwise turns. On your turn ...

* Pick an opponent who is not "done".
* Pick a number: 1, 2 or 3.
* You and your opponent choose that many cards from your hand (your **Squad**)
* Reveal your squads at the same time and decide who wins (see [next section](#squads))
* Trade squads. (You get the opponent's squad, they get yours.) However, the winner picks one card that they do **not** have to give away.

You can't pick a number larger than the number of cards you or your opponent have. 

After the fight, if you're satisfied with your squad, you can decide to stop. Say "I'm Done!" You don't get any more turns. (Un-spread your hand to signal this.)

Your opponent can do so too, _after_ you've chosen what to do.

Creatures have one main type (large, centered). Underneath it is the type it Counters. (As a reminder; this is always the same.) The rest of the card has a mix of icons.

@TODO: Image of card layout + elements named

Determine your squad's strength with three simple steps.

1.	The player who has the most **action** icons, executes **one** of their actions.
2.	Check the main types your opponent has. Any types they Counter are worth **nothing** for you.
3.	Each remaining type icon is worth +1 point.

The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the defender wins.

When calculating your score at the **end of the game**, pretend youâ€™re fighting **your own hand**! (Its main types Counter yourself.)

@TODO: Image showing how an attack is resolved, and what the squad scores at the end of the game.

{{% rules-block id="types" heading="Types" class="force-page-break-before" icon="expansion" icontint="yellow" %}}

Each game will have 4 elements (red, blue, green, purple). Each element has 4 options to choose from, which you can pick on the website.

Each action tells you whether it must be executed BEFORE the fight or AFTER it.

On the website, you can turn on "multitype" (optional). This means an icon can show two types at once. Choose which one it is _after_ revealing squads.

{{% rules-block id="red" heading="Red" %}}

Red stands for aggression, attacking, destroying. It counters Purple.

About the "Magic" action:

* If you continue the fight, reveal the extra secret cards and continue as normal.
* If you cancel the fight, both players take their squads back into their hand, and nothing more happens.
