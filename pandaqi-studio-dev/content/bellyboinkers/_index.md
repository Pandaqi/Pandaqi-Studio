What's inside? Everything you asked for. Even more. Or not. We don't know what you asked for. Anyway, the **base game** has ...

* **13 Arenas.**
* **17 Playable Characters.**
* **Controller + Keyboard support.** You can split controllers (two players on one). Four players max on the keyboard.
* **Customizable.** Choose how many rounds games last, game speed, colors, teams, play however you like.
* **Dedicated solo mode.**
* **No tutorial or long-winded introductions.** It's not necessary.

More content can be found in the [expansions](#expansions)

Arenas always put one unique twist on the idea. Maybe the floor is replaced by gigantic wobbly seesaws. Maybe random parts of the floor turn into conveyor belts. Anything can happen!

The **free demo** includes 4 characters and the (first) 4 arenas, playable without any restrictions.

This game is a **local multiplayer party game**. It's for **all ages** and **extremely accessible**.

Why? Because your only button is for _moving around_. Even the jump button is optional in easier arenas. Doesn't get simpler than that.

Fall off the field? You're dead!

Bump into someone? You bounce away from each other with unrealistically large force.

Don't expect a deeply strategical or skillful game. Expect a game that is immediate fun for anyone, and gets more fun the more players you add.

Nobody likes being eliminated in games, especially not local multiplayer ones.

That's why this game uses **rounds**. A round lasts 60 seconds at most, but usually much shorter. When done, you _immediately_ reset, all players revived, and continue playing.

To win the **game**, win the most rounds.

Arenas are ordered on skill level. The first require nearly no skill to play, while the last arenas heavily reward "knowing what on earth you're doing".

</div>

Want to play solo? You'll be pitted against AI enemies. Eight types can appear, each with a very simple and "dumb" behavior.

A timer elevates the challenge. If you don't remove all AI before it runs out, you lose. But if you manage to win very rapidly, you get double the points!

Extra content is divided into “expansions”!

@TODO: List Expansions + make clickable

**Why?** So you can buy exactly as much Bellyboinkers as you want, no more, no less!

**How does it work?** Each expansion has its own page. When bought, you get a single file. The base game comes with a folder called “expansions”: drop the file in there and you're done!

Encountered a bug? Want to see something in the game? Have other feedback or comments?

Let me know: [schoolofpanda@gmail.com](mailto:schoolofpanda@gmail.com)

Enjoying the game? Also let me know! It's extremely rare that a player lets me know who they are and how they enjoyed the game, which is a shame, as those are the stories I want to hear.

Want more? Try any of my other games.
