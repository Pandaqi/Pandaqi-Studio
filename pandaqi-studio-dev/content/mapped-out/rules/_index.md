Create a deck of **Movement Cards** and a pile of **Map Tiles**.

* Each player receives **10 random movement cards**. Place these cards in a row before you, facedown, without looking.
* Each player also receives a **pawn** and **5 map tiles** to take into their hand.

Place the **starting tile** in the center, with all player's Pawns on top.

The game ends when all pawns have moved their entire path ( = execute their movement cards from left to right). Calculate your score from the tiles on the map that you visited---highest score wins!

{{% rules-block heading="Gameplay" icon="action" %}}

The overall game has two "parts": **create the map** and **walk over it**.

{{% rules-block heading="Create the Map" %}}

Take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, **play a map tile**.

* Add the tile from your hand to the shared map on the table. (There are no other rules to placement; paths don't need to match in the base game.)
* Every tile also has a "place action" that triggers now.

There are three possible place actions. Note that these actions can be applied to your _own_ Movement Cards .. or someone else's.

* REVEAL (@TODO: ICON = card faded, bent arrow, card revealed + number): reveal a Movement Card at the _position_ indicated. (If this card is already revealed, do nothing.)
* SWAP (@TODO: ICON = arrows left/right): swap two Movement Cards
* STUDY (@TODO: ICON = eye + number): secretly look at as many Movement Cards as the number indicated.

Finally, draw a new map tile from the deck into your hand.

This phase ends as soon as one player has **revealed all their movement cards**.

{{% rules-block heading="Walk over It" %}}

In clockwise order, players simply walk the path before them, following their Movement Cards from left to right. (Reveal any cards that are yet unrevealed.)

* **Move your pawn** according to what each card says (left/right/up/down/nothing).
* Keep track of the fishes on all the tiles you visited, and find out which **type of fish** you visited the **most**.
* That type of fish scores +1 point per fish for you.

This phase ends once everyone has walked the map and calculated their score. Highest score wins!

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

For a **much easier** game, allow players to see all their Movement Cards before the game starts. Shuffle before placing them facedown before you.

For an **easier** game, allow players to decide how to rotate the cards they reveal. (After revealing, they can choose whether to keep it that way, or flip it upside-down.)

For a **harder game**: if you play a map tile with the REVEAL action, but your movement card is already revealed, flip it back facedown.

This is a big upgrade to the core rules of the game, but requires no extra material. Instead of people moving their entire path, one after another, people follow their path _at the same time_ and can _interact_.

When the **walk** phase starts, everyone reveals their entire row of Movement Cards _and_ their hand of map tiles.

Then, take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, 

* Check your left-most Movement Card.
* Move your pawn according to what it says.
* Discard the card you used for moving.

Of course, it's too hard to track your score in your head now. That's why you'll do it by building a **score pile** as you move.

* After moving, if you _want_, pick up your new tile and place it on your personal score pile. 
* Then replace the tile (which you just took out of the map) with one from your hand.
* If your hand is empty, you _can't pick up any more tiles_ (and thus not score anything more).

If you bump into another player ( = end on the same tile as them), move them to any adjacent tile on the map.

This phase now continues until all players have completed their entire movement. At that point, everyone checks the tiles/cards inside their score pile, and determines their score that way.

@IDEA: In certain situations, you can execute your instructions "so far". This will lock in that movement and give you more certainty about where you are for the rest of it. => This basically requires this expansion to be active, so players already have that framework for "movement happen one-at-a-time, not in a big chunk at the end"

This expansion adds more possible **Map Tiles**.

* Negative points / Negative effects / Raw points
* Islands => trying to move here will fail; you simply don't move. => Everything else is just **clear water tiles** (on all sides).
* Could be map-changers (you teleport, you take a tunnel, you return to start, you remove one tile at will, etcetera)
* Stuff that only scores in very specific SETS / COMBINATIONS

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE?

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Unclear Instructions" %}}

This expansion adds more possible **Movement Cards**.

* NEW MOVEMENT: Teleport / Jump
* NEW MOVEMENT: Go to closest tile of type "X" / that shows "Y"

It also adds Movement Cards with an action. This action triggers _when revealed_. (Not when following the movement in the later phase.)

* Could be path-changers (ignore your next card, remove one card at random, etcetera) => so we DO need a pawn for each player to make executing this phase much easier
* Could be that you literally score that card if its movement matches landing on a certain tile. (For example, the movement card is scored if you land on a tile with fish A or B.)
