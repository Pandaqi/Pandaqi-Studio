Pick a set from [the website](https://pandaqi.com/pumpkin-patrol). For your first games, just play the starter set.

Each player receives 4 **Hand Cards**. Hand cards always show _two_ things at the same time: you must always pick only _one_ of the options when you use the card.

Place the remaining Hand Cards as a shuffled facedown deck.

Also create a shuffled facedown deck of **Person Cards**. You can make this deck as large as you want, but it must contain at least one card per player. (The bigger you make this, the longer the game plays.)

For each player, draw 1 Person Card and place it faceup in front of them. (They are at your home, but they're not "yours".)

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE (of setup, but also card skeletons and the general idea with building a home and stuff)

The game ends as soon as **all Persons have been scored**.  Players sum the points on the Persons they scored: **highest score wins!**

Play happens in rounds. Rounds have two phases: PLAY and WALK.

_What's the general idea?_ During the game, players create a row of cards in front of them. (They decorate their home.) You need that to attract Persons and ask them to stop at your front door.

But that's not enough. Balance building your decorations with building your bowl of treats. Because to score any visitor, you also need to pay the Treats they require.

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

Take clockwise turns. On your turn, take **two actions**. 

The possible actions are:
* ADD: Add a card from your hand to your home. Make sure the side you want ( = which specific decoration) points up.
* REMOVE: Discard a card from your home or hand. Draw 2 new Hand Cards from the deck (into your hand).

{{% rules-block heading="Walk" %}}

All Persons on the table walk. (This can be done simultaneously!)

* They move to the player on their right.
* If that player fulfills their Home requirements, they stop there.
* If they've now made a full circle, they also stop there.
* Otherwise, they keep walking. (Repeat the three steps above.)

Once done, players _may_ score anyone currently at their front door. For each visiting Person you want to score,

* Pay their Treat requirements. (Discard those cards from your hand.)
* Place the Person card facedown in your score pile.
* Draw a new Person card and place it faceup in front of you. (This is for next round. You can't score them.)

Start player moves one to the left. Next round!

Once you're familiar with the base game, you can try the more advanced sets!

{{% rules-block heading="Beginner Set" %}}

This set adds three new mechanics.

**Powers**: people can have a special power. Such a power is indicated by the _heart_ icon, and replaces the funny tagline.

These can be permanent or triggered at a specific moment.

* "On walk": execute at the _start_ of the walking phase ( = "just before walking").
* "On visit": execute at the _end_ of the walking phase ( = "everyone is done walking").
* "On score": execute when you pay treats and score this card.

**"At Most"**: some people have an "at most" requirement. They will only visit if you have **no decorations besides the ones they accept**. 

Example: 

* Say somebody wants "at most 2 pumpkins"
* They will visit if you have 1 Pumpkin
* They will not visit if you have 1 Pumpkin and 1 Spider, as the Spider is "too much".
* They will not visit if you have 3 Pumpkins, as the third Pumpkin is "too much".

It also adds new treats and decorations. These have a different value / probability behind the scenes, but change no rules for players.

{{% rules-block heading="Advanced Set" %}}

This set adds two new mechanics.

**Card Requirements**: instead of requiring specific types, they just want a number of _cards_.

**Set Requirements**: instead of requiring specific types, they just want a _set_. There are two options.
* "Same" (equals sign): they want X icons of the _same_ type. (The type itself doesn't matter, as long as the whole set is the same one.)
* "Different" (not-equals sign): they want X icons that are all a _different_ type.

{{% rules-block heading="Expert Set" %}}

This adds no new rules. It simply contains the people with the toughest powers, and of course uses everything introduced before now.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Assemble your own deck" %}}

You can combine sets to create your own deck.

* Make sure the icons on Person and Hand cards match. (That's why it's recommended to include all or most of a set.)
* Make sure there's enough variety in the Person scores.

However, sets are randomly generated! This means a specific card (e.g. "Vampire") is never the same, and also that a set is balanced with _itself_. It's recommended to just play specific sets _or_ generate an entirely new "Random" set.
