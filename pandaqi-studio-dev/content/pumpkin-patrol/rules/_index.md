Pick a set from [the website](https://pandaqi.com/pumpkin-patrol). For your first games, just play the starter set.

Each player receives 4 **Hand Cards**. Hand cards always show _two_ things at the same time: you must always pick only _one_ of the options when you use the card.

Place the remaining Hand Cards as a shuffled facedown deck.

Also create a shuffled facedown deck of **Person Cards**. You can make this deck as large as you want, but it must contain at least one card per player. (The bigger you make this, the longer the game plays.)

For each player, draw 1 Person Card and place it faceup in front of them. (They are at your home, but they're not "yours".)

The game ends as soon as **all Persons have been scored**. 

Players sum the points on the Persons they scored. **Highest score wins!**

Play happens in rounds. Rounds have two phases: PLAY and WALK.

_What's the general idea?_ During the game, players create a row of cards in front of them. (They decorate their home.) You need that to attract Persons and ask them to stop at your front door.

But that's not enough. Balance building your decorations with building your bowl of treats. Because to score any visitor, you also need to pay the Treats they require.

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

Take clockwise turns. On your turn, you must do **two actions**. 

The possible actions are:
* ADD: Add a card from your hand to your home. Make sure the side you want ( = which specific decoration) points up.
* REMOVE: Discard a card from your home or hand. Draw 2 new Hand Cards from the deck (into your hand).

{{% rules-block heading="Walk" %}}

Handle all Persons on the table one by one. The player with the **most decorated home** decides the order. (If tied, the one closest to the start player decides.)

Walking works as follows.

* The Person walks to the player on their right.
* If that player fulfills their Home requirements, they stop there.
* If they've now made a full circle, they also stop there.
* Otherwise, they keep walking to the right.

Once all Persons have found their new home, players can score them.

* Pay their Treat requirements. (Discard those cards from your hand.)
* Place the Person card facedown in your score pile.
* Draw a new Person card and place it faceup in front of you.

Start player moves one to the left. Next round!

<!--- @TODO: This game will probably not have expansions, so just make this a list of small variants and that's it? -->
{{% rules-block id="expansions" heading="Expansions" icon="expansion"  icontint="purple" %}}

Once you're familiar with the base game, you can try these variants or expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Assemble your own deck" %}}

You can combine sets to create your own deck.

* Make sure the icons on Person and Hand cards match. (That's why it's recommended to include all or most of a set.)
* Make sure there's enough variety in the Person scores.

However, sets are randomly generated! This means a specific card (e.g. "Vampire") is never the same, and also that a set is balanced with _itself_. It's recommended to just play specific sets _or_ generate an entirely new "Random" set.
