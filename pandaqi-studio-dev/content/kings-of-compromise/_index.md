You want more elves. They want fewer farms. A third player somehow really loves trees. You're obviously not going to simply _say_ what you want, so you'll need to discover the wishes of the other players _while_ designing the perfect kingdom.

<!-- Introduction + explanation text -->
## What's the idea?

Everyone receives a list of **secret wishes**. The kingdom starts in a state that doesn't make _anybody_ happy!

Each turn, however, you're allowed to change **one thing** about the kingdom and ask the others if they're happy with that.

Try to figure out everyone's wishes, and communicate your own, to design the perfect kingdom before time runs out. 


## What do I need?

**Phone?** You only need a device (and internet) to generate the setup. Once that's done, you can put it away.

**Offline version?** Besides the rulebook you'll also find a folder called "Premade Games". Pick one, print it, cut the hints into cards, and you can play completely offline at some later point in time.

## Feedback & Credits

Played the game? Let me know what you think! Mail me at [schoolofpanda@gmail.com](mailto:schoolofpanda@gmail.com)
          
Fonts? **Grenze Gotisch** for most text, freely available on Google Fonts.

Website (boards and game)? The **Phaser 3** library for displaying the map graphics. Otherwise vanilla **JavaScript**.

How does this game work? It relies on an algorithm I programmed. It designs a set of wishes and a kingdom that satisfies all of them. Then it scrambles that "perfect kingdom" to get the starting map, and simply distributes the wishes evenly over the players. (It's way more complicated, but this is the gist of it.)

Want to know how I made that? I've written articles!
