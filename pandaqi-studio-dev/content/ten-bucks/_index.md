This game proves to Sia that you _do_ need dollar bills to have fun tonight.

I was disappointed to hear this game did not feature my favorite character Bucks Bunny.

Really fun game, but these colorful dollar bills are a true choking hazard once players try to put their money where their mouth is.

This game has a special origin. The devlog explains this far better, but I'll give the summary here. It's based on a silly personality trait that my brother used to have: whenever it was funny, his response would be "ten bucks" or "that will cost you ten bucks" or something similar. (Also when it wasn't as funny, but then _that_ made it funny.)

As such, to honor him, I decided to make a simple game where everything came back to "10 dollar". The only material are dollar bills, there are only a handful very simple rules for playing/claiming them, and the objective is to earn 10 dollar before anyone else.

This is probably my most lightweight game ever: even with all expansions enabled, the amount of material for this game is almost nothing, and the rules just a single page. Whether it's any good is up to the judgment of others ...
