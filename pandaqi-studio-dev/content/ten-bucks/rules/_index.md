## Setup

Only use the dollar bills with numbers **1** up to and including the **number of players**. (Example: with 4 players, use dollars 1--4.)

Combine these into a single deck, shuffle, and deal fairly. (Place any leftovers faceup in the center of the table.)

Pick anyone to be start player.

**Low player count?** With only 2 or 3 players, the base game can be too "simplistic". It's recommended to already add (any) expansion.

For the base game, just ignore special icons on the dollar bills.

## Objective

The game ends when a player has claimed **10(+) money** in total. They win!

## Gameplay

From start player, take clockwise turns until done. 

On your turn, you **must play a card**. Add a card from your hand to the table. Group them into "stacks" of the same value: if the number already exists, place your new card on top.

Then you **may claim a stack**. Take the entire stack of dollar bills (of the same value) and place them before yourself.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE (very simple one; just to show general turn approach and handling, maybe even winning objective)

At all times, however, remember the Three Laws of Claiming!

* **Diversity:** you can't claim a number you claimed before, or the one you just played.
* **Five Max:** if you create a stack of total value 5(+), you must _force_ a player to claim. You may do this immediately or at the end of your turn. This player can be yourself, but it must be someone who _can_ claim (if possible).
* **Slow Down:** your number of stacks can never be more than 1 ahead of the player with the fewest stacks claimed.

Finally, after claiming, you must permanently reveal all your hand cards of the same value. (Turn them around in your hand so they face the other players.)

That's it!

## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variants

This game has no official variants.

### Wild Wagers

This expansion adds the **wild bill**. It is, as expected, a wildcard.

* You can place it on any stack. If so, it becomes the same number as the bill below it.
* For that reason, though, it _can't_ start a new stack.

Normally, it keeps its value after claiming. But you _can_ play with the following variant: _Once claimed, a wild bill is always worth 2._

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (side-view)?

### Zero Risk

This expansion adds a large number of **0-dollar bills**.

It ignores the **Diversity** law. That is, you can claim the 0 stack _even when you played to it this turn_ or _already claimed it before_.

It also gives a new way to **win**:

> If anyone is able to claim 10(+) 0-dollar bills (in total), they instantly win the game.

<!--- (On its own, this basically means only a SINGLE player can go for this. But with expansions that allow stealing, negotiating, wildcards, this makes it possible for multiple players.) --->

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (side-view)

### Bad Investment

This expansion adds some **weird numbers** (-2, -1, 7) and **multinumbers**. These show multiple different values, and can be placed on any one of those stacks.

When it comes to the Diversity Law, the value at the _top_ of a stack counts.

### Action Fund

This expansion requires no extra material. From now on, the **special icons** on dollar bills matter!

These actions trigger in two situations.

* When you play the card.
* When it's on top of a stack that someone claims.

ACTION IDEAS
* Lock a pile (to be unclaimable or un-growable)
* Get to your turn faster/make other people skip their turn
* Have extra rewards/bonuses for adding to/claiming a pile, to make you hesitate to do the "best move" and go for something else.
* See another player's cards / Steal a specific card (like asking them for their 5 or 6)
* Get rid of a previously claimed stack (if that was a mistake/forced on you); either by taking into hand, or putting back in center, or just destroying 100%.
* Mess with claiming order/when a "forced claim" happens?
* Allow bills of _different values_ in the _same stack_. (In that case, the "stack type" is whatever is on top?)
* TURN ORDER is absolutely crucial here, so find a way to change it with powers.

### Shopping Spree

TWO IDEAS here:
* Add PRODUCTS that people can BUY with the money they claimed. This gives a permanent big power---at the cost of a setback to yourself, of course.
* Or it might be between players. For example, you can buy cards/stacks from each other by negotiating or by giving them a hand card of equal value.

GREAT IDEA FOR PRODUCT TO BUY:
* More specific goals for yourself. (Such as "you only need 7 dollars, but can only claim 1 or 2 dollar bills") => because it's publicly bought, this is public information. But if done right, it's an advantage that allows you to win more quickly.
* Access to more cards/weirdly-numbered cards (-2, -1, 0, 6)

STUFF TO TWEAK (can overlap with actions to some extent):
* Different money values have different "max stacks". (For example, with 1-dollar bills, you already get an instant "claim" if it only has size 4?)
* Something with bluffing, or predicting, or keeping your money hidden, or getting information about hand cards?
