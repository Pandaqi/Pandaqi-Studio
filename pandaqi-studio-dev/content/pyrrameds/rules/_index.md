Separate the deck into MEDICINE and PATIENTS. Deal each player 2 of each type.

Then combine all cards into one deck.

* Place a row of 6 cards in the middle of the table. 
* Fairly deal the remaining cards over all players.
* (Any leftover cards are shown and discarded.)

The game **ends** as soon as a player's hand is empty. **They win.**

From start player, take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, either **PLACE** or **SWAP**. 

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Place" %}}

Placement happens following "pyramid" (or "staircase") rules, both _above_ and _below_ the starting row.

* Place cards _between_ those from the previous layer.
* Each layer contains one fewer card than the previous one.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

A MEDICINE card can only be placed if the numbers are right.

* Check the cards on the previous layer that "support" this card. (There must be 1 or 2. You can't place a card disconnected from the previous layer.)
* Your number must be _higher than all_ or _lower than all_.

A PATIENT card can only be placed if ... 

* There is a path through the pyramid, starting from the patient card
* Which passes through all required medicine (for this patient); nothing more and nothing less.
* And never travels backward. (You can't go up and then down again; or left and then right.)

Playing a patient is hard! And so you are rewarded.

> For each requirement on your patient, pick a player who must show you a hand card.

{{% rules-block heading="Swap" %}}

Swap two cards that are already in the pyramid. 

Some restrictions, however, apply.

* Reveal a hand card to all other players.
* If it's a patient, you can only swap cards of types they want.
* If it's medicine, one of the swapped cards must be of that type.

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! Try any of the expansions below.

{{% rules-block heading="Operations" %}}

This expansion adds **special cards**.

Their placement rules are the same as for medicine. Once placed, they instantly trigger their action (written on them).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Intensive Care" %}}

This expansion adds more **unique medicine and patients.**

It also adds **wildcards** (numbers, medicine, requirements that can be _any_ type you want).

Because of the increased deck size, also increase the starting row to 8 cards.
