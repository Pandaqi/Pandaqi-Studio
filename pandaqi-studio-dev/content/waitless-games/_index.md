{{% boardgame-intro heading="" %}}

A series of simple games you can play while waiting in line, or standing up, or any other unconventional situation.

{{% /boardgame-intro %}}

{{% section-centered heading="What's this?" %}}

This is the **overview page** of the Waitless Games.

Click any of the links below to visit a specific game. They aren't sorted in any particular way.

* [Creature Quellector](/waitless-games/play/creature-quellector/): design the best squad of creatures by winning or tactically losing battles against your opponent's hands.
* @TODO
  
All the games are unique: new rules, new art style, new material, new ideas.

Their one thing in common, though, is that they are **"waitless"**. Designed to be played in waiting rooms, queues, rooms without a table or chairs, etcetera.

* You can start or stop them incredibly quickly.
* Little material and all of it is held in hands at all times.
* Rounds are very fast, often even "simultaneous".
* You will not look silly or annoy others around you while playing.

_Great! When are new games added?_ Currently, I have ~6 ideas, of which ~2 new ones will be added each year.

It is not hard to guess where these ideas came from. Waiting in line at a theme park is never fun---why not play a game? I have, unfortunately, spent a lot of time waiting in the hospital, or living in a situation where a traditional game just can't be played. Is it really that hard to design (board) games you _could_ do in that moment?

And thus the journey started. It started with a game that ended up being simple and good, but not entirely Waitless: it needed too much setup and material for that. (I am talking about _Kingseat_, and have since moved these to the [Throneless Games](/throneless-games/) project.)

That "failed attempt", however, showed me what I did wrong and how I had to approach these games in a different way. Once I figured that out, the ideas and their feasibility improved. 

Because all games are completely unique in their gameplay, there are no shared images or fonts. For detailed credits, you'll have to check out the page for a specific game.

Some images were generated using AI. I generally use open source and free fonts, though I sometimes make one myself. Everything else---code, assets, ideas, rules, this website---is all mine.
