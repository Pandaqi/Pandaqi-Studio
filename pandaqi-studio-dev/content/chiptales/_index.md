## Background

Each of these ideas started because I played another game of poker and thought "surely we can find a better casual family game version than this?" 

I sought to keep the basic idea of scoring combinations (from hand cards) and betting/bluffing, but make it simpler, faster, more strategic, or simply more thematic. To keep the **spirit** of poker (or similar bluffing games), but in a more **family-friendly** and easy to setup package.

As such, all these games are wildly different and sometimes don't even resemble poker anymore!

I wrote a [longer article on my blog](https://tiamopastoor.com/blog/2025/02/my-problems-with-poker/) about what I like and dislike about poker. It explains the origin of a weird project like this. ("I hate this game---let's make six games like it!")

For the longest time, they weren't even a "collection". I only realized I could group them when I made my fourth game this way. When I have so many games with a common theme, I prefer to bundle them. It keeps the website more clean and helps people find similar games to what they like. 

(It also gives me a nice deadline to finish all games inside a project. Because as we all know: the final 10% of any creative project is harder than the first 90% :p)

## Credits

With these games, I vowed to **not** use any image generation AI. I barely use it in other games as it is, but I wanted to challenge myself and keep it out of this project completely. The fonts used for this main project page are **Klarissa** (headings) and **Cooper** (body). 

Everything else---code, assets, ideas, illustrations, general design---is mine. Check the specific games for the specific fonts used or other remarks.
