Draw a random card and place it face-up on the table. This is the "match" currently taking place. 

Deal the deck of cards until empty, as fairly as possible.

The player with the **highest bear card starts**.

You win if, at the **start of your turn**, the match on the table is **already yours**! <span class="inline-remark">(You played a match that nobody could defeat for a whole round.)</span>

Take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, do ONE of two things: **play a valid move** or **give away two cards**.

If you're out of cards (at the start of your turn), steal 4 cards from other players, in whatever way you want.

Cards have an animal and a number.

A "match" is simply the set of cards in the center of the table.

* The sport you're playing is determined by the **majority animal**: the animal that appears most often. (If tied, you play multiple sports at once!)
* How well you're doing is determined by the **sum of all numbers**.

To do a valid move, you must play a set of cards that ...

* **Changes the sport**. Provide another animal that occurs more often than the current majority animal. The total value doesn't matter.
* **Or plays the same sport, but better.** Play cards with the same majority animal, but with a total value that's higher.

Such a set may contain at most 5 cards.

Remove the previous match (cards) from the game. Ensure the new cards face you to remember you were the one who played them!

{{% rules-block id="gameplay_give_away" heading="Give Away" %}}

Give away **two hand cards**. (To the same player or two different players.) This happens _publicly_: everyone can see the cards.

Bears are both a **trump** and a **wildcard**. What does that mean?

* You can **always** raise the match by simply playing more bears. <span class="inline-remark">(Example: 2 tigers can be trumped by 1 bear, as that is more than 0 bears.)</span>
* On their own, bears are **any type you want**. When played in combination, they **become the majority animal(s)**. <span class="inline-remark">(Example: you play 2 tigers and 2 bears. Now there are 4 tigers on the table.)</span>

Bears are, however, also a liability. 

* You **cannot win with a bear in your hand**. <span class="inline-remark">(If you do, replace the current match with that bear. The first player after you who CAN play a valid move MUST do so now.)</span>
* You also cannot play non-bear cards that have the **same number as a bear** in your hand. <span class="inline-remark">(Not even if you play the bear as well in the same match!)</span>

{{% rules-block id="expansion" heading="Expansion" class="force-page-break-before" icon="expansion" icontint="lightblue" %}}

Played a few games and ready for a bigger challenge? Try the expansion(s)!

This game has 14 "expansion animals". You can swap regular animals for expansion animals however you like, as long as every game has the _bear_ in it!

These animals have an **action**. There are three types.

* ALWAYS: These are always active.
* WHEN PLAYED: These trigger when you play the card as part of a match.
* WHEN GIVEN: These trigger when you give away this card.

The actions are very simple and explained on the cards themselves. Have fun!
