Bready (pirate-like, thick, nice font) => free for personal use only (Dafont)

## What's This?

This is a board game (no device/app required during play), BUT all components are randomly generated beforehand!

Input any word you like below ("SPACE", "PIRATES", ...) and click "generate game"

This will create several images, containing a random universe, player ships and powers, cities, and more.

Print these and play the game!

**Remark:** you can also print all materials as a PDF! This will often be quicker and easier to download and print.

**Remark:** because it's randomly generated, there's a tiny probability that it generates a game that is clearly unfair or unbalanced. (Or it simply creates a game board that looks ugly.) 

So check if you like what you see, before you print!
