The fonts used are **Vadamecum** (headings) and **Josefin Slab** (body). Everything else is mine.

**This game can be played with a standard deck of cards.** Just read the rules and use numbers 1--10 of a standard deck. Decide which of the suits (hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds) maps to which of the suits in the game (floors, walls, stairs, roofs). And you're good to go!

This idea is a kind of "twin" of [Six of Sparrows](/six-of-sparrows/). The two were originally one, merged idea, which I split when I realized that would be far better and simpler to play.

That original idea came to me when I stumbled upon an older classic card game called Tichu. In it, players receive their cards "staggered": first you get X cards, then you may bid, then you get the rest of your cards. If you bid early, of course, you're rewarded with far more points---but it's risky, without knowing the other half of your cards!

I continued developing that idea, streamlining how scoring works, adding some more spice, until I ended up with a strong---if somewhat convoluted---idea. That's when I split it into two. 

* Bidding Blocks is all about _interaction between players_, while Six of Sparrows is more _individualized pattern matching_.
* Bidding Blocks is very simple to learn if you have _any_ experience with classic card games or trick-taking games. If not, Six of Sparrows might be easier to try first.

Pick whichever one you like best!
