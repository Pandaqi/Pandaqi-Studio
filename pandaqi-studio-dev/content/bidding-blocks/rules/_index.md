Three quick steps.

* Grab a pen and paper to keep score. 
* Create a single deck with all cards.
* Pick anyone to be the first Dealer.

The game works with quick rounds that you play over and over.

You can keep playing rounds as long as you like, but a recommended target is 500 points: if someone reaches that, they win.

Every round has three simple phases: **dealing**, **playing** and **scoring**.

{{% rules-block heading="Dealing" %}}

Repeat the following cycle until all players have 10 cards.

* Give all players a single card.
* Now players may **bid**. 
  * If they choose to do so, they must state a **number**: their guess for how many "challenges" they will win.
  * Write their bid on the paper _and_ how many cards they had when they made it: `BID / CARDS`
* Once you've bid, you can't change your mind. 

If the final card has been given, and you still haven't bid, then you must do so now.

{{% rules-block heading="Playing" %}}

Repeat the following cycle until all players are out of cards.

* The Dealer starts a new challenge: either **together** or **in-turn**.
* If **together**, everyone _simultaneously_ plays a facedown card. Once done, they're revealed at the same time.
  * Whoever played the _highest number_ of the _type_ that the Dealer played, wins the challenge.
* If **in-turn**, players go clockwise playing their card one after another. You may only play a card that fits _on top of_ the card of the previous player.
  * The Dealer, who starts each challenge, can play anything they want.
  * To fit "on top of" a card, it must be of a _higher type_ (e.g. roof is higher than wall) or _higher number_. (Every card states which types are below it.)
  * This continues until someone can't or doesn't want to play a card.
  * Whoever played the final card, wins this challenge. 

If you won the challenge, place the cards before you as a separate facedown pile. This helps easily track how many challenges you've won.

You become the next Dealer.

If you're out of cards, you simply get no turns anymore. (When it's your turn, the challenge doesn't "end" because you had no card---it just skips over you.) If you ever end up Dealer in this state, the role moves to the closest player _with cards_ to your left.

{{% rules-block id="scoring" heading="Scoring" icon="score" %}}

Once all challenges have been played, all players calculate their score!

* A player receives **100 points** for matching their bid perfectly. (That is, they won exactly as many challenges as they said they would.)
* A player receives **50 points** if they're off by one. 
* Any worse outcomes yield **0 points**.
* This point value is **divided by** how many cards they had when they made the bid.
* This number, rounded down, is your score!

FOR EXAMPLE: Someone bid 4 and won 3 tricks. They're off by one, so worth 50 points. They made their bid when they had 5 cards, so their score for this round is 50 / 5 = 10 points.
