Each player picks a specific cat to play. They receive their pile of 9 cards: your **lives**. Place them faceup in front of you, sorted from high to low.

Put all **number cards** into a deck, shuffle, then deal everyone 3 cards. 

Pick anyone to be the Kittyking.

The game ends when **a player runs out of lives**. The player with the most lives wins. (Ties are broken by hand size.)

Play happens in rounds. The Kittyking starts, then take clockwise turns.

@TODO: Interactive Example

{{% rules-block heading="On your turn" %}}

On your turn, you **play a number that isn't already on the table.** That's it.

Play it to the _left_ or the _right_ of the row on the table. If you match **suit** with the neighbor card, **draw 2 cards**.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE => show playing cards in a row and not playing forbidden numbers, show matching neighbor.

But what if you can't play a card?

Before taking your turn, you _may_ **wager a life**. 

* Place your top Life Card before you.
* Draw 1 card from the deck.
* And you're allowed to play multiple cards (a "stack") this round.

If you play a stack, the individual cards don't matter, only its **total**! _Add_ or _subtract_ the numbers on the cards---however you want---to get its final number. It can't be outside of the range 1 through 9.

All other rules remain. (The final number of your stack can't already be on the table; draw 2 cards for every neighbor card with a matching suit.)

{{% rules-block heading="End of Round" %}}

A round can end in two ways.

* If you fail to play something. If so, only you **lose a life**.
* If all numbers are played. In that case, **all players lose a life**.

Losing a life means you discard your top Life Card, _as well as all lives you wagered this round!_ (Otherwise, those Life Cards return to the top of your lives deck.)

Discard all cards played. 

The player with the **most hand cards** becomes the new Kittyking. If tied, pick the player with the most lives. If still tied, Kittyking doesn't change.

Each Life Card shows a **power** and **hand limit**. At any time, only the _top card_ from your deck applies to you.

* Whenever your top Life Card changes, try to read the power out loud for everyone to hear.
* If your hand limit is reached, you can't receive more cards.

The "9"-card has no power, only a useful reminder about the rules!

During the game, you may always browse through your lives to see what's coming up!

The game ends as soon as one player discarded their final Life Card. Have fun!

The base game rules are quite forgiving. Once you're familiar with the game, you might want a bigger challenge. Try using the variants below.

* You're also never allowed to play a number equal to the **number of cards on the table.** (Example: the current row has 3 cards. You can't play a card or stack worth 3.)
* Wagering a life allows you to draw 1 card OR allows playing a stack, never both.
* You cannot wager your first or last life.
* The "star" suit is special: it can only be played **once** per round.
* Before each round, the Kittyking proclaims one suit to be "bad". You can't play it outside of a stack, and only draw 1 card for matching with a neighbor.

Similarly, you can **shuffle** the life decks.
* You can do so _per cat_: the lives simply appear in a different order (not strictly high to low).
* Or with _all_ cards: your lives deck might have cards from a number of different cats!
