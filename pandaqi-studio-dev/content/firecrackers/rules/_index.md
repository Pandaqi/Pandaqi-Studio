Create the **deck** you'll use for this game.
* Include all the black cards.
* Include 1 colored set per player. 

Pick the 3 colors with which you want to start. Grab all their cards that have _no_ action. Now give every player their personal **starting deck**.
* Include 1 random card per starting color.
* And 2 random black cards.

Each player studies their deck, then shuffles it and places it facedown before them.

Finally, place the remaining cards faceup into the **shop**.
* Add one pile for all cards without an action. (The majority of them.)
* Add one pile _per color_ (with all remaining cards).

The most reckless player becomes Firemaster.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE => general deck, personal decks, grouped shops (where one pile is for all the "no action" cards, blacks are together)

The game ends after the round when the **shop runs out**. 

Players count their score by **summing the numbers** of all the cards inside their **deck**. Highest score wins!

Some cards have a special rule about their value. This _replaces_ their number, it's not added!

Play happens in rounds. Beginning with the Firemaster, take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, either **REVEAL** or **STOP**.

At any point, if your deck is empty, turn over and shuffle your discard pile to create your new deck. (You only permanently lose a card when an action uses the term "destroy".)

The round ends when all players are done. When that happens,
* The last player alive become the new Firemaster.
* All players move their revealed cards to their own faceup discard pile.

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Reveal" %}}

**Reveal the top card of your deck.** Your revealed cards form a faceup row next to your deck.

If the card has a special action, execute it now. If you can't, or it's not relevant now, simply ignore it.

Sum all numbers from revealed cards of the same **color**. If this total is 10 or higher, you **explode!** You're out of the round.

{{% rules-block heading="Stop" %}}

Say "I stop!" 

You're out of the round, but you may first **buy new cards** from the shop.

Each card you **revealed** this round is worth **1 coin** (unless stated otherwise). You may use the money any way you want, but leftover coins are lost.

Cards bought go to your _discard_ pile.

That's it. Have fun!

For extreme player counts, a slightly different setup is usually preferred.

**Playing with 2 players?** Include 2 colored sets per player in the deck. (So 4 sets in total.)

**Playing with 7(+) players?** When creating the personal starting decks,
* Use 4 unique starting colors
* And only 1 random black card.

You'll also be forced to use the action cards of each starting color.

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

**Want a shorter game?** Play until either all action cards are gone (from the shop), or all non-action cards are gone.

**Want a simpler and less luck-based game?** Remove or reduce the pile of Black cards. (Their purpose is to add useful actions and more cards of the same color, but this also leads to more complexity and a larger chance of exploding in that color.)

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Scoreworks" %}}

This expansion requires printing the Scoreworks cards. Each has a new rule for how you _score_ at the end of the game. 

Usually, this rule is added on top of the default rule (that each card simply scores its number at the end). Some, however, _replace_ that rule instead.

During setup, simply draw one **random card** from this deck.

It also adds **two** extra rules to the core gameplay.
* The **last player alive**, after stopping or exploding, may **destroy** 1 revealed or discarded card (of theirs).
* If you **can** purchase something, you **must**.
