Create the deck you'll use for this game.
* Include all the black cards.
* Include 1 colored set per player. 

{{% remark %}}
With 2 players, include 3 colored sets.
{{% /remark %}}

Pick the 3 colors with which you want to start and grab all their cards that have _no_ action. Now give every player their personal starting deck.
* Include 1 random card per starting color.
* And 2 random black cards.

{{% remark %}}
With 7+ players, use 4 unique starting colors and only 1 black card. Also use the action cards of each starting color.

Each player studies their deck, then shuffles it and places it facedown before them.

Finally, place the remaining cards in the **shop**. Create _faceup_ piles, grouped by _action_.

The most reckless player becomes Firemaster.

The game ends after the round when the **shop runs out**. Players count their score by **summing the numbers** of all the cards inside their **deck**. Highest score wins!

Play happens in rounds. Beginning with the Firemaster, take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, either **REVEAL** or **STOP**.

At the end of the round, all players add their revealed cards to their own faceup discard pile. If your deck is empty, turn over and shuffle your discard pile to create your new deck. (You only permanently lose a card when an action uses the term "destroy".)

The first player to explode is the new Firemaster. If nobody exploded, the last player alive is Firemaster.

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Reveal" %}}

**Reveal the top card of your deck.** Your revealed cards form a faceup row next to your deck.

{{% remark %}} 
No more cards in your deck? You can't take this action and _must_ stop.
{{% /remark %}}

If the card has a special action, execute it now. If you can't, or it's not relevant now, simply ignore it.

Sum all numbers from revealed cards of the same **color**. If this total is 10 or higher, you **explode!** You're out of the round.

{{% rules-block heading="Stop" %}}

Say "I stop!" 

You're out of the round, but you may first **buy new cards** from the shop.

Each card you **revealed** this round is worth **1 coin**. You may use the money any way you want, but leftover coins are lost.

Cards bought go to your _discard_ pile.

That's it. Have fun!
