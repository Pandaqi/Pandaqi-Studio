Create the **deck** you'll use for this game.
* Include all the black cards.
* Include 1 colored set per player. 

Pick the 3 colors with which you want to start. Grab all their cards that have _no_ action. Now give every player their personal **starting deck**.
* Include 1 random card per starting color.
* And 2 random black cards.

Each player studies their deck, then shuffles it and places it facedown before them.

Finally, place the remaining cards faceup into the **shop**.
* Add one pile for all black cards.
* Add one pile for all cards without an action. (The majority of them.)
* Group all remaining cards into piles by _action_. (Most actions in colored sets appear exactly twice.)

The most reckless player becomes Firemaster.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE => general deck, personal decks, grouped shops (where one pile is for all the "no action" cards, blacks are together)

The game ends after the round when the **shop runs out**. Players count their score by **summing the numbers** of all the cards inside their **deck**. Highest score wins!

Play happens in rounds. Beginning with the Firemaster, take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, either **REVEAL** or **STOP**.

The rounds ends when all players are done. When that happens,
* The last player alive become the new Firemaster.
* All players move their revealed cards to their own faceup discard pile.
* If your deck is empty, turn over and shuffle your discard pile to create your new deck. (You only permanently lose a card when an action uses the term "destroy".)

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Reveal" %}}

**Reveal the top card of your deck.** Your revealed cards form a faceup row next to your deck.

{{% remark %}} 
No more cards in your deck? You can't take this action and _must_ stop.
{{% /remark %}}

If the card has a special action, execute it now. If you can't, or it's not relevant now, simply ignore it.

Sum all numbers from revealed cards of the same **color**. If this total is 10 or higher, you **explode!** You're out of the round.

{{% rules-block heading="Stop" %}}

Say "I stop!" 

You're out of the round, but you may first **buy new cards** from the shop.

Each card you **revealed** this round is worth **1 coin**. You may use the money any way you want, but leftover coins are lost.

Cards bought go to your _discard_ pile.

If you're the **last player alive**, you may **destroy** one card from your discard pile. (This is a way to get rid of "bad" cards in your deck that you don't want anymore.)

That's it. Have fun!

**Playing with 2 players?** Include 2 colored sets per player in the deck.

**Playing with 7(+) players?** When creating the personal starting decks,
* Use 4 unique starting colors
* And only 1 random black card.

You'll also be forced to use the action cards of each starting color.

**Want a shorter game?** Play until either all action cards are gone (from the shop), or all non-action cards are gone.
