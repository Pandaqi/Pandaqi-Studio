Shuffle the deck. Place the top card open on the table: this represents the current **offer**.

Deal the remaining cards until the deck is empty.

By making the deck bigger/smaller you can control game length. If you remove cards, it's recommended to remove the _extreme numbers_ (highest/lowest), not just random ones.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE? => this includes the anatomy of a tile (bid number vs price tag value vs action)

The game ends as soon as **all players are out of cards**. Count the total price value of your score pile. The **highest score wins**!

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done. On your turn, either **add a card** or **declare an auction.**

@TODO: INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE?

{{% rules-block heading="Add a Card" %}}

Add a card from your hand to the **offer**. Place it next to the final offer card, building a row from left to right.

You may only add cards with a _higher number_ than the previous offer card.

If you can't or don't want to add a card, you must declare an auction instead.

{{% rules-block heading="Declare an Auction" %}}

All players secretly pick a card from their hand: their **bid**. Reveal simultaneously.

Now sort the the players from _highest bid_ to _lowest bid_. If **no bid** is higher than the highest offer card, or lower than the lowest offer card, the auction **inverts**: sort players from _lowest bid_ to _highest bid_.

Ask these questions until somebody decides to take the offer.

* Do you want this offer? Then take it. Add the cards to your score pile.
* You don't want it? Pay for the privilege to skip. **Discard** a random card from your score pile. Then **add** one card from your hand to the offer, anywhere you want.

<!--- @TODO: not sure about this exception/wrinkle: The card you add must have a *higher* number than your own bid. --->

If it comes to the last player---the one with the worst bid---they _must_ accept. If you can't pay to skip, you must also accept.

The winner picks one bid to start the **next offer**. All other bids return to the player's hands.

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! These expansions mostly add _more cards_ with unique numbers. (The game should never have two cards with the same number.)
