Print a game board and hand out pens. 

Each player picks one inventory at the edge of the board: that's where you'll track your collected Magnetmen.

Take clockwise turns. On your turn, if possible, you must **collect a square**.

* Pick a square that hasn't been collected yet.
* Cross it out
* Draw the icon in an empty slot in your inventory.

If your inventory is full, you can't take any more turns.

Here's the twist. The more often you possess a specific icon, the more you're _repelled_ by it.

* You have an icon **once**? You can't collect squares horizontally next to it.
* You have an icon **twice**? You can't collect squares horizontally and vertically next to it.
* You have an icon **thrice** (or more)? You can't collect _any_ square next to it (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).
