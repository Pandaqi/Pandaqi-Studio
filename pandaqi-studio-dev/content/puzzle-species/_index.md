This game is a kind of "twin game" with [Teamturns](/teamturns/). I started with a simple idea about combining cards. On your turn, you wouldn't play _one card_ (like in most games), but _two cards_ that combined in some way. If you play well, those cards make each other stronger. If not, you create a cursed combo and shoot yourself in the foot.

When I developed that idea a little further, though, I stumbled upon two different approaches. Two different directions in which to take the game. One would be more individual and free (you create combos from your _own cards_, and they can be bigger than 2 cards), and the other was more cooperative and restricted (you must combine with cards from _other players_, who are just as likely to help you as to annoy you).

As usual, I decided to split that one idea into _two completely separate games_. This game is from the first approach; Teamturns was the result of the second one.

Teamturns is a slightly shorter and easier game. This game has one or two more rules to learn, but gives more depth and a longer game in return.

Also, yes, Puzzle Species is a pun on Puzzle Pieces. I'm shocked how many people miss that pun and ask where on earth I got the idea to create cartoony puzzle piece creatures as the theme for a game ;)
