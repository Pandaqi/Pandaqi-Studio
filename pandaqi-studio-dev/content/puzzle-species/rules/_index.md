## Setup

Deal everyone X cards. Pick anyone to be start player.

## Objective

The game ends when a player's _Puzzlepile_ contains **10 cards**, or the **deck runs out**. (Whichever happens first.)

All players count their score from the cards inside their _Puzzlepile_. **Highest score wins.**

## Gameplay

Take clockwise turns from start player until done.

### On Your Turn

On your turn, you play a combination of **2 cards**. Their puzzle pieces must _fit_ inside each other.

If you can't do this, or don't want to, draw 2 more cards and end your turn.

After playing a combo, 

* Place it in front of you. (It can be attacked by other players later.)
* Then **attack another player** with it. If you have more STRENGTH than the HEALTH of another player's combo, it disappears. You score 1 of its cards (place it on top of your Puzzle Pile, faceup)---the other one is discarded.

### Cards

Every card has a puzzle piece (color + shape open at some side).

It also has **stats**.

* HEALTH = used for defense, making it harder for others to remove your cards.
* STRENGTH = used for attack, removing other player's cards + getting them for your own puzzle pile.
* CUTENESS = used for _scoring_ cards gained.
* MISCELLANEOUS (like ENERGY) = used for _special effects_ and anything else => EXPANSION ONLY?

By default, you simply _combine_ the stats of both cards to get the total stats of that combo.

But some cards have a special **effect/action** that talks about modifying the _stats of their buddies_. (Buddies = all puzzle pieces to which they're connected.)

### Scoring

When scoring, combinations matter too! As such, never (accidentally) change the order of your _Puzzle Pile_, and newly gained cards are always placed on top.

* Divide your _Puzzlepile_ into pairs of 2. (Top 2 cards, next 2 cards, next 2 cards, and so forth.)
* Every pair scores the total number of CUTENESS icons it has.
* (Any single cards or impossible pairs score nothing.)

## Upgrades

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

### Variants

This game has no official variants.

### Puzzle Giants

This adds puzzle pieces with multiple openings. It has some massive changes to the core gameplay.

* On your turn, you may play as many cards as you want, but at least 1.
* You can keep as many "open combos" in front of you as you want. (And, as such, add the cards you played to any of your open combos or start a new one.)

There are three important twists.

* When attacking, you can also attack unfinished combos. (@TODO: BUT WITH SOME EXTRA DIFFICULTY?)
* You can only **finish a single combo** in one turn (and thus only attack once, with that one combo).
* Any **unfinished combo** at the end of the game, however, scores its value as _negative points_.
