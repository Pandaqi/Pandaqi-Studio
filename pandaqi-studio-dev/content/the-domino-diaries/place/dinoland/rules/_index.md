Create the **Asteroid Deck:** pick 10 Asteroid Tiles (6 regular, 4 Egg Hatch), shuffle, and place faceup on the table.

Create a **Domino Deck:** grab all Domino tiles, shuffle, and place facedown on the table.

Deal every player a hand of **4 dominoes**. Each player also picks a **color** and receives all pawns of that type.

Finally, prepare the map.
* Place a random domino in the center of the table.
* Place one **Asteroid Crosshairs** tile to its left, and one above it, pointing to it.

The game ends when the **Asteroid Deck runs out**. Check the [impact of the asteroid](#asteroid), then calculate the [final scores](#scoring).

If playing **cooperative**, higher is better. If playing **competitive**, highest score wins.

From start player, take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, simply **play a domino from your hand** (and then refill your hand). You _may_ also **claim**: place a pawn inside any unclaimed Area (see [scoring](#scoring)).

Only two restrictions apply: the domino must be adjacent to the current map and can't overlap anything.

If needed, simply move the Asteroid Crosshairs backward to make space for the growing map.

Then take the action of each dinosaur on the tile (if it has one).

* **Brachiosaurus**: look at the next 5 Asteroid Tiles.
* **Triceratops**: move the Asteroid Crosshairs in the direction indicated by the arrow. If it moves off the map, it wraps around to the other side.
* **Velociraptor**: discard the top card of the asteroid deck.

@TODO: IMAGE EXAMPLE?

There is one special type of asteroid tile: the **Egg Hatcher**. When revealed, 

* Find all claimed eggs. (All egg icons inside an Area claimed by a player.)
* For each one, its owner must now hatch the egg. (Do so in clockwise order, starting from the current active player.)
* This means they place a domino from their hand _on top_ of the egg, which must show a dinosaur in the spot where the egg previously was. It is _optional_ to take the corresponding dinosaur action.
* If it's _possible_, you _must hatch_. Otherwise, nothing happens.

{{% rules-block id="scoring" heading="Scoring" icon="score" %}}

Let's define an **Area** as the largest possible group of connected tiles with the same terrain.

> Each Area scores its **size** (number of rectangles inside it) multiplied by the number of **dinosaurs** inside.

Each player only scores Areas that they have claimed ( = one of their Pawns is inside that area.)

It can happen that Areas _merge_ over time: two Areas that used to be separate, and were claimed, are connected at some point. This is fine! All owners score that Area, but any eggs inside will never hatch.

{{% rules-block id="asteroid" heading="Asteroid Impact" icon="action" %}}

When the Asteroid Deck runs out, the asteroid crashes into your map.

* It hits the location where both its crosshairs meet.
* That square and all 8 neighboring squares (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) are "destroyed".
* (The map does _not_ wrap like the crosshairs, which makes checking the impact far simpler.)
* If a square is destroyed, its entire **Area** (see [scoring](#scoring)) must be ignored when scoring.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

The "simpler" variants are great for a first game with very young kids, because they make the game extremely simple to teach and play.

**Variant (simpler):** remove all dominoes that show an Egg, and don't include any Egg Hatch asteroid tiles. The entire egg-hatching mechanic is simply excluded from the game.

**Variant (simpler):** reduce the range of the Asteroid to only the single square that it hits.

**Variant (simpler):** ignore the Brachiosaurus action ( = look ahead in the Asteroid Deck). This dinosaur simply has no action.

**Variant (duration):** to change the duration of the game, change the size of the Asteroid Deck. (As expected, bigger deck = longer game.)

**Variant (duration):** instantly end the game as soon as all players have placed all their Pawns.

**Variant (harder):** don't allow Herbivores and Carnivores to be in the same Area! 
* All dinosaurs in this game are Herbivores, except the Velociraptor (which brings the Asteroid closer). 
* This also restricts what the Wildcard Dinosaur (from the expansion) can be. That is, if you place a wildcard in an area with only Herbivores, then you can only make it be a Herbivore type. (And if inside an area with only Carnivores, it can only be a Velociraptor.)

**Variant (even harder):** don't allow more than 1 type of Dinosaur in the same Area!

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion" %}}

This expansion adds two more terrain types: desert and wildcard (which can be _any terrain_, or rather "all of them at the same time").

It also adds two more dinosaurs.
* **Stegosaurus** = look at another player's hand OR replace your entire hand with new dominoes from the deck
* **Wildcard** = represents any dinosaur type you want

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Impact Cards" %}}

This expansion adds a new deck: the Impact Cards. 

At the start of your game, draw a random card and place it faceup on the table. 

This card tells you **how** to handle the Asteroid Impact at the end of the game! (What gets destroyed and perhaps another rules tweak.)

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Special Asteroids" %}}

This expansion adds many more Asteroid Cards with special actions on them.

* During Setup, swap any regular Asteroid Tiles for _random ones_ from this expansion.
* During Gameplay, whenever you discard such a tile, execute its action!
* If the action must be done by someone, this is always the player who discarded the tile.
