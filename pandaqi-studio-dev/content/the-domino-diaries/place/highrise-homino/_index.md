The fonts used are **Grolear** (headings) and **Kanit** (body text). Some generative image AI was used. Everything else (code, idea, rules, illustrations) is entirely mine.

This game is perhaps the most "peaceful" of all the domino games. Yes, there's still a lot of interaction, and you can be mean to other players in small ways. But everyone has _their own little floor to manage_, instead of a shared map. And nobody can touch your floor! So you can place your dominoes in relative peace and just try to design a floor that the highest-scoring tenants want to visit.

By placing all players inside the same building, you can even piggyback. If the player on the floor below you builds a pool, you don't have to anymore: just build a staircase to them. I tried to use this experimental idea---everyone is a different floor in the same building---to make a really unique and fun domino game.

As always, have fun with it, and let me know what you think, both the good and the bad.
