For each Animal in the game, place its **Animal Tile** on the table. It contains details about each animal. Don't worry, most of it is _not_ used in the base game, but becomes more and more important in the expansions!

Place the **Entrance Tile** in the center of the table. 

Shuffle the deck and hand each player 6 Tiles. Each player also picks a color and receives all its Pawns.

Finally, place 6 Tiles faceup next to the deck: this is the **market**.

The game ends as soon as **all dominoes have been placed**. Everyone scores their claimed exhibits. **Highest score wins!**

From start player, take clockwise turns until done. 

Each turn has three simple steps (in this order): PLAY, CLAIM, DRAW.

First, two definitions.
* An **Area** is any group of connected tiles of the same terrain. (Paths are excluded; they're always considered "different terrain" than their neighbors.)
* An **Exhibit** is a group of connected areas that is completely **enclosed** (fences on all sides). 

{{% remark %}}
Yes, an exhibit can contain different terrains or be claimed by multiple players.

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

Place **1 or 2 dominoes**.

Dominoes come in two flavors: _with terrain_ ( = BOTTOM) and _without terrain_ ( = TOP).

* BOTTOM: Must be placed adjacent to the current map. It **can't** overlap an existing domino.
* TOP: **Must overlap** an existing domino.

When placing animals, there is only one rule: they must be placed on one of their **preferred terrains** (see their details tile).

Whenever someone **finishes an exhibit**, a **Feed Phase** triggers.
* Check all **claimed exhibits** that contain at least one animal. Its owner(s) must feed the animals inside!
* You do so by _discarding_ a domino that shows Food from inside the Exhibit. (You always discard only 1 food, regardless of how many animals there are.)
* If you **can't** feed them, _discard_ a domino showing an animal inside the Exhibit.
* If this exhibit has multiple players inside, they discuss and choose what they want to do. If no decision can be reached, the player who has the biggest area chooses, then the player closest to the one who triggered the feed phase.

{{% rules-block heading="Claim" %}}

You **may** claim an Area by placing your Pawn on it. Each Area can only be claimed once.

Finally, draw tiles from the market until your hand is full again. Refill the market from the deck as needed.

{{% rules-block id="scoring" heading="Scoring" icon="score" %}}

At the end of the game, each player scores the Exhibits they claimed.

* Determine the largest Area ( = the terrain type that occurs most often). Count how many tiles it has.
* Count how many animals are inside the entire Exhibit.
* Exhibit Score = #tiles x #animals

Played the base game and ready for more? Or want to tweak it a little to fit your group? Check out these variants and expansions!

<!---
ANIMAL TILE:

* Herbivore or carnivore?
* What is their preferred terrain?
* Superstrength (or not)?
* How much food do they need?
* Solitary or Herd?
* Some funny backstory or fact about them

--->

{{% rules-block heading="Strong Species" %}}

This expansion adds 1 new animal (Lion) and 1 extra type of fence ("Strong Fence").

All animals with the **Superstrength** ability can only be enclosed by _strong fences_. If you use the regular fence, their entire exhibit is considered invalid.

{{% rules-block heading="Wildlife Wishes" %}}

@TODO: Add a few more special tiles and possible wishes/improvements for animals? (Such as Toys, more specific decoration, etcetera)

It also uses a few more details from the Animal Tile:

* You **can't** mix Herbivores and Carnivores within the same Area or Exhibit.
* You **can't** mix Solitary and Herd animals in the same Area or Exhibit.
* An Area or Exhibit that contains only Herd animals can be claimed by multiple players.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Unnatural Utilities" %}}

This expansion adds stalls or utilities. These modify the value or possibilities in their area.

Some of them allow you to get more food/skirt your food responsibilities.

This allows the following rule:

* The amount of **food** you must pay during the "Feed Phase" changes: sum the food requirements of all animals inside, round down. That's how many Food icons must be discarded.
