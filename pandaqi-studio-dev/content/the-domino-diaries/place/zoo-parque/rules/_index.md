For each Animal in the game, place its **Passport** on the table. It contains details about each animal. Don't worry, most of it is _not_ used in the base game, but becomes more and more important in the expansions!

Place the **Entrance Tile** in the center of the table. 

Shuffle the deck and hand each player 6 Tiles. Each player also picks a color and receives all its Pawns.

Finally, place 6 Tiles faceup next to the deck: this is the **market**.

The game ends as soon as **all dominoes have been placed**. Everyone scores their claimed exhibits. **Highest score wins!**

From start player, take clockwise turns until done. 

Each turn has three simple steps (in this order): PLAY, CLAIM, DRAW.

First, two definitions.
* An **Area** is any group of connected tiles of the same terrain. (Paths are excluded; they're always considered "different terrain" than their neighbors.)
* An **Exhibit** is a group of connected areas that is completely **enclosed** (fences on all sides). 

{{% remark %}}
Yes, a single exhibit can contain different terrains, animals or players.

Place **1 or 2 dominoes**. If you can't place anything, put 2 dominoes from your hand back into the deck (randomly).

Dominoes come in two flavors. If at least one part of the domino has _no background_ ( = no terrain), it is a "TOP" tile. Otherwise, it's a "BOTTOM" tile.

* BOTTOM: Must be placed adjacent to the current map. It **can't** overlap an existing domino.
* TOP: **Must overlap** an existing domino.

Only two placement rules apply.

* When placing animals, they must be placed on one of their **preferred terrains** (see their Passport).
* Once an Area is claimed by a player, **only they** are allowed to overlap it (and thus change some part of it).

Whenever someone **finishes an exhibit**, a **Feed Phase** triggers.
* Check all **claimed exhibits** that contain at least one animal. Its owner(s) must feed the animals inside!
* You do so by _discarding_ a domino that shows Food from inside the Exhibit. (You always discard only 1 food, regardless of how many animals there are.)
* If you **can't** feed them, _discard_ the domino showing the most animals inside the Exhibit.
* If this exhibit has multiple players inside, they discuss and choose what they want to do. If no decision can be reached, the player who has the biggest area chooses, then the player closest to the one who triggered the feed phase.

You **may** claim an Area by placing your Pawn on it. Each Area can only be claimed once.

Finally, draw tiles from the market until your hand is full again. Refill the market from the deck as needed.

At the end of the game, each player scores the Exhibits they claimed.

* Determine the largest Area ( = the terrain type that occurs most often). Count how many tiles it has.
* Count how many animals are inside the entire Exhibit.
* Exhibit Score = #tiles x #animals
* Your score is _doubled_ if all animals inside the Exhibit are of the same type.

{{% rules-block heading="Variants & Expansions" icon="expansion" %}}

Played the base game and ready for more? Or want to tweak it a little to fit your group? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Strong Species" %}}

This expansion adds a few more animals and a new terrain.

It uses a new detail from the Animal Passport: **strong**.

> All animals that are **strong** can only be enclosed by _strong fences_. The regular fence simply does nothing for an area that contains a strong animal.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Wildlife Wishes" %}}

This expansion adds a few more animals, a new terrain, and **objects** (such as toys for the animals).

It also uses a few more details from the Animal Passport:

* You **can't** mix Herbivores and Carnivores within the same Area or Exhibit.
* You **can't** mix Solitary and Herd animals in the same Area or Exhibit.
* An Area that contains only Herd animals can be claimed by as many players as the number of unique animal types inside.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Unnatural Utilities" %}}

This expansion adds a few more animals, a new terrain, and **stalls** (or "utilities"). These modify the value or possibilities in their area.

The amount of **food** you must pay during the "Feed Phase" changes. 

* Sum the **food** requirements of all animals inside.
* Divide by 4. (Round the number.)
* That's how many Food icons must be discarded for this exhibit.

It also enables **animal powers**. 

* Some animals have a power written on their passport. By default, the power triggers once, at the moment this animal is _played_.
* (If it triggers at some other moment, this is stated.)
* These powers are only **activated** once a **research lab** has been played. (Before that moment, ignore powers entirely.)

Finally, it adds **Extinct Animals** (a stamp on their Passport). You **can't play** an extinct animal until a research lab has been played.
