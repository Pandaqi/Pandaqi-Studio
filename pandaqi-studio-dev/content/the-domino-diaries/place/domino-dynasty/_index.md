The fonts used are **Dumbledor** (headings) and **Libre Caslon Text** (body text). Some generative image AI was used. Everything else (code, idea, rules, illustrations) is entirely mine.

This is the "final boss" of the domino games, if you want. It's the longest, biggest, most strategical of them all. In a sense, I used all the lessons I learned and mechanics I already tested in the other games, and combined them into one big game (while sprinkling a few unique ideas in there).

Unsurprisingly, this one was the hardest to make and took the longest to finish. Also unsurprisingly, I would recommend trying one of the others first, especially if you've never played a game of mine or a domino-placement game before.

Yes, the rules of the base game are still very simple. However, because all players get their own unique _role_ in the empire, e.g. "you are the only one who handles our military matters", the game is very cooperative and interactive by default. This means that if some of the players have no clue what they're doing, it becomes pretty hard to play, because suddenly you have no military at all and nobody can fix that :p
