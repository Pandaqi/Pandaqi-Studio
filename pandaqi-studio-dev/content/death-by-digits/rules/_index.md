Multiply your _number of players_ by 3, and let's call this number X. Only include cards from 1 up to and including X. (Each card should appear 3 times.)

Then,
* Deal each player twice as many cards as the number of players
* Place 3 cards facedown to the side: this is the **Murder** you're trying to solve.
* Place any remaining cards facedown on the table: the (shared) **Evidence**.

In these rules, the **"Midnumber"** is defined as the middle number of your deck: X divided by 2, rounded.

At the end of your turn, you may say "I know the solution!" 

State the missing numbers that are the **Murder** (order is irrelevant), then check privately.
* If you're right, you win!
* If you're wrong, the game continues, but without you.

From start player, take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, either **guess a card** or **play a combo**.

If you're ever out of cards, immediately take any 3 cards from Evidence into your hand.

This action is the simplest, but don't underestimate its power.

* Pick another player. 
* Guess the _lowest_ or _highest_ card in their hand. 

If you're right, they give that card to you. If not, they simply say you're wrong and nothing happens.

Play a set of 1, 2 or 3 cards faceup to Evidence.
* **1 card?** Steal 3 random cards from other players. If someone has the same number, however, they MAY reveal it and say "Stop!" This prevents you from stealing anything. It must be called _before_ you state your victim(s).
* **2 cards?** If they combine to the "Midnumber" (if the numbers are added or subtracted), take 2 cards from Evidence.
* **3 cards?** If they're three of a kind ( = "all of the same number"), look at 1 of the murder cards.

All variants and expansions can be played with the exact same base material.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant" %}}

Currently, playing a combo that _does nothing_ ... just means nothing happens. The main variant of the game means adding a rule for what to do if you play a combo without consequences. 

Pick one of the ideas below.

* If your combo does nothing, _flip_ one card (faceup <-> facedown) from Evidence
* If your combo does nothing, privately _look at_ one facedown card from Evidence.
* The Evidence starts empty; those cards are simply a draw pile. If your combo does nothing, draw a new card from the draw pile.

During **setup**, also include (some of) the 6 special cards. These only appear _once_ and have a number below 1 or above 18.

The card itself tells you how it works. They generally allow more powerful actions or creative restrictions on how to conduct your investigation.
