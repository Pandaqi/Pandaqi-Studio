<div class="naivigation-shared-rule">
These rules are the shared rules that are true for all Naivigation games. They also include the explanations for expansions that you can tack onto any version of the game. Whenever another rulebook includes a shared rule, it will appear in a colored box like this one!
</div>

Create a 5x5 grid of map tiles. Place the vehicle somewhere. 

Combine the default **Vehicle Cards** with the specific Vehicle Cards for this game. Give each player 3 of these to hold in their hand.

Combine the default Health Cards and the specific Health Cards for this game. Shuffle and take out 5: this is your **Health Deck**.

Place 5 instruction tokens in a row. You'll place your vehicle cards underneath these each round.

Pick any start player.

You immediately win once you **visited the 5 special locations**. (What they look like or how to visit them depends on the game.) 

You immediately **lose** if your vehicle takes **too much damage**: your Health Deck is empty! (How you take damage also depends on the specific game.)

{{% rules-block id="action_play" heading="Gameplay" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

Play happens in rounds.

From the start player, take clockwise turns doing one thing: **play a Vehicle Card**.

> Add a card from your hand, facedown, to an empty spot on the row of instructions. (Then draw your hand back to the hand limit of 3.)

Continue until each instruction token has a card below it! Then, **reveal each instruction and execute it** (left to right), one at a time. This moves the vehicle. 

Whoever played into the first slot becomes the new start player. Discard the instructions and play the next round!

@TODO: IMAGE

By default, _no communication about the game is allowed._ You may only communicate about your cards or plans when the **"Discuss"** Vehicle Card is executed.

Whenever you **take damage**, reveal the top card of your Health Deck. These cards always have a _handicap_, such as restricting which Vehicle Cards you can play. All revealed handicaps must be followed at all times.

In other words, as you take more damage, you lose more and more control over the vehicle ...

{{% rules-block id="vehicle_cards" heading="Vehicle Cards" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

The shared material has only 2 possible vehicle cards.

**Discuss**: when executed, you may communicate general plans or strategies! You may, however, never explicitly reveal the cards you have in your hand or the cards you played this round. This continues until you decide to execute the next instruction.

**Speedup**: add or remove 1 Instruction Token. Start player decides. The number of instructions must always be between 3 and 8. 
* If this leaves a card hanging (its token removed), it's just not executed. 
* If this creates a new empty slot, the player who played the original card must play a card into the new slot.

{{% rules-block id="large_groups" heading="Playing with 6+ players" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

At high player counts, you split into **2 teams**. 

Each controls their own vehicle, with their own row of 5 instruction tokens. 

You **win the game** if 
* The opponent is total loss
* Or the game is over ( = all special locations collected), and they collected fewer than you.

The rules stay the same, except for the following changes.
* When evaluating instructions, you alternate between the two vehicles. (Card 1 team A, Card 1 team B, Card 2 team A, ...)
* Crashing into each other does 1 damage to both.

@TODO: IMAGE (Just to make clear what it looks like with 2 instruction rows, even teams, alternating turns, etc)

{{% rules-block id="variants" heading="Variants & Expansions" icon="expansion" icontint="red" %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

You can make the game **easier or harder** by changing with how much Health you start.

When playing with new players or young kids, consider **allowing discussion** at the end of each round. You're not allowed to explicitly state your cards, but may otherwise strategize or clarify rules when uncertain.

The "Action Tokens" expansion (see below) is also designed to make the game easier in most cases.

The best way, though, to keep the game challenging and varied, is by introducing new expansions once in a while.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Action Cards" %}}

These are vehicle cards with a **special action**. It's recommended to include 10 random action cards, not the entire deck.

At the start of the game, choose how you want to use them: either **public** or **mixed in**.

PUBLIC (simpler game): Place **one** of each action card faceup on the table, within reach of all players. At any time, you may grab such a card and execute its action immediately. After doing so, however, the card is discarded and its action can never be taken again.

MIXED-IN (harder game): Simply mix all these cards with the regular Vehicle Cards deck. Execute their action only when the card is **revealed**. 
* For most cards, this is simply when it is revealed while executing instructions. 
* Some cards tell you to play faceup, which means instant execution.
* If a choice must be made, the _start player_ must make it.



@IDEA: Fewer used = higher score? Or using more of them lowers your health or something? Some other consequence? Bad Actions and you must use all of them or you can't win?

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="GPS Cards" %}}

At the start of each round, draw a new GPS Card from the deck.

These cards show the current location of the vehicle and possible squares of the map it might visit this round.

* If you visit any of the highlighted red squares, you get the penalty listed on the card.
* If you visit any of the highlighted green squares, you get the bonus listed on the card.

@IDEA: Some special squares that give a slight power/rules change when that specific square is visited?

{{% rules-block heading="Time Deck" %}}

This expansion adds extra time pressure. This is especially useful if your group tries to drive a little too ... safely.

* During setup, place a facedown deck of **20 Time Cards**. (Randomly selected, shuffled.)
* After every round, remove 1 card. If the card has a special event, execute that now.
* If the deck runs out, you've lost the game.

Whenever you take damage, you can also choose to take a penalty of 3 Time Cards instead.

About the special events ...
* If the card has an **offer**, you may choose whether to take it or not.
* They always refer to the round you just played, **never** previous rounds or the next round.
