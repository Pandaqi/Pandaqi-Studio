<div class="naivigation-shared-rule">
These rules are the shared rules that are true for all Naivigation games. They also include the explanations for expansions that you can tack onto any version of the game. Whenever another rulebook includes a shared rule, it will appear in a colored box like this one!
</div>

Create a 5x5 grid of map tiles. Place the vehicle somewhere. 

Combine the default **Vehicle Cards** with the specific Vehicle Cards for this game. Give each player 3 of these to hold in their hand.

Combine the default Health Cards and the specific Health Cards for this game. Shuffle and take out 5: this is your **Health Deck**.

Place the 5 row tokens in order: you'll place your instructions underneath these each round.

You immediately win once you **visited the 5 special locations**. (What they look like or how to visit them depends on the game.) 

You immediately **lose** if your vehicle takes **too much damage**: your Health Deck is empty! (How you take damage also depends on the specific game.)

{{% rules-block id="action_play" heading="Gameplay" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

Play happens in rounds.

First, determine **start player**. Throw the compass in the air and see to which player it points (the most).

{{% remark %}}
Throwing things in the air and seeing how they land is how you randomize everything in Naivigation.
{{% /remark %}}

Then, from the start player, take clockwise turns doing one thing: **play a Vehicle Card**.

> Add a card from your hand, facedown, to an empty spot on the row of instructions. (Then draw your hand back to the hand limit of 3.)

At the end of the round, **reveal each instruction and execute it** (left to right), one at a time. This moves the vehicle. Then discard the instructions and play the next round!

@TODO: IMAGE

By default, _no communication about the game is allowed._ You may only communicate about your cards or plans when the **"Discuss"** Vehicle Card is executed. (Which is why it's recommended to always include it.)

Whenever you **take damage**, reveal the top card of your Health Deck. These cards always have a _handicap_, such as restricting which Vehicle Cards you can play. All revealed handicaps must be followed at all times.

In other words, as you take more damage, you lose more and more control over the vehicle ...

{{% rules-block id="large_groups" heading="Playing with 6+ players" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

At high player counts, you split into **2 teams**. 

Each controls their own vehicle. You win the game if the opponent is total loss _or_ they collected fewer special locations than you.

The rules stay the same, except for the following changes.
* When evaluating instructions, you alternate between the two vehicles. (Card 1 team A, Card 1 team B, Card 2 team A, ...)
* Crashing into each other does 1 damage to both.

@TODO: IMAGE (Just to make clear what it looks like with 2 instruction rows, even teams, alternating turns, etc)

{{% rules-block id="variants" heading="Variants & Expansions" icon="expansion" icontint="red" %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

You can make the game **easier or harder** by changing with how much Health you start.

When playing with new players or young kids, consider **allowing discussion** at the end of each round. You're not allowed to explicitly state your cards, but may otherwise strategize or clarify rules when uncertain.

The "Action Tokens" expansion (see below) is also designed to make the game easier in most cases.

The best way, though, to keep the game challenging and varied, is by introducing new expansions once in a while.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Action Tokens" %}}

These tokens represent a special power. Once per game, at any moment during your turn, you can grab one and use it. After using it, turn it facedown or put it away.

@IDEA: Fewer used = higher score? Or using more of them lowers your health or something? Some other consequence? Bad Actions and you must use all of them or you can't win?

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="GPS Cards" %}}

At the start of each round, draw a new GPS Card from the deck.

These cards show the current location of the vehicle and possible squares of the map it might visit.

* If you visit any of the highlighted red squares, you get the penalty listed on the card.
* If you visit any of the highlighted green squares, you get the bonus listed on the card.

@IDEA: Some special squares that give a slight power/rules change when that specific square is visited?

{{% rules-block heading="Time Deck" %}}

This expansion adds extra time pressure. This is especially useful if your group tries to drive a little too ... safely.

* During setup, place a facedown deck of **20 Time Cards**. (Randomly selected, shuffled.)
* After every round, remove 1 card. If the card has a special event, execute that now.
* If the deck runs out, you've lost the game.

Whenever you take damage, you can also choose to take a penalty of 3 Time Cards instead.

About the special events ...
* If the card has an **offer**, you may choose whether to take it or not.
* They always refer to the round you just played, **never** previous rounds or the next round.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Fuel Deck" %}}

@TODO: This might not be a shared one, as some games actually have this mechanic _built-in_. (And to do it well, it would need to be _on the cards_ or something.)

This expansion adds a constant extra pressure or decision to the game. Its rules are simple as always, but it makes the game considerably harder, so ye be warned.

During setup, 
* Place the **10 Fuel Cards** on the table.
* Include the **Refuel** Vehicle Cards.

During gameplay,
* For each Vehicle Card that _changes_ the vehicle (in whatever way), remove 1 Fuel.
* Each Refuel card adds fuel cards back to the deck. (How many depends on the number shown on the card.)

If you **run out of fuel**, or you **overfill** ( = more then 10 fuel), 
* All remaining instructions in the round are ignored
* You take 1 damage
* And your fuel tank is set to 5.
