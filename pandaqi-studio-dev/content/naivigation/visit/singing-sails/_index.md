This game is part of the Naivigation universe. It means you need two things to play this game.

* The Core Set from [Naivigation](/naivigation/) (which you need for all games).
* And the specific material for _this_ game. ("Download" > Core Set.)

Print and cut it, read the short [playful rules](rules), and you can play!

**Playful Rules?** It means you can press a button to get random examples of turns and setup, which is far more useful (and fun) than reading some text! I've been creating such rules for years now to great success.

**Want more?** You can also [generate your own material](#material) right on this website, to suit your specific needs.

This project is the "middle game" of the 5 major Naivigation games. And you can probably guess why. It's slightly more involved than the starter games, because of how wind direction and strength must move your ship. But it's still very simple, because a ship is quite free to move in the water, and everyone intuitively knows it can't move over land.

In return for a few more rules, you get a more fluid and creative game, where the ocean map is built as you go. The expansions are certainly recommended too, adding fun elements like pirate ships, treasures and water currents.
