This game is part of the Naivigation universe. It means you need two things to play this game.

* The Core Set from [Naivigation](/naivigation/) (which you need for all games).
* And the specific material for _this_ game. ("Download" > Core Set.)

Print and cut it, read the short [playful rules](rules), and you can play!

**Playful Rules?** It means you can press a button to get random examples of turns and setup, which is far more useful (and fun) than reading some text! I've been creating such rules for years now to great success.

**Want more?** You can also [generate your own material](#material) right on this website, to suit your specific needs.

This version is generally recommended as the "second version". It has more rules than the other "flying" vehicle---the spaceship---but not many. The biggest change is that height differences matter now and you need to actually land your airplane on solid ground sometimes.

The core game is extremely simple, because I moved all my crazy ideas to expansions. I think it's worth it to try all of them---not at the same time, of course---as they all push the game in very different directions.
