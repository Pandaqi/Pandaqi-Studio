Press the button below to get a random setup you can simply copy to your table.

{{< rules-example id="naivigation-setup" >}}

Alternatvely, manually do the setup as follows.
* Create a deck of 25 tiles, including 5 planets and 1 starting tile. 
* Randomly place these in a 5x5 grid. 
* Place the vehicle on the starting tile (oriented randomly)

<div class="naivigation-shared-rule">
Combine the default Vehicle Cards with the specific Vehicle Cards for this game. Shuffle and place as a FACEUP draw pile. Each player draws 3 of these to hold in their hand. 

Combine the default Health Cards and the specific Health Cards for this game. Shuffle and take out 5: this is your Health Deck.

Place 5 instruction tokens in a row. You'll place your vehicle cards underneath these each round. Pick any start player.

OLD SETUP
Alternatively, manually do the setup as follows.
* Create 5 piles of 4 tiles each without planets. 
* Then add exactly 1 planet inside each pile and shuffle. 
* Place them in a 5x5 grid (each pile being one row). 
* Place the spaceship on the first non-planet tile, in a random orientation. 
* (This is for map diversity. If planets are still bunched up in groups, simply redo this setup.)

You win once you've visited **5 planets**. You lose immediately once you're total loss: your **health deck is empty**.

Skip "Rounds & Turns" if you already know how to play Naivigation. The other section has unique rules for this game.

{{< rules-example id="naivigation-turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Rounds & Turns" class="naivigation-shared-rule-block" %}}

Play happens in rounds.

From the start player, take clockwise turns doing one thing: **play a Vehicle Card**.

> Add a card from your hand, facedown, to an empty spot on the row of instructions. (Then draw a new card.)

Continue until each instruction token has a card below it! Then, **reveal each instruction and execute it** (left to right), one at a time. This moves the vehicle. 

Whoever played into the first slot becomes the new start player. Discard the instructions and play the next round!

_No communication about the game is allowed._

Whenever you **take damage**, reveal the top card of your Health Deck. These cards always have a _handicap_, which must all be followed at all times.

{{% rules-block heading="Moving & Visiting" %}}

You can only **visit a planet** if the spaceship has the **same orientation** as indicated. 
* If it's wrong, you just stay where you are and take 1 damage.
* If correct, replace the planet with a random tile from the deck. You've visited it!

The map **wraps around**: flying off of one side makes you reappear on the other. Doing this, however, incurs 1 damage.

Whenever you move **diagonally**, you must choose which of the two directions (horizontally or vertically) you want to take. Actual diagonal movement doesn't exist.

In the base game, just ignore any special elements on tiles. They are for the expansions. That's it!

The following vehicle cards are in the base game.

* **Thrust**: Move one tile forward, in the direction the spaceship currently faces.
* **Steer:** The steering cards show a **range**. You may pick any angle (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) within that range.
  * Remember this is steering, so rotate the vehicle starting from its current direction. (Don't just snap to the angle indicated.)
* **Disable.** Perform one gravitational pull step.
	* Find the closest planet. (If tied, pick one.)
	* Move one tile closer to that planet.

{{% rules-block id="expansions" heading="Expansions" icon="expansion" icontint="red" %}}

It's recommended to add these expansions in order, as they get progressively harder, but not required. None of them change rules, they merely add more tiles (for the map) and vehicle cards (to play).

{{% rules-block heading="Shields & Asteroids" %}}

Add the following map tiles.
* **Asteroids:** if you fly into this tile, take 1 damage.
* **Wormhole:** teleport to another wormhole, take 1 damage.

Add the following vehicle cards.
* **Shield**: Toggles the shield on and off. When the shield is on, you don't take damage.
	* When on, place this card faceup on the table to remember this. (When the shield turns off, just remove this card.)
	* A **Disable** card ALSO turns off the shield.
* **Thrust+**: Moves 2 spaces at once. (Ignore the space you pass by; you simply skip over it.)

{{% rules-block heading="Weapons & Aliens" %}}

First, we define **line of sight**. A spaceship can "see" all non-empty tiles in front of their nose. Here, non-empty means it's either a special tile or it contains a spaceship.

Add the following map tiles.
* **Sun**: flying into this tile incurs 3 damage. It _also_ counts for gravitational pull (when playing a Disable card).
* **Enemy Spaceship**: Take 1 damage if you enter their line of sight or enter their tile. Then _rotate_ the spaceship to any different orientation.

Add the following vehicle card.
* **Shoot**: destroys the _first_ tile within line of sight. 
  * If this is a planet, you immediately lost the game! 
  * If this tile contained another spaceship (when playing with two teams), they take 2 damage.

{{% rules-block heading="Trade & Technology" %}}

Include the special **planet** and **planet properties** cards. Place the planet cards in a row. Then place two random property cards underneath each planet. 

There are two types of properties:
* **Collectable if**: this means you can ONLY collect this planet if you satisfy the given requirement(s)
* **Reward if**: this means you get some reward or penalty for visiting the planet in a certain way. 

When visiting a planet successfully, remove its card (and its properties) from this row.

Add the following map tiles.
* **Space Station**: enter this tile to repair 2 damage. Then remove the tile and replace with the top one from the deck.
* **Moon**: when visiting, collect this tile and replace with a new one from the deck. You may also  _rearrange_ the planets or planet properties.

If you have a planet property requiring a resource, make sure that resource is actually part of the map.

Add the following vehicle cards
* **Hyper**: move to one edge of the map ( = one end of your row or column)
