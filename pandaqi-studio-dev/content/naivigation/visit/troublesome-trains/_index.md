This game is part of the Naivigation universe. It means you need two things to play this game.

* The Core Set from [Naivigation](/naivigation/) (which you need for all games).
* And the specific material for _this_ game. ("Download" > Core Set.)

Print and cut it, read the short [playful rules](rules), and you can play!

**Playful Rules?** It means you can press a button to get random examples of turns and setup, which is far more useful (and fun) than reading some text! I've been creating such rules for years now to great success.

**Want more?** You can also [generate your own material](#material) right on this website, to suit your specific needs.

This game is the most unique of all the major Naivigation games, and it makes the largest tweaks to the core rules. That's the only reason why I placed it as the "hardest" of them all.

The rules of this game are actually very simple, even shorter than those of other Naivigation games. But you're not steering _a single train_ together, no, you're actually controlling _the rails_ (over which multiple trains move). This shift in mechanics and mind-set is natural to some, but a bit harder to grasp for others.

I think this version provides the biggest _logical puzzle_ of them all. Some situations can cause some real crunching of brains, and the fact you have to cooperate and guess each other's moves takes a bit of a backseat. (While this is a staple of most Naivigation games!) With multiple trains, after all, players can often do their own thing without interference.

This makes it the ideal Naivigation game for some, and certainly _not_ the ideal one for other groups. I still wanted to make and include it for variety and for those that love trains. Because of the unique core loop, it also has fewer and smaller expansions than the other games.
