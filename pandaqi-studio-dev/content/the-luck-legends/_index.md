This is the **overview page** of the The Luck Legends.

Click any of the links below to visit a specific game. They are roughly sorted based on simplicity.

{{< boardgame-project-games-list subdir="roll" >}}

All the games are completely unique experiences, with their own art, rules, ideas, and more.

The single thing they share is the same **core mechanic** I invented. I've dubbed it the **Dice Deck**. The idea is simple:

> All "dice" in these games are represented by decks of cards. You can "roll the die" by shuffling this deck and then revealing the top card. 

This is great! It allows the games to be easily print-n-play, as opposed to having to print and cut dice (which is never a fun experience). It also opens up millions of unique game ideas where you customize your die (by adding/removing cards), pick how you want to roll the die (by splitting your deck or only drawing from bottom), and more.

The fonts used are **Lost (Leonest)** for headings and **Effloresce** for body text. Some generative AI was used for illustrations in some of the games. Everything else---code, ideas, graphics, rules, etcetera---is entirely mine.

I've always wanted to include more dice or otherwise "random" mechanics into my games. There's a reason why a huge chunk of games include such aspects.

This was impossible, however, if I wanted to keep the games as accessible and easy to play as possible. It's just a very bad experience to cut dice from paper and glue them together. Similarly, I don't want to require people to have other very specific stuff at home (such as "you need 8 dice in two colors") before they can play my games.

As I wondered about these constraints and how to solve them, I realized this ingenious solution: just use _cards_ to simulate _dice rolls_.

I saw so much potential in this idea that I wrote down ~10 valid game ideas with it the same day. A few weeks later, I had time to work on the first few, and this project was born.
