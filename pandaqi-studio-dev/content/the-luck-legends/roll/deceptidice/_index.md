The fonts used are **XX** (headings) and **YY** (body text). Everything else is mine.

This idea spun off from an earlier Luck Legends game called _A Little White Die_. Both are based on the famous classic _Liar's Dice_. That other game is the most basic, simplest version of it. This game takes it into a more unique direction by combining bluffing and secret dice rolls with combinations that score higher and higher. Similar to poker hands, but simpler and more creative.

I basically developed it side-by-side with its twin game, knowing that merging the ideas would just be a convoluted mess. On their own, these are two simple but really effective games!

After playing 1 or 2 games, I highly recommend playing with the "Extra Deception" variant. It adds a ton of extra tactics and interesting guesses, but I moved it out of the base game to keep your first game as simple as possible.
