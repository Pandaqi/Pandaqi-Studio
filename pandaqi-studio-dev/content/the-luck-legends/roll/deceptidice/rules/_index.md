Deal all players a random deck of **9 Cards**. Keep the remaining cards to the side as a facedown draw pile.

Pick anyone to be the start player ("Liar").

The game ends as soon as somebody has only 3 cards left. Rank players based on how many cards they have left; more is better.

Gameplay happens in simultaneous rounds.

First, all players divide their deck into **3 decks** ("3 dice") as fairly as possible, without looking.

Then, everyone simultaneously rolls their 3 dice. That is, shuffle every pile and secretly look at the card on top.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

Starting from the Liar, in clockwise turns, players must now **guess** what's on the table. This includes _all_ dice, not just their own.

A guess has three elements.

* You say _how many_ cards are in your combo.
* You say whether your combo looks at _numbers_ or _colors_.
* You say whether they're the _same_ or in _order_ (only available for numbers).

For example, a guess might be "2 cards of the same color", or "3 cards in numeric order", or "4 cards of the same number".

Crucially, you must always **guess higher** than the previous player. This means your first number---how many cards---must be higher. The other two properties can be whatever you need.

If you don't want to do that, you **challenge** the previous guess and call their bluff.
* Reveal all the top cards of all the dice. Check if the previous guess was correct: _at least_ their guessed combo must appear on the table.
* If so, you were wrong and **you lose**. If not, then your challenge was correct, and the **player before you loses**. 

The loser of a round **discards** one of their cards (faceup).

They become the new Liar. Play the next round!

To make the game **even more tactical**, add a fourth element to your guess. This element is optional.

> State the **specific** suit or number for your combo. For _numeric_ guesses, state just one of the numbers inside the interval.

For example, "3 cards of Red", or "4 cards with the number 9", or "5 cards in numeric order including the number 6."

A specific guess is **always higher** than a vague one (without this fourth element). For example, "3 Cards with Number 2" is higher than "6 Cards of the same Number".

{{% remark %}}
So yes, once somebody goes specific, you can never go back to vague!
{{% /remark %}}

If the previous guess was also specific, the usual rules apply: your number (for how many of them) must simply be higher. FOr example, "3 Cards with Number 2" is higher than "2 Cards of Blue".

To actually **use all possible cards** (instead of just the once with which players start), add the following rule:

> The **losing player** of a round _may_ also **swap** one of their cards with one from the draw pile. 

If you have a very high player count---the draw pile is basically empty---you can replace this with allowing the loser to swap with _another player_.

To make the game **more predictable**, 
* During setup, have everyone _show_ their starting cards to the rest of the table.
* During gameplay, on your turn, you must reveal 1 of your secret dice (which you haven't revealed yet this round).

{{% rules-block heading="Wildcards" %}}

This expansion adds a tiny bit of extra material: Wildcards. 

These cards always match the current guess that's being challenged.

* If the combo was based on _numbers_, then every wildcard is the number you want.
* If the combo was based on _colors_, then every wildcard is the color you want.

{{% rules-block heading="Power Cards" %}}

This expansion adds more material: Power Cards.

These cards show a unique **combo** (that you would never be able to guess otherwise).

* If you roll this card, you're allowed to guess this specific combo.
* When you do, explain the combo and state its unique value.
* Other guesses are only **higher** if ...
  * They're also a Power Card with a **higher value**.
  * Or the **number of cards** in your guess is higher than the stated combo value.

For example, 
* A power card might say "two pairs". That is, two numbers that appear two times. And say the value of that card is 3.
* Then other players can bid HIGHER by saying ...
  * "I have a Power Card with value X", where X is higher than 3.
  * Or "My combo has X cards with ..." where X is higher than 3.

You are allowed to _lie_ about having a power card, making up some random combination and value. If challenged on this, you _always lose_.
