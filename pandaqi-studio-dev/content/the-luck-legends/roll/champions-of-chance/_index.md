The fonts used are **Luckiest Guy** (headings) and **Nunito Sans** (body text). Yes, I chose that first font because of how the name fit the game. Everything else is mine.

When I came up with the idea for the Luck Legends, I obviously wanted to start with the _simplest_ idea. The absolute simplest version of using dice for a game, which would allow me to test my "dice decks" mechanic and effortlessly introduce new people to these games.

The issue, of course, is that most dice games favor high numbers or other specific patterns. If you get lucky with the draw, your starting hand will be high numbers and you will ... probably easily win the game, and be bored while doing it. Because these games use a random _deck_ of six cards to simulate dice, instead of an actual die, this is an extra problem I need to solve.

This game was born from those considerations. What if you would _challenge_ another player to a dice battle, but you can _choose_ whether highest or lowest wins? This means you can adapt your random challenges based on your cards, and low numbers are equally likely to win as high ones.

This already worked great. Then I combined it with the simple fact that we can now easily _customize_ our dice---for example, if you pick only 3 of your 6 cards and "roll" those, you suddenly have completely different probabilities for which numbers would appear! This sealed the deal and made this game a very simple but fun and strategic entry to the Luck Legends.
