Everyone receives a random set of **6 cards**. (These are numbered 1--6.) This deck is your **"die"**.

Place the remaining cards as a facedown draw pile.

The game ends when a player is **out of cards**. That player wins!

On your turn, you do a **battle**.

* Pick the **opponent**: any other player.
* The opponent picks a **number**: anything between 2 and 6. Both battlers make their die as large as the _number_ stated. 
* Finally, you pick the **challenge**: either _lowest_ or _highest_.

_What does it mean to make your "die as large as X"?_ For example, if the opponent said "3", then both players only select 3 cards from their deck as their "die" this round. You may see and choose the cards you select.

If you can't meet the number, simply use your entire deck.

Both battlers "roll their die": shuffle the selected cards and reveal one at random.

* If your challenge was "highest", the highest result wins. 
* If your challenge was "lowest", the lowest result wins.

The **winner** of the battle discards the revealed card. (The loser just gets their card back.)

If it's a **tie**, both players discard 1 card of choice and draw a new one from the deck.

That's all! Have fun!

To make the game **harder and more random**, make creating your die **blind**. Players can't pick and choose the cards they select.

For a softer version of that, make picking _blind_, but allow players to _see_ their final die before picking the challenge (and rolling).

This expansion requires _no_ extra material.

Notice that all cards also have a number of _dice icons_ on them. (The middle numbers usually have more of them than the lowest or highest numbers.)

The following **gameplay** rules change.

* The winner of a battle doesn't discard their revealed card. Instead, they place cards won in a faceup pile before them.
* On your turn, you _may_ take away the opponent's right to pick the number. If you do so, the number of icons on your top faceup card determines the **number** for that battle. If you lose the battle now, you also lose that faceup card.

The following **objective** rules change.
* The game ends as soon as all players but one are out of cards. 
* Each player determines their score: count all dice icons in their faceup pile. Highest number wins!

VARIANT: In case of a tie, check the number of dice icons on the cards, and apply the challenge to those? (Would require pretty major randomization on those icons, which is probably not great.)

{{% rules-block heading="Wacky Numbers" %}}

This introduces cards with a **special action** besides having a number. These actions trigger when the battle is over and you're checking who won, unless stated otherwise.

* INVERT: Inverts the challenge. (Lowest <-> highest.)
* TIEBREAK: If it's a tie, you win and the other player loses.
* STEAL: Steal one card of choice from the selected cards of the opponent.
* BEGGAR: If the other player rolled a 1 or 6, you win.
* NUMBERLESS: Nothing happens after the battle, but this card is discarded.

In situations where both players "win" or both "lose" because of special actions, it's considered a **tie**.

If your die size in a battle is 1, you're **not** allowed to include a special card. (Unless you have no other choice.)
