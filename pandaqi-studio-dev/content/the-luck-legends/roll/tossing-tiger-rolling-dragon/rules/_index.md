Deal all players a random deck of **6 cards**. Place all remaining cards to the side as a facedown draw pile.

The game **ends** when a player has **fewer than 2 cards left**. Whoever has the **most cards** at that moment wins!

From start player, take clockwise turns. On your turn you always **wage war** against another player.

* Pick another player to fight.
* Say a **number**. That's how many piles (or "dice") both fighters must create out of their deck. 
* Every pile must have at least 2 cards, and you can't pick a number you or your opponent can't legally follow.

Once those piles are created, place them in pairs (one against one) on the table, in two rows. Every single pair is called a "battle"; the entire turn is called a "war".

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

For every pair, from left to right, 

* **Roll the dice**. Shuffle the two piles and reveal the top cards.
* Some cards have special actions. Handle those now. (If they require a choice, its player makes that choice now.)
* Check who won this battle. 
  * If one card is _strong_ against the other, it wins.
  * If the cards are the same _or_ none is strong/weak against the other, both players win.

This continues until all battles have been fought. Then, both players get their spoils of war.

* For every **battle you've won**, grab 1 card from the opponent's pile (inside that battle).
* If you **won the war**---you won the majority of battles---you grab the _entire pile_ from one of your won battles. (If it's a tie, nobody wins.)

For all cards grabbed, decide if you want to take them into your hand or discard them.

{{% remark %}}
Yes, you should wait with grabbing your spoils until the _war is over_. Because special powers can still change things at any time.

POSSIBLE ACTIONS:

* The **dragon** allows a re-roll (at most once). => a re-roll of just this battle, or any single one of your choosing? A re-roll of just _you_ or both you and the opponent?
* The **tiger** is effectively a coin toss => it means you toss the card into the air; if it lands faceup, you win, facedown, the opponent wins.
* "Remove all weaknesses from card X" (only you? Or opponent too? Both are interesting ...)
* "The opponent loses every battle where both players played the same card."
* CHOICE: "You _may_ retreat from the next battle; skip over it and pretend it's not part of this war."
* CHOICE: "You _may_ lose this battle to pretend you won an earlier one."
* CHOICE: "You _may_ lose this battle to add this card as a weakness to all opponent cards."
* CHOICE: "Swap two of your cards that have already been revealed."
* CHOICE: "You _may_ lose this battle to remove the bonus for winning the entire war."
* CHOICE: "Change the bonus for winning the entire war: either 0, 2, 3 or 4 entire piles."
* CHOICE: "Pick a card type. From now on, any such card you reveal has no weaknesses."
* CHOICE: "Pick a card type. From now on, any such card you reveal cannot lose a battle."
* CHOICE: "Always loses. Reroll another battle."
* CHOICE: "Take 1 or 2 unrevealed cards from your dice back into your hand."
* CHOICE: "You _may_ give this pile to your opponent to stop the war right now, declaring no winner."
* CHOICE: "You _may_ give this card to the opponent to restart the entire war." (perhaps too slow/cyclic?)
* CHOICE: "Force the opponent to merge two piles and re-roll. (You always win the battle against an empty spot.)"

@TODO: Bring it back to just 10 animals, which also makes the weaknesses manageable.


INTERESTING CARDS:
* Ones that will always LOSE, but give you an action during the battle (or afterwards)
* Ones that will always WIN, but give you some big curse during the battle (or afterwards)
* => We might need ones that can DRAW from the deck too?

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Highscore" %}}

For a **deeper and more tactical game**, change the rules for who wins the game.

* The number of **weaknesses** on a card is its _value_ (in victory points). 
* At the end of the game, every player sums the points of every card in their hand. 
* Highest score wins!

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Fight Together" %}}

In this expansion, all players are involved in every single war. (This might be a good idea if players find it hard to stay engaged when it's not their turn to wage a war.)

During **setup**, break the players into two teams as fairly as possible: A and B.

The **objective** changes as follows.
* After every war, the loser must place one card to the side. (If nobody wins, both are losers.)
* Once this "war pile" has 10 cards, the game ends. The team with the most cards (combined) wins.
* If a player ever has 2 cards or fewer, the game also ends, and that player's team loses.

During **gameplay**,
* Every round is a battle between these two teams. 
* The "attacker" alternates between Team A and Team B.

The biggest change is in how dice/piles are created at the start of a war.

* The current attacker states a **number** (of dice), as usual. 
* This number must be greater than the number of players on their team.
* Every team member must supply at least one _die_. (Who delivers any leftover dice is up for discussion within the team.)
* Every die must contain at least 3 cards, but there's no maximum size.

Then the game continues as normal: place piles, reveal, execute the war. If there's a choice to be made, the player who supplied that pile makes it.

Finally, any cards grabbed are divided amongst the team members however they like

**Communication is restricted.** Team members can't tell each other the cards in their hand or dice. They can only literally say what they want: "I want to be the second pile", or "I am fine with supplying 2 dice", or "I want that and that card from the spoils of war". (This includes, of course, affirming they understand the plan or will do as promised.)

The only new material you need is a small set of **communication cards**.

* If revealed in battle, they allow you to communicate freely about this war, until the next card is revealed. (You may say what's in your dice, or what you think another player should do, what you expect to happen and how the team should combat that. Anything except your hand cards.)
* But it always _loses_ its current battle.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Dawndojo" %}}

This expansion adds cards with a "Dawn" symbol and action. 

How to use them?

* On your turn, when creating your dice, you _may_ play such a card.
* Place it faceup in the position of the first pile (_instead_ of creating a pile for it).
* Its rule will be true for the entire war that follows. (This is usually a restriction on what can be played or done.)

In battle, such a card will _always lose_.
