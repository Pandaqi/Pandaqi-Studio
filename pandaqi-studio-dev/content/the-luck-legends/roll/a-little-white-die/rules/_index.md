Deal all players a deck of cards numbered 1--6. Keep the remaining cards to the side as a facedown draw pile.

Pick anyone to be the start player ("Liar").

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

For a **quick, light** game, stop playing when one player is out of cards. The player who has the most cards wins.

For a **longer, more tactical** game, keep playing until only one player has cards left. They win.

Gameplay happens in simultaneous rounds.

First, the Liar **states a number** greater than 1. 
* Everyone must **divide** their deck of cards into that many piles, or so-called "dice".
* You **can't** have dice of only a **single card**, unless you have no other choice.
* You **can't look** at the cards inside each dice.

Then everyone rolls their dice: shuffle every pile and secretly look at the card on top.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

Starting from the Liar, in clockwise turns, players must now **guess** what's on the table. This includes _all_ dice, not just their own.

* A guess consists of two numbers: which _number_ (1--6) and _how many of them_. For example: "I guess the number 5 appears 3 times on the table."
* You must guess **higher** than the previous player. This means that at least one of your numbers must be greater than the previous guess. (The other number may be kept the same, but _never less than_ the previous guess.)
* If you don't want to do that, you **challenge** the previous guess and call their bluff.
  * Reveal all the top cards of all the dice. Check if the previous guess was correct: _at least_ their guess must appear on the table.
  * If so, you were wrong and **you lose**. If not, then your challenge was correct, and the **player before you loses**. 

The loser of a round **discards** all the cards from one of their dice. They become the Liar for next round.

That's it, have fun!

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

To make the game **more unpredictable**, give players 6 random cards at the start.

To make the game **longer** (and every guessing round longer and perhaps more tense), 
* Start the players with 9 or even 12 cards. 
* Increase the minimum number (of "dice" into which to break your deck) to 3.

You might need the expansions to have enough cards for this, if you have a high player count.

{{% rules-block heading="Wildcards" %}}

This expansion adds a tiny bit of extra material: Wildcards. 

During **setup**: after dealing your starting cards, players swap one of them (secretly) for a wildcard. Keep all remaining wildcards in a single faceup pile.

During **gameplay**: a wildcard represents the _number_ of your guess. For example, if you guessed "3 5's", then any wildcard rolled will _also_ be a 5.

Finally, the loser of a round _may_ decide to swap another card for a wildcard (secretly).

{{% rules-block heading="Power Cards" %}}

This expansion adds more material: Power Cards and numbers greater than 6.

How do Power Cards work?

* On your turn to guess, if you rolled a power card, you _may_ trigger its action. (Each card can only be triggered once per round.)
* If so, simply execute the action written on the card.

Additionally, you can now **guess** _how many Power Cards_ you think there are.

* You can always raise a guess by bidding on **number of Power Cards** ...
* As long as the number you say is _greater_ than the _highest number_ of the previous guess divided by 2 (rounded down).

For example, 

* Say the previous player guessed "Number 3 appears 6 times". 
* The highest number in that bid is 6. 
* Divided by 2, it's 3. 
* As such, you can guess "X Power Cards", as long as X is greater than 3.

The extra high numbers are included because some of the powers **add an extra number**. If triggered, all players still in play add 1 card of the next highest number to their deck, as long as the material lasts.
