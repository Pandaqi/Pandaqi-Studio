Deal all players a deck of cards numbered 1--6. Keep the remaining cards to the side as a facedown draw pile.

Pick anyone to be the start player ("Liar").

{{% rules-block heading="Objective" icon="objective" %}}

For a **quick, light** game, stop playing when one player is out of cards. The player who has the most cards wins.

For a **longer, more tactical** game, keep playing until only one player has cards left. They win.

Gameplay happens in simultaneous rounds.

First, the Liar **states a number**. 
* Everyone must **divide** their deck of cards into that many piles, or so-called "dice".
* You can't have dice of only a single card, unless you have no other choice. (The Liar can't pick a number by which they can't legally abide themselves.)
* You **can't look** at the cards inside each dice.

Then everyone rolls their dice: shuffle every pile and secretly look at the card on top.

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

Starting from the Liar, in clockwise turns, players must now **guess** what's on the table. This includes _all_ dice, not just their own.

* A guess consists of two numbers: which _number_ (1--6) and _how many of them_. For example: "I guess there are 3 dice with number 5 on the table."
* You must guess **higher** than the previous player. This means that at least one of your numbers must be higher than the previous guess.
* If you don't want to do that, you **challenge** the previous guess and call their bluff.
  * Reveal all the top cards of all the dice. Check if the previous guess was correct: _at least_ their guess must appear on the table.
  * If so, you were wrong and **you lose**. If not, then your challenge was correct, and the **player before you loses**. 

The loser of a round **discards** all the cards from one of their dice. They become the Liar for next round.

That's it, have fun!

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE (also make clear that it's AT LEAST, so the real result may overshoot your guess.)

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

To make the game **more unpredictable**, give players 6 random cards at the start.

{{% rules-block heading="Wildcards" %}}

This expansion adds a tiny bit of extra material: Wildcards. 

During **setup**: after dealing your starting cards, players swap one of them (secretly) for a wildcard. Keep all remaining wildcards in a single faceup pile.

During **gameplay**: a wildcard represents the _number_ of your guess. For example, if you guessed "3 5's", then any wildcard rolled will _also_ be a 5.

Finally, the loser of a round _may_ decide to swap another card for a wildcard (secretly).

{{% rules-block heading="Power Cards" %}}

This expansion adds more material: Power Cards and numbers higher than 6.

How do Power Cards work?

* On your turn to guess, if you rolled a power card, you _may_ trigger its action. (Each card can only be triggered once per round.)
* If so, simply execute the action written on the card.

Additionally, you can now **bid** on _how many Power Cards_ you think there are.

* You can always raise a bid by bidding on Power Cards ...
* As long as the number of them is _lower_ than both numbers from the previous guess.

For example, if someone bid "5 3's" then you can say "X Power Cards", as long as X is 2 or lower.

The extra higher numbers are included because some of the powers **add an extra number**. If triggered, all players still in play add 1 card of the next highest number to their deck, as long as the material lasts.
