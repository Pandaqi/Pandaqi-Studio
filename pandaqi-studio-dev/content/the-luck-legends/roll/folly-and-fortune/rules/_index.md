Deal all players a random deck of **8 cards**. Everyone picks 2 cards of choice and places them faceup before them.

Pick anyone to be start player.

The game **ends** as soon as somebody's "die" ( = the cards in their hand) is completely empty. 

Count how much **health** each player has placed before them (indicated the heart icon on each card). Most health wins!

Take clockwise turns until done.

During the game, you'll build a row of faceup cards (from left to right) in front of you. The order and number of these cards is important.

On your turn,

* **Roll your die.** That is, shuffle the cards in your hand and reveal a random card.
* Now check the first card in your row and **its effect**. Most of these effects modify your number or give a bonus/penalty if you decide to stop here. Because ...
* You may decide to **stop here** and use your current number + effect ... or you can **reroll**. 

Whenever you roll again, you apply the power of the _next_ card in your row. So after the second roll, you look at your _second card_. After the third roll, you check your _third card_, and so forth. (The effect of your previous roll is simply completely forgotten, because you didn't stop there.)

If you run out of cards, you must stop rolling. (Yes, you can only roll as many times as you have cards before you.)

Now **attack**! Your **final value** (from your final roll + effect applied) determines the damage you do.

* Pick **another player**. If your damage is negative, however, **you attack yourself** (with the positive version of the number).
* Remove cards from the victim's row with a combined health equal to the damage you do. (You may remove _less_ than that, but never _more_.)
* You can never remove a player's final card. (Because it'd mean they can never roll again!)

Finally, add the card you "rolled" to the left or right of your row.

POSSIBLE POWERS:
* IF STOPPED: Subtract X from the result.
* IF STOPPED: Add Y to the result.
* IF STOPPED: Grab your entire row, shuffle, and place it back in a random order.
* IF STOPPED: You may attack two players.
* IF STOPPED: The card you rolled is not added to your row, but returns to your dice. (You do not attack this turn?) 
* IF STOPPED: Swap one hand card for one from the deck.
* IF STOPPED: Your attack is 0, but you draw an extra card into your hand.
* IF STOPPED: You can't attack anyone with more than X health.
* IF STOPPED: You can't attack anyone with less than X health.
* IF STOPPED: Double your current value, then discard 2 cards from your row.
* IF STOPPED: If your value is below X/Y, it's 0/6 instead
* IF STOPPED: If your value is above X/Y, it's 0/6 instead. => These are very necessary _inverters_ without saying the word.
* IF STOPPED: Swap two cards in your row.
* IF STOPPED: Roll again (without advancing to next card). That raw value is your attack.

Played the base game and ready for more? Or looking to tweak the game to fit your playing group better? Check out these variants and expansions!

{{% rules-block heading="Variants" %}}

For an even **simpler** game (perhaps to play with young children),
* Only include the cards with powers that change your number. These are easy to understand and remember when you can not read (well).
* Start with fewer cards, so the row of rerolls can't grow quite as long.
* (Optional: negative numbers simply do nothing. You can't attack yourself.)

For an even **tougher** game,
* When attacking another player, you can only ever remove **one card** (with a health below or equal to your damage).
* The only situation in which you may remove **two cards** (at most), is if your final attack is value 6 or higher.
* (Optional: you _can_ remove a player's final card, and it simply means they only get a single roll on their turns. Until their row has become longer, of course.)

{{% rules-block heading="Expansion: Superpowers" %}}

This expansion adds more types of powers on cards.

* **IF STOPPED** triggers only if you stopped here (and didn't keep rolling). All cards in the base game are this type by default.
* **IF PASSED** triggers as soon as you decide to keep rolling after this one and _stays_ on future rolls.
* **IF UNSEEN** triggers at the end of your turn if you never reached this card at all. (This is usually combined with a second effect of another type.)

IDEAS:
* "IF STOPPED: Remove any 1 card from the row of a neighbor."
* "IF STOPPED: This attack, 1 card that you removed from another player is added to your row instead."
* Something to shield/prevent a bit against opponent attacks. ("If PASSED, rotate this card sideways. It can't be lost to an attack until your next turn." or "If PASSED, your row can't go below 2 cards until next turn. Rotate this card sideways to remember.")
* Some permanent powers. ("If PASSED, every roll after this one is worth -1." or "If PASSED, you may only do 1 more reroll at most.")
* Some weird unused powers that ask you to make a decision. These often have very low health, to make them not overpowered + easy to remove.
  * ("IF PASSED: Add 3 to your value. IF UNSEEN: Draw an extra card into your hand, to a maximum of 6 cards.")
  * ("IF STOPPED: Remove 1 card from any row. IF UNSEEN: Next turn, you may roll your die using only a part of your deck at once.")
  * ("IF PASSED: Subtract 4 from your value. IF UNSEEN: Discard 1 card from your row and hand.")
  * YES, THIS MIGHT BE EVEN MORE INTERESTING IF IT HAS A **BAD** POWER ON UNUSED, almost forcing you to use it against your will.
