Place any tile with the **add** (+) action facup on the table: this is the start of the waterfall.

Give all players **4 tiles** and **1 Pawn**. Everyone places the pawn above the waterfall.

The remaining tiles become the facedown draw pile.

The game **ends** when when the waterfall **contains 20(+) cards**. 

Players sum the points on their scored tiles: **highest score wins!**

From start player, take clockwise turns until the game ends.

On your turn, you first **play cards** and then **fall down the waterfall**.

**PLAY**: Play as many hand cards as you want. 

* Sum the _numbers_ on them. That is how many spaces you're allowed to fall.
* If you have **no** cards in hand, always move 1 space.

**FALL**: For every space you move, pick one of the tiles _below_ your current tile. Go there and execute its action.

* You **can't** enter a tile that contains another player. You may only share a tile if, otherwise, getting stuck would block _all possible paths_ through the waterfall.
* If you exit the waterfall (at the bottom), reset to the top and your turn is over. (Any remaining moves are discarded.)

Everything in this game happens by executing a tile's action (when you visit it).

The main actions are ADD, DRAW and SCORE. They get a bit more explanation; all other actions are simple one-liners that can be found in the table below.

When you do an **ADD** action,
* Place a tile from your hand in the waterfall, which is a _pyramid_ shape.
* There must be a **water path** leading into the tile. (Which happens automatically if you follow the pyramid shape.)

The **DRAW** action allows drawing cards from the top of the facedown deck, into your hand.

The **SCORE** action works as follows.
* Check the _gemstones_ that you visited thus far (when falling down).
* Pick a **tile from your hand** that has a _matching gemstone_. (If none exists, just do nothing.)
* Place that tile facedown in your score pile. It's _number_ scores you points at the end of the game.
* When you take a SCORE action, your _path_ **resets**. (Pretend you didn't visit all tiles visited so far, which obviously influences what tiles you may score from now.)
