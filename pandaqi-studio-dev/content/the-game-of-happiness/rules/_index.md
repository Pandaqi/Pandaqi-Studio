Sort all cards into facedown piles, one per category. For a first game, just use the base cards, but you can add as many other sets as you want.

Pick any player to start.

The game ends once all players have taken two turns. It's cooperative, so your score merely reflects how well you did together. The "perfect score" is 10 x the number of turns.

Start player begins, then take clockwise turns until done.

On your turn, draw 5 random cards from different categories. Then use the **Rank Tokens** to rank them from left to right. Left means "this makes me most unhappy" and right means "this makes me most happy". Place the tokens facedown, where the color/icon matches the card of that category.

You can also view it as "don't like it <-> do like it", or a similar scale.

Once you're done, all the other players try to _guess_ your ranking. They also place Rank Tokens on the other side of the cards.

Once done, **reveal and compare!** Each token in the right place gives you +1 point. Guessing them ALL correctly gives another +5 points.

**Want a harder or easier game?** Change how many cards you draw on your turn.

**Want more randomness to cards?** Just put all cards into one deck and shuffle. On your turn, you simply draw 5 cards from the top. Also use the **Rank Tokens** with numbers (not categories) to indicate your ranking, where 1 is "most unhappy" and 5 is "most happy".
