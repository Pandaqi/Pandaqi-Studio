Print a game board and grab some pens. Each player invents their own unique _icon_ and draws this in the _first_ square of the board.

There are two ways to win.

* Be the **last player** to reach a finish.
* Or be the **first player** to complete the afterlife and return to the start.

Take clockwise turns until done. 

All squares on the board have bubbles around them with icons: your possible actions. **Pick 1 of these options and execute it**! Cross it out; it can never be used again.

Most options mean _moving_. To do so, cross out your icon and draw it again somewhere in your new square.

* If a square has _no_ available actions anymore, you leap over it (and can never land on it).
* Yes, it can happen that you can't move (for whatever reason). Skip your turn if so.

Once you reach a finish, you enter the **afterlife**. You keep playing, but now you walk _backwards_: from finish to start.

Once you've played the base game once or twice, you're ready for the expansion!

In the expansion, spaces can be a special _type_. Execute its effect whenever you land on them.
