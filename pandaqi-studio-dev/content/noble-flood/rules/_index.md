Create a deck of **Cards** and a deck of **Contracts**. Assign anyone to be the Dealer.

You _can_ print only the contracts and use a standard deck of cards. For the purposes of this game, the Ace is considered both the highest card ("above king") and lowest card ("below 2").

The game ends when the **deck of contracts is empty**. 

Players sum the scores on all their contracts: **highest score wins!**

Play happens in rounds. Each round has three simple phases: DEAL, PLAY and SCORE. 

{{< rules-example id="turn" >}}

{{% rules-block heading="Deal" %}}

The Dealer ...
* Places as many faceup contracts from the deck as (the number of players) + 2.
* Places 4 facedown cards from the deck in a row
* Hands all players 4 cards.

Take clockwise turns from the Dealer. Each player **may** pick one contract to fulfill from the options, but the Dealer **must** pick one.

<!--- @TODO: Or just allow picking contracts in order as long as people want? --->

{{% rules-block heading="Play" %}}

Keep taking clockwise turns from the Dealer. 

On the Dealer's turn, they first flip one of the **facedown cards faceup**. (Nobody else does this on their turn.)

On your turn, you **must play a hand card**.
* Its suit must match with an adjacent card. (Example: hearts next to hearts.)
* OR its number must be within 1 of the numbers on all its neighbor cards. (Example: 6 can be next to 5,6 or 7.)

If you can't legally play a card, discard a card (openly). 

@TODO: EXAMPLE IMAGE

You may **switch contracts** as well.
* You can only switch to a contract with a _lower_ reward than your _current_ contract.
* If you didn't start with a contract, you can't do this.

This phase ends when all players are out of cards.

<!--- @TODO: (Switching contracts forces you to reveal your hand?? I need some tiny way to gather more information about cards in the current round. Perhaps _before_ picking contracts.) --->

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Score" %}}

All players check if their contracts have been met.
* If so, place the contract faceup before you.
* If not, place it facedown before you.

At the end of the game, faceup contracts score their _plus points_, facedown contracts score their _minus points_.

The Dealer moves one player clockwise.

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! Try any of the expansions below.

{{% rules-block heading="Full Flood" %}}

This expansion adds **action cards** ( = extra material to print and cut).

These trigger a certain ability or rule, usually when played. They explain themselves.

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Straight (Hand)Shake" %}}

This expansion adds more **(special) contracts** ( = extra material to print and cut).

These contracts add a few more options and variations. Most importantly, some also add rules or powers _while you have the contract_. They explain themselves.
