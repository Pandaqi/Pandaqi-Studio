Grab helpful monsters, avoid the bad ones, cooperate, react, jump, dodge, communicate, puzzle, dream!

Allow the kid to dream for as long as possible and avoid nightmares, whatever it takes.

Because maybe ... dreams can be bad, and monsters can be good?

## Development

This is a cooperative game, so it seemed right to make the development cooperative as well.

While I develop this game, I'll publish updates every week. You can follow along, give feedback, try out the new stuff, and give suggestions.

Additionally, I record my screen as I draw/design monsters and publish the timelapses on YouTube, for people to (hopefully) learn.

This is the roadmap for development:
- **Single player support:** the core of the game is designed as a multiplayer on smartphone. With some smart tweaks and new systems, I can support single player as well.
- **PC support:** the game already works on PC. The problem? Computers have wide screens, not tall ones (like smartphones). So I need to rewrite parts of the game to support wide levels.
- **Input support:** currently, the game only supports touch. I want to support keyboard and controller/joystick as well.
- **Improve worlds 1-4:** they are too fast/difficult at the moment. By spacing out levels and removing some of the harder mechanics, I can make the introductory worlds a better ... well ... introduction.
-- **Create worlds 5-10:** I already have nice mechanics and plans lined up for all the worlds.

## What Do I Do?

**Monsters under the Bed** is a combination of action, platformer and puzzle.

Jump, run and float through randomly generated levels, in an effort to keep the kid asleep _for as long as possible_

This is a family friendly game to play together (with your children, or with friends), whilst introducing many unique puzzles and challenges never seen before.

## Features

This game has all these amazing things:
- **Platforms?** Smartphones and computers (supporting touch screen, keyboard and controllers).
- **Player count?** Single player and two player (cooperative).
- **Price?** Free on mobile, which means it is funded through advertisments. If you want to support my work, or don't like ads, consider buying the full game for only 10 dollars.
-- **Content?** Ten worlds, each containing ten levels. Every world introduces a completely new mechanic and set of monsters to the game!

## The First True Mobile Multiplayer

This game was originally designed to be played by two people on the same smartphone, sitting on opposite sides!

By rotating the view of each player upside down, you <em>must</em> cooperate, because you simply can't do everything on your own.

One player is the protective parent, another plays the dreamy sleepy kid. This makes the game ideal for parents to play with their children.

But don't let that fool you: if you want to get a good score, especially in single player, you'll need to work hard.

With each world, the game introduces more interesting mechanics and monsters. Complexity comes _not_ from making the game unfair or too hard, it comes from the wide diversity of monsters and ways to tackle them.

## Magnificent Monsters & Cuddly Creatures

Long ago, the great researcher Mona Star went on a journey to discover and catalogue all the monsters in the world!
