Play happens in rounds. Each round has three steps: bidding, playing, scoring.

@TODO: INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE?

{{% rules-block heading="Bidding" %}}

Shuffle the deck and deal as fairly as possible. (You might have a few cards left over in some rounds. Reveal them, but don't use them.)

At the start of each round, everyone secretly **places a bid**. Simultaneously, all players take a card from their hand and place it facedown in front of them. The number on that card indicates how many "tricks" you expect to win.

Once done, reveal all the bids. Any players who bid the **same suit** are---for this round only---in the **same "team"**.

{{% rules-block heading="Playing" %}}

This is a trick-taking game with a twist. You keep playing "tricks" until all players are out of cards.

So how does a trick work?

The Kittykeeper starts by playing any card they want. 
* The suit of their played card is called the **leading suit**.
* The suit of their bid card is the **trump**.

Then take clockwise turns around the table. On your turn, play one card from your hand. _If possible_, match the leading suit. Otherwise, play anything.

Once everybody has played, check who won this trick.
* If a **trump** was played, the highest trump wins.
* Otherwise, the highest card in the **leading suit** wins.

Now comes the biggest twist of this game.
* If a player played a card in the same suit as their own _bid_, that card is **ignored**. Pretend it doesn't exist.
* If _all_ cards in a trick are ignored in this way, the Kittykeeper wins.

The winner receives the trick and places it facedown before them (to track how many you've won). They become the new Kittykeeper.

{{% rules-block heading="Scoring" %}}

Once you've played all the tricks, scoring happens.

> **If you won exactly as many tricks as you bid, score your bid card!** (Add it facedown to a pile that represents your lives.)

If you were in a **team**, you also score if you _collectively_ scored the correct amount.

Exception: when ALL players are in the same team, this rule is ignored.

EXAMPLE: A and B are teamed. A bid 2, B bid 3. But at the end of the round, A has won 4 tricks and B has won 1. They're still both allowed to score, because _together_ they've scored the right amount (2 + 3 = 4 + 1). 

If this causes somebody to have 9 (or more) lives, the game ends here. Otherwise, play the next round!

You might have noticed that there are **powers** on the cards. These can be ignored for your first few games. Once you're familiar with trick-taking, however, it's highly recommended to add the rules below.

Your "bid" card starts a row in front of you.

* If you **win a trick**, pick one of its cards and place it in this row. (The other cards are discarded.)
* Your current "bid" is always the **left-most card** of this row. (So yes, your bid might change during the game.)

On each turn, you _may_

* Discard one card from your row ...
* ... to execute the power written on it!
* However, only **one power may be used per trick** (in total).

Powers are executed **before** playing your card for this trick. Unless the power specifically states some other moment at which it triggers.

{{% remark %}}
Notice that paying the card means _losing_ that trick. Which means you may not be able to score your bid anymore!
{{% /remark %}}

Powers only apply to the remainder of the _current trick_. If multiple powers contradict each other, the _last_ one played overrides the others.
