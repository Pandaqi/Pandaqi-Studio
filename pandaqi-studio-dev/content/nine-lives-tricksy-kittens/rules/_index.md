Each player receives **9 random Cards**. Order them however you want, then place them in a faceup stack before you. This is your **life deck**.

Shuffle the **Cat Deck** and deal until empty: these are your (secret) **hand cards**. Finally, pick anyone to be the Kittykeeper.

The game ends when **a player runs out of lives**. The players with the **most lives** left win.

This is a trick-taking game with a twist. 

This means that the general overview of each round is as follows.
* A single "trick" is played. 
* Once all players have played a card, the trick is done.
* One player will _win_ this trick. They become the new Kittykeeper.
* All other players **lose a life**.

Now let's see how a trick works.

The Kittykeeper starts, then take clockwise turns around the table.
* If you have cards in your hand **with the same suit as the previous card played**, you must play one of those.
* If not, you may play **any card you want**.

Instead of playing a card from your hand, you may also play your **life** ( = the top card of your life deck). Doing so activates its special power.

Once everybody has played, decide the winner.
* Count which suit was played the most. **The highest card in that suit wins the trick.**
* If there are multiple "most frequent suits", use the suit that the Kittykeeper played.
* If there are multiple "highest cards", the first card played (out of the tied cards) wins.

All cards are discarded. If you played a _life_, however, you get it back if you _win the round_! 

Next round!

Each card has a **suit**, a **number** and a **special power**.

As stated, the special power _only_ activates when the card is played as a Life Card.

Only the _top_ card of your lives deck is relevant (and can be played) at any given time. Though you're allowed to look through your life deck at any time.



@TODO:
* ISSUE 1: What if you run out of hand cards before somebody has lost all their lives? => You can always play your top life when out of cards. I just need to have enough "powers" that allow drawing more cards (or stealing, or taking cards from the last trick into your hand, etcetera.)
