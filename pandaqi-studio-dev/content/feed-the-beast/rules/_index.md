Select all the **Tier 1 Food** tokens (showing a single dot on each side). Shuffle and deal each player 10.

Pick any **beast** and place it faceup in the center of the table. (For a first game, pick a Level 1 beast.)

Create a deck of **recipe cards**, shuffle, and place 1 next to the beast. Place 4 more faceup recipes in a row: this is the "market".

@TODO: SETUP IMAGE, mostly to explain the food tiers + recipe market and such

The game ends when a player is **out of food tokens**. They win!

From start player, take clockwise turns until the game ends.

On your turn, **feed the beast!**

* Place one of your food tokens on the beast.
* If your payment is part of the Recipe Card, you get the reward listed.
* If not, you paid the wrong food and anger the beast. Their "FURY" rule triggers.

Once the beast has **10 food tokens** (or more), it **resets**. The active player swaps the Recipe Card for a new one and clears all food from the beast. (Refill the market as needed.)

That's it! Have fun!

Every beast has the following properties.

* **Rule:** a unique rule that applies to the entire game.
* **Menu:** a Recipe that is true for the entire game.
* **Fury:** what happens if you give it food it doesn't want.
* **State:** the beast can flip between two states (e.g. sleeping/awake). When you get a "state" reward, it flips to the other one.

At the top, you can see the beast's "level": higher means more difficult.

@TODO: IMAGE of BEAST CARD SKELETON

Actions explain themselves. Below are some exceptions that didn't fit within the text.

* Food is categorized into "tiers". A food's tier is represented by the number of dots on the edge: higher is "more valuable". You start with only basic food, but can purchase better ones as the game goes on.
* **Higher tier foods can substitute for ANY lower tier food.** For example, you can use a tier 2 food to pay for _any_ tier 1. (@TODO: Is this a good rule??)
* When "swapping" food tokens, you must always swap for one of the same tier (or lower).
* When an action mentions "food played", it refers to the food tokens that currently sit on top of the beast tile.

@TODO: IMAGE??

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! Try any of the expansions below.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Multi-Food Recipes" %}}

If turned on, the material will print recipes that require _multiple_ food tokens. This means you must pay that exact combination, at the same time, to get the reward (once).

This doesn't apply to "wrong food": paying the wrong food always happens one token at a time (and enrages the beast).

If you want to keep the game as long as usual, start with _more_ food tokens per player (12 or even 15).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Advanced Beasts" %}}

This expansion requires printing the **advanced beasts** too.

These are simply beasts that are harder to play or understand. Mostly because they have a _fail condition_: if this situation triggers, the game ends instantly and all players lose ( = the monster wins).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Save the Princess" %}}

This expansion requires adding new material: the **victim cards**.

During setup, create a deck of victims, shuffle, and place 4 of these next to the beast.

Whenever X HAPPENS (@TODO), one of the victims is "freed" from the beast. The player who did so, takes one card and places it before them. Their rule now applies until the end of the game.
