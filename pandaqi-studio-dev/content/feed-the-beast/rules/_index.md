Select all the **Tier 1 Food** tokens (showing a single dot on each side). Shuffle and deal each player 10.

Pick any **beast** and place it faceup in the center of the table. (For a first game, pick a Level 1 beast.)

Create a deck of **Menu cards**, shuffle, and place 1 next to the beast. Place 4 more faceup menus in a row: this is the "market".

@TODO: SETUP IMAGE, mostly to explain the food tiers + menu market and such
 => * Food is categorized into "tiers". A food's tier is represented by the number of dots on the edge: higher is "more valuable". You start with only basic food, but can purchase better ones as the game goes on.

The game ends when a player is **out of food tokens**. They win!

{{% rules-block id="action_play" heading="Gameplay" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

From start player, take clockwise turns until the game ends.

On your turn, **feed the beast!**

* Place one of your food tokens on the beast.
* If your payment is part of the Menu, you get the reward listed.
* If not, you paid the wrong food and anger the beast. Either draw a new food token (Tier 1) OR skip your next turn.

Higher tier foods can **substitute for ANY lower tier** food. For example, if you want to pay Bread for something (Tier 1), you can also pay Pie instead (Tier 2).

Once the beast has **10 food tokens** (or more), it **resets**. The active player swaps the Menu for a new one from the market, then clears all food from the beast. (Refill the market as needed.)

That's it! Have fun!

{{% rules-block id="beasts" heading="Beasts & Actions" icon="action" icontint="green" %}}

Every beast has the following properties.

* **Rule:** a unique rule that applies to the entire game.
* **State:** every beast can flip between two states (e.g. sleeping/awake). When you get a "state" reward, it flips to the other one.
* **Menu:** a single recipe that is true for the entire game.

At the top, you can see the beast's "level": higher means more difficult to play. 

If you find it hard to remember the beast's state, use the Sun/Moon token. (Faceup means the beast is in the first state, facedown means they're in the other. They always start in the first state mentioned.)

@TODO: IMAGE of BEAST CARD SKELETON

Actions explain themselves. Below are some exceptions that didn't fit within the text.

* "Swapping Tokens": you must always swap for a token of the same tier (or lower).
* "Upgrade": this means you trade one of your food tokens for one that's exactly 1 Tier higher.
* When an action mentions "food played" or a beast mentions "food stored on me", it refers to the food tokens that currently sit on top of the beast tile. (The ones that are removed when the beast "resets".)

@TODO: IMAGE??

Played the game a few times and ready for more challenge? You're in the right place! Try any of the expansions below.

{{% rules-block heading="Variant: Multi-Food Menus" %}}

If turned on, the material will print menus that sometimes require _multiple_ food tokens. 

* This means you must pay that exact combination, at the same time, to get the reward (once).
* Because of the higher cost, the rewards are usually very high.
* To balance this, it has the same penalty as paying wrong food: either **draw a Tier 1 food** (from the supply) or **skip your next turn**.

This doesn't apply to "wrong food". Paying the wrong food always happens one token at a time (and enrages the beast).

If you want to keep the game as long as usual, start with _more_ food tokens per player (12 or even 15).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Advanced Beasts" %}}

This expansion requires printing the **advanced beasts** too.

These are simply beasts that are harder to play or understand. They can have **two extra properties:**

* **FURY:** This rule triggers when you pay the "wrong food". (This happens _instead_ of the default rule.)
* **FAIL:** If the situation mentioned occurs, the game ends instantly and all players lose ( = the monster wins).

{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Save the Princess" %}}

This expansion requires adding new material: the **victim cards**.

During setup, create a deck of victims, shuffle, and place 4 of these next to the beast.

A victim is "freed" from the beast whenever a player ...

* Triggers a **reset**,
* OR for an entire round, **everyone played wrong food**
* OR for an entire round, **everyone played valid food**

The player who freed them, takes one card and places it before them. Their rule now applies until the end of the game. (This is _required_, which means you sometimes get victims that don't help you.)
