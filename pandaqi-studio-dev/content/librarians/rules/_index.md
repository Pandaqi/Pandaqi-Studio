If you manage to play _all_ the cards, you **win the game**! Otherwise, the game ends if somebody **can't play a card**. The fewer cards you have left, the better you did.

Begin with the start player, then take clockwise turns until done.

While playing, it's forbidden to explicitly communicate or reveal what's in your hand. It's up to your group how much communication around that is allowed (such as asking people not to touch a certain part of the library).

On your turn, play **at least 2** cards to the library.
* It must connect to an existing card.
* You must play to an existing shelf.
* Each shelf must be sorted _alphabetically_ by **title** (from A-Z, following the arrow).
* But you may also play a card **on top** of another card with the same letter.

Over time, the shelves might be messed up. That's why alphabetical order is simply defined as:

> The letter must come AFTER the first letter before it (to the left), and BEFORE the first letter after it (to the right). Identical letters are allowed.

@TODO: IMAGE

If you create **4 in a row** of the same **genre** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), you "complete the genre".
* Remove all cards used for matching from the board.
* Give one of them to any player, who places it faceup before them. (Discard the others.)
* This player can now, at any time during their turn, _use_ this card for its [power](#genres).
* Once used, the power is gone.

Draw back up to the hand limit (which is 4 cards by default).

<!--- Original rule said your turn ended instantly upon completing a genre, but that just feels like a useless exception at this point? --->

{{% rules-block id="genres" heading="Genres" icon="expansion" icontint="red" %}}

There are 6 different colors in the game. Each represents a general type of special power. For each game, you simply pick **one** option per color.

It's recommended to play with all 6, but ...
* Use fewer colors for a much easier game
* Or double some colors for a much harder game

Books that have multiple colors are **wildcards**. They can represent any genre when matching, but represent no action.

Below are all the genres and their actions. => @TODO

{{% rules-block heading="Red (Destructive)" %}}
These powers are _bad_ and _trigger instantly_.

* You lose the game
* You lose an outer Book Shelf. (All cards inside are discarded.)
* The Hand Limit is permanently lowered by 1
* ??
{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Green (Addition)" %}}
These powers are about adding value or bonuses.

* Add a Book Shelf card to the top or bottom
* The Hand Limit is permanently raised by 1
* You may place cards ON TOP of other cards in your turn
* ??
{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Blue (Movement)" %}}
These powers are about moving around cards, making the library more fluid.

* Move 2 cards to a new empty space adjacent to the library.
* Swap 2 cards
* Remove 2 cards from the library. You _may_ replace them with a hand card.
* ??
{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Purple (Exceptions)" %}}
These powers turn off a core rule of the game in times of need.

* No need to play any card this turn.
* No need to follow adjacency rule this turn. (You can place diagonally adjacent or leave a gap of at most 1 card.)
* No need to follow alphabetical order this turn.
* No need to follow the restriction on the number of book shelves this turn.
{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Yellow (Info)" %}}
These powers help communicate or give info to players.

* Show your hand to the table
* Tap 2 cards on the board (to give or ask hints about what to do)
* All players their hand to the player on their left/right. (The player executing the power chooses the direction.)
* Study the next 8 cards in the deck. Return them in any order and tell everyone what they are.

Or white, or orange/brown
{{% /rules-block %}}

{{% rules-block heading="Black (Chaos)" %}}
This color has weird, unique, special, disrupting powers

* Insert a card _between_ two other cards. (Move the rest to fit.)
* Shift an entire column up or down. (Cards that go out of bounds wrap to the other side.)
* Rotate a shelf card: its alphabetical order now goes in the reverse direction.
* This turn, you also complete a 4-in-a-row if it has one "wrong" genre in it.

All these variants make the game more challenging.

**Variant:** columns must be sorted alphabetically too! (Following the vertical arrow on Shelf Cards.)

**Variant:** you must play _exactly_ 2 cards on your turn. (You're not allowed to play more if that helps you, as in the original rules.)

{{% rules-block heading="Curse of the Book Shelves" %}}

**Variant:** Shelf Cards have a special power. You must listen to it at all times!

**Variant:** you must keep the shelves "balanced". 

> "The difference in stacked cards between the two sides (left and right) of a Book Shelf card can never be greater than 1."

In other words, you can't play a letter on the same letter if the number of such "stacks" on the other side of the shelf doesn't support it.
