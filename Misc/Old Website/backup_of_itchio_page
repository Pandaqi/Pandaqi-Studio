<div style="font-size:20px;"><p><strong>Package Party</strong> is a local multiplayer (“couch co-op”) game for literally anyone. Gather your friends, family, kids, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbors, neighbor’s dog – and start working together to deliver packages!
  </p>
<p>Up to 4 people must cooperate and coordinate to get those pesky boxes where they belong &hellip; without damaging them too much or arriving two hours too late.
  </p>
<p>Sounds easy, I hear you say. I could do that alone, I hear you think.
  </p>
<p>Oh, you sweet summer child. 
  </p>
<p>There will be &hellip;
  <br></p>
<ul><li>Conveyor belts
  </li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 10px solid brown; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px black;" src="https://i.imgur.com/RaqMnfD.gif"></p><ul><li>Ravines</li><li>Moving bridges
  </li><li>Gates that somehow always seem closed
  </li><li>Security cameras with lasers that kill you (people and their security these days &hellip;)</li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 10px solid brown; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px black;" src="https://i.imgur.com/GAT3Kgr.gif"></p><ul><li>Trampolines
  </li><li>Catapults
  </li><li>Farm animals that get in the way
  </li><li>Police that doesn’t like it when you run a traffic light because you’re in a hurry
  </li><li>Orders from Santa Claus himself
  </li><li>A mix of many genres: action, platforming, stealth and puzzle solving
  </li><li>And much more!
  </li></ul><p><br></p><p><img style="border: 10px solid brown; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px black;" src="https://i.imgur.com/IfsmsG8.gif"><h1 class="text-center">Is this game for me?</h1>Do you need a party game? Or a game you could play with people who’ve never played a game before? (Or those who always say "nah, I'm just not that into gaming"?)<br><br>Do you want to spend quality time with your dear ones, and do you have 1-4 players and a (somewhat) working computer? 
  </p>
<p>Then Package Party might be the game for you.</p><p><br></p></div>

As the game progresses, only the most capable and talented delivery workers will be able to get that three star score!<br></p><p><br></p>

<h1 class="text-center">Succeed together, fail together</h1>
<p>This game was designed to be <em>cooperative</em> and <em>local multiplayer</em>.<br></p>
<p>Why did I do this? Because I think local multiplayer games are awesome and the strongest form of gaming. Sure, there’s many online multiplayer games, but local co-op will always have my preference. It’s just a stronger experience, as you’re physically close to each other and can actually communicate by speaking, gestures, pointing, taking over somebody else’s controller, whatever.
  </p>
<p>This game will allow you to connect with anyone (friends, family, partner, stranger on the bus) and have a fun time together, in real life. This is, in my opinion, what games are meant to be.
  </p>
<p>I’ve seen couch co-op games start new relationships, strengthen current relationships, and generally lead to a quality time for everyone. (Even those who aren’t playing, but just watching.)
  </p>
<p>That’s the force of good I want to be in this world: to make people laugh, cooperate, talk, and play together. And to introduce non-gamers, or only casual gamers, to a whole new world of possibilities and awesome experiences.

<h1 class="text-center">Early Access</h1><p>Thank you for checking out my game! 
  </p>
<p>It’s currently in <em>early access</em>. These features are available:
  </p>
<ul><li>Support for 1-4 Players =&gt; any controller and keyboard combination is supported.
  </li><li>Support for Windows, Mac and Linux.
  </li><li>Two worlds, with 13 levels, which are polished ( = completely playable and bug-free).
  </li></ul>
<p>The usual warnings are in order:
  </p>
<ul><li>The story (text + videos) isn’t finished, it’s all about gameplay at the moment.
  </li><li>Similarly, the art and the interface isn’t final. I always try to make the game look visually appealing every step of the way, but the real polishing will only happen once the game is done.
  </li><li>Levels aren’t balanced yet. It’s currently on the easy side of things. As I get more playtests done and more feedback, balancing will automatically happen.
  </li></ul>
<p>The final game will have the following features:
  </p>
<ul><li>10 worlds and roughly 100 levels in total.
  </li><li>A new mechanic/gimmick/special element introduced in each level.
  </li><li>An interesting and funny story running through the levels, which also influences level design.
  </li><li>A mix between many genres: <em>action</em>, <em>3d</em> <em>platforming</em>, <em>puzzle solving, stealth</em>, and more.
  </li><li>Hopefully, lots of cooperative fun!</li></ul>
  <p>As usual, if you buy the game now, you’ll get all future updates. Every time I put out a big update, the price will be raised. The final game will cost around 25 euros – but that is just a rough estimation at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p style="text-align:center;"><img style="border: 10px solid brown; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px black;" src="https://i.imgur.com/HEz2T0P.gif"><br></p></div>
