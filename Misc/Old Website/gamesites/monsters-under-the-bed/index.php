					<h2>Development</h2>
					<p>This is a cooperative game, so it seemed right to make the development cooperative as well.</p>
					<p>While I develop this game, I'll publish updates every week. You can follow along, give feedback, try out the new stuff, and give suggestions.</p>
					<p>Additionally, I record my screen as I draw/design monsters and publish the timelapses on YouTube, for people to (hopefully) learn.</p>
					<p>This is the roadmap for development:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Single player support:</strong> the core of the game is designed as a multiplayer on smartphone. With some smart tweaks and new systems, I can support single player as well.</li>
						<li><strong>PC support:</strong> the game already works on PC. The problem? Computers have wide screens, not tall ones (like smartphones). So I need to rewrite parts of the game to support wide levels.</li>
						<li><strong>Input support:</strong> currently, the game only supports touch. I want to support keyboard and controller/joystick as well.</li>
						<li><strong>Improve worlds 1-4:</strong> they are too fast/difficult at the moment. By spacing out levels and removing some of the harder mechanics, I can make the introductory worlds a better ... well ... introduction.</li>
						<li><strong>Create worlds 5-10:</strong> I already have nice mechanics and plans lined up for all the worlds.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>What do I do?</h2>
					<p><strong>Monsters under the Bed</strong> is a combination of action, platformer and puzzle.</p>
					<p>Jump, run and float through randomly generated levels, in an effort to keep the kid asleep <em>for as long as possible</em>.</p>
					<p>This is a family friendly game to play together (with your children, or with friends), whilst introducing many unique puzzles and challenges never seen before.</p>

					<h2>Features</h2>
					<p>This game has all these amazing things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Platforms?</strong> Smartphones and computers (supporting touch screen, keyboard and controllers).</li>
						<li><strong>Player count?</strong> Single player and two player (cooperative).</li>
						<li><strong>Price?</strong> Free on mobile, which means it is funded through advertisments. If you want to support my work, or don't like ads, consider buying the full game for only 10 dollars.</li>
						<li><strong>Content?</strong> Ten worlds, each containing ten levels. Every world introduces a completely new mechanic and set of monsters to the game!</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>The first true mobile multiplayer</h2>
					<p>This game was originally designed to be played by two people on the same smartphone, sitting on opposite sides!</p>
					<p>By rotating the view of each player upside down, you <em>must</em> cooperate, because you simply can't do everything on your own.</p>
					<p>One player is the protective parent, another plays the dreamy sleepy kid. This makes the game ideal for parents to play with their children.</p>
					<p>But don't let that fool you: if you want to get a good score, especially in single player, you'll need to work hard.</p>
					<p>With each world, the game introduces more interesting mechanics and monsters. Complexity comes <em>not</em> from making the game unfair or too hard, it comes from the wide diversity of monsters and ways to tackle them.</p>

					<h2>Magnificent Monsters & Cuddly Creatures</h2>
					<p>Long ago, the great researcher Mona Star went on a journey to discover and catalogue all the monsters in the world!</p>
