					<h2>What's the idea?</h2>
					<p>Hades has some trouble controlling his underworld. There are just too many souls arriving! And all of them have different needs, curses and treatments!</p>
					<p>He has asked you to take care of his troubles. The player who wins ( = TO DO OBJECTIVE HERE) will officially receive the job as Conductor of the Underground, for all eternity. Isnâ€™t that nice?</p>
